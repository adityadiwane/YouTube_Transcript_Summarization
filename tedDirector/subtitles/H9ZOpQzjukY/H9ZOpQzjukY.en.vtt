00:00:13.072 --> 00:00:16.786
Today's computers are so amazing

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.931
that we fail to notice
how terrible they really are.

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:24.570
I'd like to talk to you today
about this problem,

00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:27.265
and how we can fix it with neuroscience.

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:32.073
First, I'd like to take you back
to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011

00:00:32.097 --> 00:00:33.884
that had a profound impact on me.

00:00:34.437 --> 00:00:37.611
I was sitting in a dive bar
outside of Columbia University,

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:40.543
where I studied computer science
and neuroscience,

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:43.635
and I was having this great conversation
with a fellow student

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.962
about the power of holograms
to one day replace computers.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.479
And just as we were getting
to the best part of the conversation,

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:52.065
of course, his phone lights up.

00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:57.046
And he pulls it towards himself,
and he looks down and he starts typing.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.253
And then he forces his eyeballs
back up to mine and he goes,

00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:02.380
"Keep going. I'm with you."

00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:04.761
But of course his eyes were glazed over,

00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:06.128
and the moment was dead.

00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:08.184
Meanwhile across the bar,

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:10.492
I noticed another student
holding his phone,

00:01:10.516 --> 00:01:11.961
this time towards a group.

00:01:11.985 --> 00:01:14.745
He was swiping through
pictures on Instagram,

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:17.303
and these kids were laughing hysterically.

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:20.846
And that dichotomy
between how crappy I was feeling

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.648
and how happy they were feeling
about the same technology,

00:01:23.672 --> 00:01:25.050
really got me thinking.

00:01:25.074 --> 00:01:27.407
And the more I thought of it,
the more I realized

00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:31.203
it was clearly not the digital information
that was the bad guy here,

00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:34.934
it was simply the display position
that was separating me from my friend

00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.179
and that was binding those kids together.

00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:39.807
See, they were connected around something,

00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:43.229
just like our ancestors
who evolved their social cognitions

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:45.298
telling stories around the campfire.

00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:48.201
And that's exactly what tools
should do, I think.

00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:49.704
They should extend our bodies.

00:01:49.728 --> 00:01:52.397
And I think computers today
are doing quite the opposite.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.167
Whether you're sending
an email to your wife

00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:57.213
or you're composing a symphony

00:01:57.237 --> 00:01:58.841
or just consoling a friend,

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:01.211
you're doing it in pretty
much the same way.

00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:03.468
You're hunched over these rectangles,

00:02:03.492 --> 00:02:06.243
fumbling with buttons and menus
and more rectangles.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.756
And I think this is the wrong way,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.208
I think we can start using
a much more natural machine.

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:15.750
We should use machines that bring
our work back into the world.

00:02:15.774 --> 00:02:18.793
We should use machines that use
the principles of neuroscience

00:02:18.817 --> 00:02:22.816
to extend our senses
versus going against them.

00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:26.092
Now it just so happens
that I have such a machine here.

00:02:26.116 --> 00:02:27.273
It's called the Meta 2.

00:02:27.297 --> 00:02:28.487
Let's try it out.

00:02:37.617 --> 00:02:40.430
Now in front of me right now,
I can see the audience,

00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:42.488
and I can see my very hands.

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:45.203
And in three, two, one,

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:47.979
we're going to see an immersive
hologram appear,

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:50.283
a very realistic hologram
appear in front of me,

00:02:50.307 --> 00:02:52.871
of our very glasses I'm wearing
on my head right now.

00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:55.736
And of course this could be
anything that we're shopping for

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.911
or learning from,

00:02:56.935 --> 00:02:58.278
and I can use my hands

00:02:58.302 --> 00:03:02.410
to very nicely kind of move
it around with fine control.

00:03:02.434 --> 00:03:05.629
And I think Iron Man would be proud.

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:09.021
We're going to come back
to this in just a bit.

00:03:09.783 --> 00:03:11.947
(Applause)

00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:14.882
Now if you're anything like me,
your mind is already reeling

00:03:14.906 --> 00:03:18.207
with the possibilities of what we can do
with this kind of technology,

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.389
so let's look at a few.

00:03:19.413 --> 00:03:20.563
My mom is an architect,

00:03:20.587 --> 00:03:22.492
so naturally the first thing I imagined

00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:24.997
was laying out a building in 3D space

00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:27.413
instead of having to use
these 2D floor plans.

00:03:27.437 --> 00:03:29.902
She's actually touching graphics right now

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:31.703
and selecting an interior decor.

00:03:31.727 --> 00:03:35.091
This was all shot through a GoPro
through our very glasses.

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:37.730
And this next use case
is very personal to me,

00:03:37.754 --> 00:03:41.168
it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's
glass brain project,

00:03:41.192 --> 00:03:43.083
courtesy of UCSF.

00:03:43.107 --> 00:03:44.802
As a neuroscience student,

00:03:44.826 --> 00:03:46.223
I would always fantasize

00:03:46.247 --> 00:03:51.686
about the ability to learn and memorize
these complex brain structures

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.877
with an actual machine,

00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:56.203
where I could touch and play
with the various brain structures.

00:03:56.535 --> 00:04:00.061
Now what you're seeing
is called augmented reality,

00:04:00.085 --> 00:04:03.036
but to me, it's part
of a much more important story --

00:04:03.512 --> 00:04:10.203
a story of how we can begin
to extend our bodies with digital devices,

00:04:10.227 --> 00:04:12.711
instead of the other way around.

00:04:13.734 --> 00:04:15.203
Now ...

00:04:15.227 --> 00:04:18.589
in the next few years, humanity's
going to go through a shift, I think.

00:04:18.613 --> 00:04:21.826
We're going to start putting
an entire layer of digital information

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.285
on the real world.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.318
Just imagine for a moment

00:04:25.342 --> 00:04:27.602
what this could mean for storytellers,

00:04:27.626 --> 00:04:28.941
for painters,

00:04:28.965 --> 00:04:31.123
for brain surgeons,

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:32.964
for interior decorators

00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:35.099
and maybe for all of us here today.

00:04:35.544 --> 00:04:37.711
And what I think we need
to do as a community,

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:39.727
is really try and make an effort

00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:42.642
to imagine how we can
create this new reality

00:04:42.666 --> 00:04:45.364
in a way that extends
the human experience,

00:04:45.388 --> 00:04:47.356
instead of gamifying our reality

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.443
or cluttering it with digital information.

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:51.589
And that's what I'm very passionate about.

00:04:52.318 --> 00:04:54.479
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:55.670
In about five years --

00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:57.320
this is not the smallest device --

00:04:57.344 --> 00:04:58.512
in about five years,

00:04:58.536 --> 00:05:01.464
these are all going to look like
strips of glass on our eyes

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:02.807
that project holograms.

00:05:03.426 --> 00:05:06.736
And just like we don't care so much
about which phone we buy

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.181
in terms of the hardware -- we buy it
for the operating system --

00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:11.364
as a neuroscientist,

00:05:11.388 --> 00:05:15.431
I always dreamt of building
the iOS of the mind, if you will.

00:05:16.537 --> 00:05:19.417
And it's very, very important
that we get this right,

00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:21.735
because we might be living
inside of these things

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.447
for at least as long as we've lived

00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:26.112
with the Windows graphical user interface.

00:05:26.136 --> 00:05:27.453
And I don't know about you,

00:05:27.477 --> 00:05:29.985
but living inside of Windows scares me.

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:31.329
(Laughter)

00:05:31.353 --> 00:05:35.243
To isolate the single most intuitive
interface out of infinity,

00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:37.947
we use neuroscience to drive
our design guidelines,

00:05:37.971 --> 00:05:41.561
instead of letting a bunch of designers
fight it out in the boardroom.

00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:44.234
And the principle we all revolve around

00:05:44.258 --> 00:05:47.266
is what's called the "Neural Path
of Least Resistance."

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.421
At every turn, we're connecting
the iOS of the brain with our brain

00:05:51.445 --> 00:05:53.831
on, for the first time, our brain's terms.

00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:58.247
In other words, we're trying to create
a zero learning-curve computer.

00:05:58.738 --> 00:06:02.073
We're building a system
that you've always known how to use.

00:06:02.097 --> 00:06:04.990
Here are the first three
design guidelines that we employ

00:06:05.014 --> 00:06:07.345
in this brand-new form of user experience.

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:10.763
First and foremost,
you are the operating system.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.494
Traditional file systems
are complex and abstract,

00:06:13.518 --> 00:06:16.109
and they take your brain
extra steps to decode them.

00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:18.938
We're going against the Neural Path
of Least Resistance.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:21.160
Meanwhile, in augmented reality,

00:06:21.184 --> 00:06:26.159
you can of course place
your holographic TED panel over here,

00:06:26.183 --> 00:06:29.734
and your holographic email
on the other side of the desk,

00:06:29.758 --> 00:06:35.581
and your spatial memory evolved just fine
to go ahead and retrieve them.

00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:38.633
You could put your holographic Tesla
that you're shopping for --

00:06:38.657 --> 00:06:42.162
or whatever model my legal team
told me to put in right before the show.

00:06:42.186 --> 00:06:43.188
(Laughter)

00:06:43.212 --> 00:06:45.944
Perfect. And your brain knows
exactly how to get it back.

00:06:45.968 --> 00:06:49.216
The second interface guideline
we call "touch to see."

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.300
What do babies do when they see
something that grabs their interest?

00:06:54.712 --> 00:06:56.428
They try and reach out and touch it.

00:06:56.452 --> 00:06:59.519
And that's exactly how the natural
machine should work as well.

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:02.927
Turns out the visual system
gets a fundamental boost

00:07:02.951 --> 00:07:05.360
from a sense we call proprioception --

00:07:05.384 --> 00:07:07.629
that's the sense
of our body parts in space.

00:07:07.653 --> 00:07:11.463
So by touching our work directly,
we're not only going to control it better,

00:07:11.487 --> 00:07:14.065
we're also going to understand
it much more deeply.

00:07:14.637 --> 00:07:16.299
Hence, touch to see.

00:07:16.323 --> 00:07:18.718
But it's not enough
to experience things ourselves.

00:07:18.742 --> 00:07:20.969
We're inherently these social primates.

00:07:20.993 --> 00:07:23.105
And this leads me to our third guideline,

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:25.926
the holographic campfire
from our first story.

00:07:26.537 --> 00:07:28.451
Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests

00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:32.023
that we can connect with each other
and with our work much better

00:07:32.047 --> 00:07:35.032
if we can see each other's
faces and hands in 3D.

00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:36.893
So if you look at the video behind me,

00:07:36.917 --> 00:07:41.226
you can see two Meta users
playing around with the same hologram,

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.965
making eye contact,
connected around this thing,

00:07:43.989 --> 00:07:46.680
instead of being distracted
by external devices.

00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:52.624
Let's go ahead and try this again
with neuroscience in mind.

00:07:56.127 --> 00:07:59.471
So again, our favorite interface,
the iOS of the mind.

00:08:00.315 --> 00:08:02.226
I'm going to now take a step further

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.000
and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses

00:08:05.024 --> 00:08:06.744
and leave it right here by the desk.

00:08:06.768 --> 00:08:08.490
I'm now with you, I'm in the moment,

00:08:08.514 --> 00:08:09.666
we're connecting.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.608
My spatial memory kicks in,
and I can go ahead and grab it

00:08:12.632 --> 00:08:14.733
and bring it right back here, reminding me

00:08:14.757 --> 00:08:16.643
that I am the operating system.

00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:19.047
And now my proprioception is working,

00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:22.867
and I can go ahead and explode
these glasses into a thousand parts

00:08:22.891 --> 00:08:27.281
and touch the very sensor
that is currently scanning my hand.

00:08:27.305 --> 00:08:29.266
But it's not enough to see things alone,

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.262
so in a second, my co-founder Ray
is going to make a 3D call --

00:08:32.286 --> 00:08:33.444
Ray?

00:08:33.468 --> 00:08:34.954
(Ringing)

00:08:35.387 --> 00:08:36.883
Hey Ray, how's it going?

00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:40.335
Guys, I can see this guy
in front me in full 3D.

00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:42.656
And he is photo-realistic.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.976
(Applause)

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.152
Thank you.

00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:49.157
My mirror-neuron subsystem suggests
that this is going to replace phones

00:08:49.181 --> 00:08:50.577
in not too long.

00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:52.419
Ray, how's it going?

00:08:52.443 --> 00:08:54.808
Ray: Great. We're live today.

00:08:54.832 --> 00:08:56.381
(Applause)

00:08:56.405 --> 00:08:58.517
MG: Ray, give the crowd a gift

00:08:58.541 --> 00:09:01.176
of the holographic brain
we saw from the video earlier.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.358
Guys, this is not only
going to change phones,

00:09:03.382 --> 00:09:06.192
it's also going to change
the way we collaborate.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.963
Thank you so much.

00:09:07.987 --> 00:09:09.145
Thanks, Ray.

00:09:09.169 --> 00:09:10.320
Ray: You're welcome.

00:09:10.344 --> 00:09:11.351
(Applause)

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:16.323
MG: So folks, this is the message
that I discovered in that bar in 2011:

00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:20.488
The future of computers is not
locked inside one of these screens.

00:09:20.944 --> 00:09:23.711
It's right here, inside of us.

00:09:25.876 --> 00:09:29.455
(Applause)

00:09:29.923 --> 00:09:32.836
So if there's one idea that I could
leave you with here today,

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.916
it's that the natural machine
is not some figment of the future,

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.973
it's right here in 2016.

00:09:38.447 --> 00:09:41.222
Which is why all hundred of us at Meta,

00:09:41.246 --> 00:09:42.921
including the administrative staff,

00:09:42.945 --> 00:09:44.387
the executives,

00:09:44.411 --> 00:09:46.134
the designers, the engineers --

00:09:46.158 --> 00:09:48.060
before TED2017,

00:09:48.084 --> 00:09:51.741
we're all going to be throwing
away our external monitors

00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:56.885
and replacing them with a truly
and profoundly more natural machine.

00:09:56.909 --> 00:09:58.100
Thank you very much.

00:09:58.124 --> 00:09:59.925
(Applause)

00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:03.372
Thank you, appreciate it.

00:10:05.501 --> 00:10:06.658
Thanks, guys.

00:10:09.928 --> 00:10:12.772
Chris Anderson: So help
me out on one thing,

00:10:12.796 --> 00:10:15.424
because there've been a few
augmented reality demos

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:18.154
shown over the last year or so out there.

00:10:18.178 --> 00:10:20.587
And there's sometimes
a debate among technologists

00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:24.316
about, are we really seeing
the real thing on-screen?

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.080
There's this issue of field of view,

00:10:26.104 --> 00:10:29.570
that somehow the technology
is showing a broader view

00:10:29.594 --> 00:10:32.515
than you would actually see
wearing the glasses.

00:10:33.086 --> 00:10:34.809
Were we seeing the real deal there?

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:36.246
MG: Absolutely the real deal.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.427
Not only that,

00:10:37.451 --> 00:10:40.788
we took extra measures to shoot it
with a GoPro through the actual lens

00:10:40.812 --> 00:10:42.865
in the various videos
that you've seen here.

00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:45.465
We want to try to simulate
the experience for the world

00:10:45.489 --> 00:10:47.682
that we're actually seeing
through the glasses,

00:10:47.706 --> 00:10:48.857
and not cut any corners.

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:50.905
CA: Thank you so much for showing us that.

00:10:50.929 --> 00:10:52.754
MG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that.
