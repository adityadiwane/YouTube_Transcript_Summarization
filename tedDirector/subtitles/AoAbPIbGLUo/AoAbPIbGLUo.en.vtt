00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.296
When you come to TEDx,
you always think about technology,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.656
the world changing,
becoming more innovative.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.456
You think about the driverless.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.896
Everyone's talking
about driverless cars these days,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.016
and I love the concept
of a driverless car,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.536
but when I go in one, you know,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.480
I want it really slow,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.720
I want access to the steering wheel
and the brake, just in case.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.240
I don't know about you,
but I am not ready for a driverless bus.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.320
I am not ready for a driverless airplane.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.560
How about a driverless world?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.480
And I ask you that

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.080
because we are increasingly in one.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.776
It's not supposed to be that way.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.576
We're number one,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.496
the United States is large and in charge.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.336
Americanization and globalization
for the last several generations

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.016
have basically been the same thing.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.856
Right? Whether it's
the World Trade Organization

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.216
or it's the IMF, the World Bank,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.076
the Bretton Woods Accord on currency,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.856
these were American institutions,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.496
our values, our friends, our allies,
our money, our standards.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.600
That was the way the world worked.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.176
So it's sort of interesting,
if you want to look at how the US looks,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.416
here it is.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.736
This is our view of how the world is run.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.576
President Obama has got the red carpet,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.416
he goes down Air Force One,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.976
and it feels pretty good,
it feels pretty comfortable.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.616
Well, I don't know how many of you
saw the China trip last week

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.696
and the G20.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.936
Oh my God. Right?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.616
This is how we landed

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.136
for the most important meeting
of the world's leaders in China.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.136
The National Security Advisor
was actually spewing expletives

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.976
on the tarmac --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.416
no red carpet,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.096
kind of left out the bottom of the plane

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.920
along with all the media
and everybody else.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.896
Later on in the G20,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.440
well, there's Obama.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.696
(Laughter)

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.336
Hi, George.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.560
Hi, Norman.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.216
They look like they're
about to get into a cage match, right?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.336
And they did. It was 90 minutes long,
and they talked about Syria.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.256
That's what Putin wanted to talk about.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.016
He's increasingly calling the shots.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.656
He's the one willing to do stuff there.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.856
There's not a lot of mutual like or trust,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.736
but it's not as if the Americans
are telling him what to do.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.096
How about when the whole 20
are getting together?

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.073
Surely, when the leaders are all onstage,

00:02:49.097 --> 00:02:51.176
then the Americans
are pulling their weight.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.616
Uh-oh.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.400
(Laughter)

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.856
Xi Jinping seems fine.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.776
Angela Merkel has -- she always does --

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.176
that look, she always does that.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.216
But Putin is telling
Turkish president Erdogan what to do,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.840
and Obama is like,
what's going on over there?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.176
You see. And the problem is
it's not a G20,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.416
the problem is

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.416
it's a G-Zero world that we live in,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.856
a world order where there is
no single country or alliance

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.256
that can meet the challenges
of global leadership.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.160
The G20 doesn't work,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.320
the G7, all of our friends,
that's history.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.376
So globalization is continuing.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.056
Goods and services and people
and capital are moving across borders

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.096
faster and faster than ever before,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.160
but Americanization is not.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.456
So if I've convinced you of that,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.216
I want to do two things
with the rest of this talk.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.696
I want to talk
about the implications of that

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.976
for the whole world.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.536
I'll go around it.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.176
And then I want to talk about

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.096
what we think right here

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.536
in the United States and in New York.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.176
So why? What are the implications.
Why are we here?

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.016
Well, we're here

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.416
because the United States,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.256
we spent two trillion dollars
on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.496
that were failed.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.136
We don't want to do that anymore.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.816
We have large numbers
of middle and working classes

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.936
that feel like they've not benefited
from promises of globalization,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.000
so they don't want to see it particularly.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.296
And we have an energy revolution

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.496
where we don't need OPEC
or the Middle East the way we used to.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.976
We produce all that right here
in the United States.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.336
So the Americans don't want
to be the global sheriff for security

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.656
or the architect of global trade.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.096
The Americans don't want to even be
the cheerleader of global values.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.776
Well, then you look to Europe,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.896
and the most important
alliance in the world

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.656
has been the transatlantic relationship.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.056
But it is now weaker than it has been
at any point since World War II,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.656
all of the crises,
the Brexit conversations,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.776
the hedging going on
between the French and the Russians,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.400
or the Germans and the Turks,
or the Brits and the Chinese.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.936
China does want to do more leadership.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.976
They do, but only in the economic sphere,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.096
and they want their own values,
standards, currency,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.216
in competition with that of the US.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.176
The Russians want to do more leadership.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.256
You see that in Ukraine,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.136
in the Baltic states, in the Middle East,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.896
but not with the Americans.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.536
They want their own preferences and order.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.456
That's why we are where we are.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.776
So what happens going forward?

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.936
Let's start easy,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.160
with the Middle East.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.880
(Laughter)

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.176
You know, I left a little out,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.536
but you get the general idea.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.976
Look, there are three reasons

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.056
why the Middle East
has had stability such as it is. Right?

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.176
One is because there was
a willingness to provide

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.576
some level of military security
by the US and allies.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.256
Number two, it was easy to take
a lot of cheap money out of the ground

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.056
because oil was expensive.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.416
And number three

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.536
was no matter how bad the leaders were,
the populations were relatively quiescent.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.336
They didn't have the ability,
and many didn't have the will

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.816
to really rise up against.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.376
Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.016
all three of those things
are increasingly not true,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.376
and so failed states,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.616
terrorism, refugees and the rest.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.576
Does the entire Middle East fall apart?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.456
No, the Kurds will do better,
and Iraq, Israel, Iran over time.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.856
But generally speaking,
it's not a good look.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.256
OK, how about this guy?

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.736
He's playing a poor hand very well.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.656
There's no question
he's hitting above his weight.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.936
But long term -- I didn't mean that.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.256
But long term, long term,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.936
if you think that the Russians

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.576
were antagonized by the US and Europe
expanding NATO right up to their borders

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.246
when we said they weren't going to,

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.656
and the EU encroaching them,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.136
just wait until the Chinese
put hundreds of billions of dollars

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.296
in every country around Russia
they thought they had influence in.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.976
The Chinese are going to dominate it.
The Russians are picking up the crumbs.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.360
In a G-Zero world, this is going to be
a very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.696
It's not all bad. Right?

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.976
Asia actually looks a lot better.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.176
There are real leaders across Asia,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.576
they have a lot of political stability.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.856
They're there for a while.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.136
Mr. Modi in India,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.136
Mr. Abe, who is probably
about to get a third term written in

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.136
in the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.296
of course Xi Jinping
who is consolidating enormous power,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.656
the most powerful leader in China

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.336
since Mao.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.576
Those are the three
most important economies in Asia.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.416
Now look, there are problems in Asia.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.096
We see the sparring
over the South China Sea.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.816
We see that Kim Jong Un,
just in the last couple of days,

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.016
tested yet another nuclear weapon.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.296
But the leaders in Asia
do not feel the need

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.856
to wave the flag,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.696
to go xenophobic,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.776
to actually allow escalation

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.296
of the geopolitical
and cross-border tensions.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.696
They want to focus on long-term
economic stability and growth.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.720
And that's what they're actually doing.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.120
Let's turn to Europe.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.896
Europe does look a little scared
in this environment.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.216
So much of what is happening
in the Middle East

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.976
is washing up quite literally
onto European shores.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.775
You see Brexit and you see
the concerns of populism

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:55.376
across all of the European states.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.056
Let me tell you that over the long term,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.856
in a G-Zero world,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.600
European expansion
will be seen to have gone too far.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.296
Europe went right up to Russia,
went right down to the Middle East,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.576
and if the world were truly becoming
more flat and more Americanized,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.176
that would be less of a problem,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.696
but in a G-Zero world,
those countries nearest Russia

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.336
and nearest the Middle East

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.736
actually have different
economic capabilities,

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.576
different social stability

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.776
and different political preferences
and systems than core Europe.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.816
So Europe was able to truly expand

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.896
under the G7,

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.456
but under the G-Zero,
Europe will get smaller.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.496
Core Europe around Germany
and France and others

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.576
will still work, be functional,
stable, wealthy, integrated.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.016
But the periphery,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.496
countries like Greece
and Turkey and others,

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.920
will not look that good at all.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.576
Latin America, a lot of populism,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.616
made the economies not go so well.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.496
They had been more opposed
to the United States for decades.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.456
Increasingly, they're coming back.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.136
We see that in Argentina.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.896
We see it with the openness in Cuba.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.136
We will see it in Venezuela
when Maduro falls.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.176
We will see it in Brazil
after the impeachment

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.080
and when we finally see
a new legitimate president elected there.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.816
The only place you see
that is moving in another direction

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.416
is the unpopularity
of Mexican president Peña Nieto.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.296
There you could actually see
a slip away from the United States

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.576
over the coming years.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.616
The US election matters a lot
on that one, too.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.960
(Laughter)

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.416
Africa, right?

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.656
A lot of people have said
it's going to be Africa's decade, finally.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.216
In a G-Zero world,
it is absolutely an amazing time

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.976
for a few African countries,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.656
those governed well
with a lot of urbanization,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.176
a lot of smart people,
women really getting into the workforce,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.176
entrepreneurship taking off.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.976
But for most of the countries in Africa,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.896
it's going to be a lot more dicey:

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.936
extreme climate conditions,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.176
radicalism both from Islam
and also Christianity,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.616
very poor governance,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.656
borders you can't defend,
lots of forced migration.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.776
Those countries can fall off the map.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.536
So you're really going to see
an extreme segregation going on

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.896
between the winners
and the losers across Africa.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.816
Finally, back to the United States.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.456
What do I think about us?

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.216
Because there are a lot of upset people,

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.896
not here at TEDx, I know,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.696
but in the United States, my God,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.176
after 15 months of campaigning,
we should be upset.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.176
I understand that.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.456
But a lot of people are upset
because they say, "Washington's broken,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.976
we don't trust the establishment,
we hate the media."

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.136
Heck, even globalists like me
are taking it on the chin.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.776
Look, I do think we have to recognize,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.016
my fellow campers,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.456
that when you are being
chased by the bear,

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.776
in the global context,
you need not outrun the bear,

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.416
you need to only outrun
your fellow campers.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.520
(Laughter)

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.856
Now, I just told you

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.976
about our fellow campers.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.936
Right? And from that perspective,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.976
we look OK.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.016
A lot of people in that context say,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.536
"Let's go dollar.
Let's go New York real estate.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.616
Let's send our kids
to American universities."

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.776
You know, our neighbors are awesome:

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.656
Canada, Mexico
and two big bodies of water.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:35.056
You know how much Turkey
would love to have neighbors like that?

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.160
Those are awesome neighbors.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.696
Terrorism is a problem
in the United States.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.016
God knows we know it here in New York.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.517
But it's a much bigger problem
in Europe than the US.

00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:48.856
It's a much bigger problem
in the Middle East

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.456
than it is in Europe.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.616
These are factors of large magnitude.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.616
We just accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees,
and we're complaining bitterly about it.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.456
You know why?
Because they can't swim here.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.176
Right? I mean, the Turks would love
to have only 10,000 Syrian refugees.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.496
The Jordanians,
the Germans, the Brits. Right?

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.776
That's not the situation.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.976
That's the reality of the United States.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.560
Now, that sounds pretty good.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.576
Here's the challenge.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.680
In a G-Zero world, the way you lead

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.216
is by example.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.256
If we know we don't want to be
the global cop anymore,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.233
if we know we're not going to be
the architect of global trade,

00:13:30.257 --> 00:13:32.856
we're not going to be
the cheerleader of global values,

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.976
we're not going to do it
the way we used to,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.381
the 21st century is changing,

00:13:36.405 --> 00:13:39.256
we need to lead by example --
be so compelling

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.696
that all these other people
are going to still say,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.536
it's not just they're faster campers.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.656
Even when the bear is not chasing us,
this is a good place to be.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.040
We want to emulate them.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.320
The election process this year
is not proving a good option

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.720
for leading by example.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.096
Hillary Clinton says
it's going to be like the '90s.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.056
We can still be
that cheerleader on values.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.576
We can still be
the architect of global trade.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.296
We can still be the global sheriff.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.400
And Donald Trump wants
to bring us back to the '30s.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.496
He's saying, "Our way or the highway.
You don't like it, lump it." Right?

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.376
Neither are recognizing
a fundamental truth of the G-Zero,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.176
which is that even though
the US is not in decline,

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.736
it is getting objectively harder

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.936
for the Americans to impose their will,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.656
even have great influence,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.680
on the global order.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.176
Are we prepared to truly lead by example?

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.256
What would we have to do to fix this

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.496
after November,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.696
after the next president comes in?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.376
Well, either we have to have
another crisis that forces us to respond.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.056
A depression would do that.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.256
Another global financial
crisis could do this.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.296
God forbid, another 9/11 could do that.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.776
Or, absent crisis,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:01.936
we need to see that the hollowing out,
the inequality, the challenges

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.336
that are growing and growing
in the United States,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.536
are themselves urgent enough

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.896
to force our leaders to change,

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.376
and that we have those voices.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.296
Through our cell phones, individually,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.400
we have those voices
to compel them to change.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.200
There is, of course, a third choice,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.176
perhaps the most likely one,

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.896
which is that we do
neither of those things,

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.496
and in four years time you invite me back,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.720
and I will give this speech yet again.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.176
Thank you very, very much.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.085
(Applause)
