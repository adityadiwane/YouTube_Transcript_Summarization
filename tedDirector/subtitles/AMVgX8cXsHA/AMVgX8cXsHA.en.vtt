00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.236
"These are the times,"

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.276
said Thomas Paine,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.180
"that try men's souls."

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.436
And they're trying ours now.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.636
This is a fateful moment
in the history of the West.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.660
We've seen divisive elections
and divided societies.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.060
We've seen a growth of extremism

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.980
in politics and religion,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.100
all of it fueled by anxiety,
uncertainty and fear,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.276
of a world that's changing
almost faster than we can bear,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.660
and the sure knowledge
that it's going to change faster still.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.716
I have a friend in Washington.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.916
I asked him, what was it like
being in America

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.180
during the recent presidential election?

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.900
He said to me, "Well,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.700
it was like the man

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.580
sitting on the deck of the Titanic

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.116
with a glass of whiskey in his hand

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.916
and he's saying,
'I know I asked for ice --

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.020
(Laughter)

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.260
but this is ridiculous.'"

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.796
So is there something we can do,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.020
each of us,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.036
to be able to face
the future without fear?

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.380
I think there is.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.796
And one way into it is to see

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.716
that perhaps the most simple way
into a culture and into an age

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.716
is to ask: What do people worship?

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.236
People have worshipped
so many different things --

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.140
the sun, the stars, the storm.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.060
Some people worship many gods,
some one, some none.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.740
In the 19th and 20th centuries,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.716
people worshipped the nation,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.196
the Aryan race, the communist state.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.220
What do we worship?

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.196
I think future anthropologists

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.300
will take a look at the books we read

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.236
on self-help, self-realization,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.460
self-esteem.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.036
They'll look at the way
we talk about morality

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.236
as being true to oneself,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.676
the way we talk about politics

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.476
as a matter of individual rights,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.836
and they'll look at this wonderful
new religious ritual we have created.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.060
You know the one?

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.300
Called the "selfie."

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.876
And I think they'll conclude
that what we worship in our time

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.660
is the self, the me, the I.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.700
And this is great.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.140
It's liberating.
It's empowering. It's wonderful.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.996
But don't forget that biologically,
we're social animals.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.636
We've spent most
of our evolutionary history

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.900
in small groups.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.236
We need those face-to-face interactions

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.660
where we learn
the choreography of altruism

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.756
and where we create those spiritual goods

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.180
like friendship and trust
and loyalty and love

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.540
that redeem our solitude.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.540
When we have too much of the "I"
and too little of the "we,"

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.420
we can find ourselves vulnerable,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.220
fearful and alone.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.876
It was no accident
that Sherry Turkle of MIT

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.996
called the book she wrote
on the impact of social media

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.140
"Alone Together."

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.236
So I think the simplest way
of safeguarding the future "you"

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.316
is to strengthen the future "us"

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.596
in three dimensions:

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.636
the us of relationship,

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.100
the us of identity

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.676
and the us of responsibility.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.276
So let me first
take the us of relationship.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.820
And here, forgive me if I get personal.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.700
Once upon a time,

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.076
a very long time ago,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.756
I was a 20-year-old undergraduate

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.436
studying philosophy.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.316
I was into Nietzsche and Schopenhauer
and Sartre and Camus.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.716
I was full of ontological uncertainty

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.276
and existential angst.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.076
It was terrific.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.876
(Laughter)

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.116
I was self-obsessed
and thoroughly unpleasant to know,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.820
until one day I saw

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.875
across the courtyard

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:31.276
a girl

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.876
who was everything that I wasn't.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.916
She radiated sunshine.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.060
She emanated joy.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.396
I found out her name was Elaine.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.876
We met. We talked.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.316
We married.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.676
And 47 years, three children
and eight grandchildren later,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.236
I can safely say

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.196
it was the best decision
I ever took in my life,

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.836
because it's the people not like us

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.060
that make us grow.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.540
And that is why I think

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.940
we have to do just that.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.956
The trouble with Google filters,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.916
Facebook friends

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.676
and reading the news by narrowcasting
rather than broadcasting

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.516
means that we're surrounded
almost entirely by people like us

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.036
whose views, whose opinions,
whose prejudices, even,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.380
are just like ours.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.716
And Cass Sunstein of Harvard has shown

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.116
that if we surround ourselves
with people with the same views as us,

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.460
we get more extreme.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.036
I think we need to renew
those face-to-face encounters

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.980
with the people not like us.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.196
I think we need to do that

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.276
in order to realize
that we can disagree strongly

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.596
and yet still stay friends.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.716
It's in those face-to-face encounters

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.740
that we discover
that the people not like us

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.220
are just people, like us.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.660
And actually, every time

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.756
we hold out the hand of friendship

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.796
to somebody not like us,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.780
whose class or creed
or color are different from ours,

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.556
we heal

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.196
one of the fractures

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.996
of our wounded world.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.420
That is the us of relationship.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.380
Second is the us of identity.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.300
Let me give you a thought experiment.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.756
Have you been to Washington?
Have you seen the memorials?

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.476
Absolutely fascinating.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.116
There's the Lincoln Memorial:

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.556
Gettysburg Address on one side,
Second Inaugural on the other.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.316
You go to the Jefferson Memorial,

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.276
screeds of text.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.316
Martin Luther King Memorial,

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.756
more than a dozen quotes
from his speeches.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.020
I didn't realize,
in America you read memorials.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.516
Now go to the equivalent
in London in Parliament Square

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.916
and you will see that the monument
to David Lloyd George

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.956
contains three words:

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.116
David Lloyd George.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.356
(Laughter)

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.156
Nelson Mandela gets two.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.516
Churchill gets just one:

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.756
Churchill.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.076
(Laughter)

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.596
Why the difference?
I'll tell you why the difference.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.916
Because America was from the outset
a nation of wave after wave of immigrants,

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.116
so it had to create an identity

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.476
which it did by telling a story

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.156
which you learned at school,
you read on memorials

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.036
and you heard repeated
in presidential inaugural addresses.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.116
Britain until recently
wasn't a nation of immigrants,

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.596
so it could take identity for granted.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.540
The trouble is now

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.356
that two things have happened
which shouldn't have happened together.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.676
The first thing is in the West
we've stopped telling this story

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.236
of who we are and why,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.500
even in America.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.836
And at the same time,

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.716
immigration is higher
than it's ever been before.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.036
So when you tell a story
and your identity is strong,

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.196
you can welcome the stranger,

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.716
but when you stop telling the story,

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.276
your identity gets weak

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.796
and you feel threatened by the stranger.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.396
And that's bad.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:16.716
I tell you, Jews have been scattered
and dispersed and exiled for 2,000 years.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.436
We never lost our identity.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.556
Why? Because at least once a year,

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.316
on the festival of Passover,

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.276
we told our story
and we taught it to our children

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.556
and we ate the unleavened
bread of affliction

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.996
and tasted the bitter herbs of slavery.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.076
So we never lost our identity.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.796
I think collectively

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.676
we've got to get back
to telling our story,

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.716
who we are, where we came from,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.860
what ideals by which we live.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.076
And if that happens,

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.516
we will become strong enough

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.196
to welcome the stranger and say,

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.316
"Come and share our lives,

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.820
share our stories,

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.140
share our aspirations and dreams."

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.596
That is the us of identity.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.940
And finally, the us of responsibility.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.916
Do you know something?

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.556
My favorite phrase in all of politics,

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.060
very American phrase,

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.660
is: "We the people."

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.156
Why "we the people?"

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.380
Because it says that we all
share collective responsibility

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.980
for our collective future.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.500
And that's how things
really are and should be.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.076
Have you noticed how magical thinking

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.020
has taken over our politics?

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:40.476
So we say, all you've got to do
is elect this strong leader

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.700
and he or she will solve
all our problems for us.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.660
Believe me, that is magical thinking.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.796
And then we get the extremes:

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.620
the far right, the far left,

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.436
the extreme religious
and the extreme anti-religious,

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.396
the far right dreaming
of a golden age that never was,

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:09.196
the far left dreaming
of a utopia that never will be

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.236
and the religious and anti-religious
equally convinced

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.596
that all it takes is God
or the absence of God

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.940
to save us from ourselves.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.756
That, too, is magical thinking,

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.436
because the only people
who will save us from ourselves

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.836
is we the people,

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.180
all of us together.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.660
And when we do that,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.036
and when we move from the politics of me

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.436
to the politics of all of us together,

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:49.260
we rediscover those beautiful,
counterintuitive truths:

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.660
that a nation is strong

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.220
when it cares for the weak,

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.876
that it becomes rich

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.036
when it cares for the poor,

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.676
it becomes invulnerable
when it cares about the vulnerable.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.116
That is what makes great nations.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.700
(Applause)

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.740
So here is my simple suggestion.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.780
It might just change your life,

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.380
and it might just help
to begin to change the world.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.156
Do a search and replace operation

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.916
on the text of your mind,

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.036
and wherever you encounter
the word "self,"

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.420
substitute the word "other."

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.476
So instead of self-help, other-help;

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.060
instead of self-esteem, other-esteem.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.036
And if you do that,

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.980
you will begin to feel the power

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.676
of what for me is one
of the most moving sentences

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.260
in all of religious literature.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.100
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.316
I will fear no evil,

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.380
for you are with me."

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.756
We can face any future without fear

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.516
so long as we know

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.260
we will not face it alone.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.260
So for the sake of the future "you,"

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.836
together let us strengthen

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.380
the future "us."

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.356
Thank you.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.980
(Applause)
