00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.916
So what if I could make for you

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.420
a designer baby?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.236
What if you as a parent-to-be

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and I as a scientist decided
to go down that road together?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.116
What if we didn't?

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.916
What if we thought, "That's a bad idea,"

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.316
but many of our family,
friends and coworkers

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.980
did make that decision?

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.340
Let's fast-forward just 15 years from now.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.556
Let's pretend it's the year 2030,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.979
and you're a parent.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.796
You have your daughter,
Marianne, next to you,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.196
and in 2030, she is what we call a natural

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.740
because she has no genetic modifications.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.540
And because you and your partner
consciously made that decision,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.516
many in your social circle,
they kind of look down on you.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.340
They think you're, like,
a Luddite or a technophobe.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.316
Marianne's best friend Jenna,
who lives right next door,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.860
is a very different story.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.620
She was born a genetically modified
designer baby with numerous upgrades.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.900
Yeah. Upgrades.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.596
And these enhancements were introduced

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.156
using a new genetic
modification technology

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.956
that goes by the funny name CRISPR,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.676
you know, like something's crisp,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.020
this is CRISPR.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.636
The scientist that Jenna's parents
hired to do this

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.540
for several million dollars

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.260
introduced CRISPR
into a whole panel of human embryos.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.876
And then they used genetic testing,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.956
and they predicted that
that little tiny embryo, Jenna's embryo,

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.900
would be the best of the bunch.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.436
And now, Jenna is an actual, real person.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.676
She's sitting on the carpet
in your living room

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.180
playing with your daughter Marianne.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.996
And your families have known
each other for years now,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.436
and it's become very clear to you

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.340
that Jenna is extraordinary.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.036
She's incredibly intelligent.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.316
If you're honest with yourself,
she's smarter than you,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.900
and she's five years old.

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.756
She's beautiful, tall, athletic,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.260
and the list goes on and on.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.676
And in fact, there's
a whole new generation

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.940
of these GM kids like Jenna.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.876
And so far it looks like

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.236
they're healthier
than their parents' generation,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.996
than your generation.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.020
And they have lower health care costs.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.596
They're immune to a host
of health conditions,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.860
including HIV/AIDS and genetic diseases.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.580
It all sounds so great,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.316
but you can't help but have
this sort of unsettling feeling,

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.340
a gut feeling, that there's something
just not quite right about Jenna,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.100
and you've had the same feeling
about other GM kids that you've met.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.316
You were also reading
in the newspaper earlier this week

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.276
that a study of these children
who were born as designer babies

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.156
indicates they may have some issues,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.860
like increased aggressiveness
and narcissism.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.116
But more immediately on your mind

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.836
is some news that you just got
from Jenna's family.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.356
She's so smart,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.476
she's now going to be going
to a special school,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.996
a different school
than your daughter Marianne,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.756
and this is kind of throwing
your family into a disarray.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.116
Marianne's been crying,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.556
and last night when you took her to bed
to kiss her goodnight,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.060
she said, "Daddy, will Jenna
even be my friend anymore?"

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.836
So now, as I've been telling you
this imagined 2030 story,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.476
I have a feeling
that I may have put some of you

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.076
into this sci-fi
frame of reference. Right?

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.596
You think you're reading a sci-fi book.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.556
Or maybe, like,
in Halloween mode of thinking.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.996
But this is really
a possible reality for us,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.660
just 15 years from now.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.236
I'm a stem cell and genetics researcher

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.196
and I can see this new CRISPR technology

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.940
and its potential impact.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.036
And we may find ourselves in that reality,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.140
and a lot will depend
on what we decide to do today.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.276
And if you're still
kind of thinking in sci-fi mode,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.796
consider that the world of science
had a huge shock earlier this year,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.755
and the public largely
doesn't even know about it.

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.556
Researchers in China just a few months ago

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.236
reported the creation
of genetically modified human embryos.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.796
This was the first time in history.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.500
And they did it using
this new CRISPR technology.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.116
It didn't work perfectly,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.716
but I still think
they sort of cracked the door ajar

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.540
on a Pandora's box here.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.196
And I think some people
are going to run with this technology

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.100
and try to make designer babies.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.076
Now, before I go on, some of you
may hold up your hands and say,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.356
"Stop, Paul, wait a minute.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.196
Wouldn't that be illegal?

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.860
You can't just go off
and create a designer baby."

00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:15.476
And in fact, to some extent, you're right.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.820
In some countries, you couldn't do that.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.596
But in many other countries,
including my country, the US,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.500
there's actually no law on this,
so in theory, you could do it.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.956
And there was another development
this year that resonates in this area,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.780
and that happened
not so far from here over in the UK.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.396
And the UK traditionally
has been the strictest country

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.236
when it comes to human
genetic modification.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.196
It was illegal there,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.796
but just a few months ago,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.276
they carved out an exception to that rule.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.836
They passed a new law

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.316
allowing the creation
of genetically modified humans

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.460
with the noble goal of trying
to prevent a rare kind of genetic disease.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.916
But still I think in combination
these events are pushing us

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.476
further towards an acceptance

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.420
of human genetic modification.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.556
So I've been talking
about this CRISPR technology.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.620
What actually is CRISPR?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.516
So if you think about the GMOs
that we're all more familiar with,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.756
like GMO tomatoes and wheat

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.716
and things like that,

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.356
this technology
is similar to the technologies

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.236
that were used to make those,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.636
but it's dramatically better,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.620
cheaper and faster.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.476
So what is it?

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.956
It's actually like
a genetic Swiss army knife.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.236
We can pretend this is a Swiss army knife

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.596
with different tools in it,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.756
and one of the tools
is kind of like a magnifying glass

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.220
or a GPS for our DNA,

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.276
so it can home in on a certain spot.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.956
And the next tool is like scissors

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.236
that can cut the DNA right in that spot.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.836
And finally we have a pen

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.356
where we can literally rewrite
the genetic code in that location.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.620
It's really that simple.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.156
And this technology, which came
on the scene just three years ago,

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.020
has taken science by storm.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.076
It's evolving so fast, and it's
so freaking exciting to scientists,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.900
and I admit I'm fascinated by it
and we use it in my own lab,

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.436
that I think someone
is going to go that extra step

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.036
and continue the GM human embryo work

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.460
and maybe make designer babies.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.556
This is so ubiquitous now.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.996
It just came on the scene three years ago.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.356
Thousands of labs
literally have this in hand today,

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.756
and they're doing important research.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.396
Most of them are not interested
in designer babies.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.916
They're studying human disease

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.356
and other important elements of science.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.980
So there's a lot of good research
going on with CRISPR.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.236
And the fact that we can
now do genetic modifications

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.036
that used to take years
and cost millions of dollars

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.076
in a few weeks
for a couple thousand bucks,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.236
to me as a scientist that's fantastic,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.396
but again, at the same time,

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.540
it opens the door to people going too far.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.556
And I think for some people

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.596
the focus is not going to be
so much on science.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.636
That's not what's going
to be driving them.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.180
It's going to be ideology
or the chase for a profit.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.500
And they're going to go
for designer babies.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.916
So why should we be concerned about this?

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.156
We know from Darwin,
if we go back two centuries,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.316
that evolution and genetics
profoundly have impacted humanity,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.476
who we are today.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.436
And some think there's like
a social Darwinism at work in our world,

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.940
and maybe even a eugenics as well.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.276
Imagine those trends, those forces,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.276
with a booster rocket
of this CRISPR technology

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.020
that is so powerful and so ubiquitous.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.715
And in fact, we can just go back
one century to the last century

00:08:54.739 --> 00:08:57.740
to see the power that eugenics can have.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.076
So my father, Peter Knoepfler,

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.876
was actually born right here in Vienna.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.396
He was Viennese,
and he was born here in 1929.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.316
And when my grandparents
had little baby Peter,

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.076
the world was very different. Right?

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.396
It was a different Vienna.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.996
The United States was different.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.276
The world was different.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.596
There was a eugenics rising,

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.956
and my grandparents realized,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.396
pretty quickly I think,

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.940
that they were on the wrong side
of the eugenics equation.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.036
And so despite this being their home

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.116
and their whole extended family's home,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.476
and this area being their family's
home for generations,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.516
they decided because of eugenics

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.780
that they had to leave.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.636
And they survived,
but they were heartbroken,

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.796
and I'm not sure my dad
ever really got over leaving Vienna.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.156
He left when he was just eight years old

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.380
in 1938.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.436
So today, I see a new eugenics

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.796
kind of bubbling to the surface.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.796
It's supposed to be a kinder,
gentler, positive eugenics,

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.140
different than all that past stuff.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:12.396
But I think even though it's focused
on trying to improve people,

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.116
it could have negative consequences,

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.396
and it really worries me

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.196
that some of the top proponents
of this new eugenics,

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.780
they think CRISPR is the ticket
to make it happen.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.916
So I have to admit, you know,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.196
eugenics, we talk
about making better people.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.476
It's a tough question.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.420
What is better when we're talking
about a human being?

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.836
But I admit I think maybe a lot of us

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.796
could agree that human beings,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.796
maybe we could use a little betterment.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.116
Look at our politicians

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.196
here, you know, back in the US --

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.836
God forbid we go there right now.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.836
Maybe even if we just look in the mirror,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.396
there might be ways
we think we could be better.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.236
I might wish, honestly, that I had
more hair here, instead of baldness.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.796
Some people might wish they were taller,

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.660
have a different weight, a different face.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.156
If we could do those things,
we could make those things happen,

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.436
or we could make them happen
in our children,

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.260
it would be very seductive.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.756
And yet coming with it
would be these risks.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.676
I talked about eugenics,

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.516
but there would be risks
to individuals as well.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.996
So if we forget about enhancing people

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.476
and we just try to make them
healthier using genetic modification,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.956
this technology is so new

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.556
and so powerful,

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.340
that by accident
we could make them sicker.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.476
That easily could happen.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.756
And there's another risk,

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.356
and that is that all of the legitimate,
important genetic modification research

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.036
going on just in the lab --

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.076
again, no interest in designer babies --

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.956
a few people going
the designer baby route,

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.356
things go badly,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.340
that entire field could be damaged.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.716
I also think it's not that unlikely

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.020
that governments might start taking
an interest in genetic modification.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:09.636
So for example our imagined GM Jenna child

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.876
who is healthier,

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.916
if there's a generation that looks
like they have lower health care costs,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.156
it's possible that governments
may start trying to compel their citizens

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.076
to go the GM route.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.116
Look at China's one-child policy.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:28.860
It's thought that that prevented
the birth of 400 million human beings.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.796
So it's not beyond the realm of possible

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.076
that genetic modification
could be something that governments push.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.596
And if designer babies become popular,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.436
in our digital age --

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.116
viral videos, social media --

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.716
what if designer babies
are thought to be fashionable,

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.876
and they kind of become
the new glitterati,

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.636
the new Kardashians or something?

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.676
(Laughter)

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.236
You know, are those trends
that we really could control?

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.340
I'm not convinced that we could.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.636
So again, today it's Halloween

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.116
and when we talk
about genetic modification,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.276
there's one Halloween-associated character

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.956
that is talked about
or invoked more than anything else,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.820
and that is Frankenstein.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.836
Mostly that's been Frankenfoods
and all this other stuff.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.436
But if we think about this now
and we think about it in the human context

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.716
on a day like Halloween,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:30.156
if parents can in essence
costume their children genetically,

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.940
are we going to be talking about
a Frankenstein 2.0 kind of situation?

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.236
I don't think so. I don't think
it's going to get to that extreme.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.236
But when we are going about
hacking the human code,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.516
I think all bets are off
in terms of what might come of that.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.180
There would still be dangers.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.876
And we can look in the past

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.516
to other elements
of transformative science

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.356
and see how they can
basically go out of control

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.940
and permeate society.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.180
So I'll just give you one example,
and that is in vitro fertilization.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.916
Almost exactly 40 years ago,

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.636
test tube baby number one
Louise Brown was born,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.916
and that's a great thing,

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:18.476
and I think since then
five million IVF babies have been born,

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.156
bringing immeasurable happiness.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.316
A lot of parents now can love those kids.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.396
But if you think about it,
in four decades,

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.316
five million babies being born
from a new technology

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.156
is pretty remarkable,

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.396
and the same kind of thing could happen

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.996
with human genetic modification
and designer babies.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.196
So depending on the decisions
we make in the next few months,

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.516
the next year or so,

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.676
if designer baby number one is born,

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.916
within a few decades,

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.596
there could well be millions
of genetically modified humans.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.076
And there's a difference there too,
because if we, you in the audience, or I,

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.996
if we decide to have a designer baby,

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.036
then their children will also
be genetically modified, and so on,

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.356
because it's heritable.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.860
So that's a big difference.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.316
So with all of this in mind,

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.900
what should we do?

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.756
There's actually going to be a meeting

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.676
a month from tomorrow in Washington, D.C.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.636
by the US National Academy of Sciences

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.276
to tackle that exact question.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.980
What is the right path forward
with human genetic modification?

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.236
I believe at this time

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.716
we need a moratorium.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.236
We have to ban this.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.836
We should not allow
creating genetically modified people,

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.180
because it's just too dangerous
and too unpredictable.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.636
But there's a lot of people --

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.796
(Applause)

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.036
Thanks.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.460
(Applause)

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.996
And let me say, just as a scientist,

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.516
it's a little bit scary
for me to say that in public,

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.780
because science generally doesn't like
self-regulation and things like that.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.196
So I think we need to put a hold on this,

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.956
but there are many people
who not only disagree with me,

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.476
they feel the exact opposite.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.836
They're like, step on the gas,
full speed ahead,

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.476
let's make designer babies.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.436
And so in the meeting in December

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.916
and other meetings that are likely
to follow in the next few months,

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.076
it's very possible
there may be no moratorium.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.156
And I think part
of the problem that we have

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.236
is that all of this trend,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.356
this revolution in genetic modification
applying to humans,

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.996
the public hasn't known about it.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.836
Nobody has been saying,

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.916
look, this is a big deal,
this is a revolution,

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.196
and this could affect you
in very personal ways.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.036
And so part of my goal
is actually to change that

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.996
and to educate and engage with the public

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.820
and get you guys talking about this.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.116
And so I hope at these meetings
that there will be a role for the public

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.660
to bring their voice to bear as well.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.060
So if we kind of circle back now
to 2030 again, that imagined story,

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.036
and depending on the decisions
we make, again, today --

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.996
literally we don't have a lot of time --

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.116
in the next few months,
the next year or so,

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.660
because this technology
is spreading like wildfire.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.316
Let's pretend we're back in that reality.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.156
We're at a park,

00:17:18.179 --> 00:17:21.460
and our kid is swinging on the swing.

00:17:22.419 --> 00:17:25.035
Is that kid a regular old kid,

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.515
or did we decide to have a designer baby?

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.995
And let's say we went
the sort of traditional route,

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.515
and there's our kid swinging on the swing,

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.356
and frankly, they're kind of a mess.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.076
Their hair is all over
the place like mine.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.316
They have a stuffy nose.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.380
They're not the best student in the world.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.276
They're adorable, you love them,

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.236
but there on the swing next to them,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.276
their best friend is a GM kid,

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.716
and the two of them
are kind of swinging like this,

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.756
and you can't help
but compare them, right?

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.276
And the GM kid is swinging higher,

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.476
they look better,
they're a better student,

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.476
they don't have that stuffy nose
you need to wipe.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.756
How is that going to make you feel

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.500
and what decision
might you make next time?

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.876
Thank you.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:17.817
(Applause)
