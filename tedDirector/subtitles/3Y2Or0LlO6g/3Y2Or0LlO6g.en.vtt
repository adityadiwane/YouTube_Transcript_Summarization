00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.808
You may have heard
about the Koran's idea of paradise

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:22.111
being 72 virgins,

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:25.088
and I promise I will come back
to those virgins.

00:00:25.112 --> 00:00:28.066
But in fact, here in the Northwest,
we're living very close

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.693
to the real Koranic idea of paradise,

00:00:30.717 --> 00:00:36.362
defined 36 times as "gardens
watered by running streams."

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.397
Since I live on a houseboat
on the running stream of Lake Union,

00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:43.643
this makes perfect sense to me.

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:46.667
But the thing is, how come
it's news to most people?

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:50.136
I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.827
who've begun reading
the Koran, but given up,

00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:55.380
disconcerted by its "otherness."

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:58.900
The historian Thomas Carlyle
considered Muhammad

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:00.900
one of the world's greatest heroes,

00:01:00.924 --> 00:01:03.336
yet even he called the Koran

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.726
"as toilsome reading as I ever undertook;
a wearisome, confused jumble."

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.026
(Laughter)

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.056
Part of the problem,
I think, is that we imagine

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.736
that the Koran can be read
as we usually read a book --

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.736
as though we can curl up
with it on a rainy afternoon

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.736
with a bowl of popcorn within reach,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.280
as though God --

00:01:24.304 --> 00:01:28.046
and the Koran is entirely in the voice
of God speaking to Muhammad --

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.864
were just another author
on the best-seller list.

00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:36.988
Yet, the fact that so few people
do actually read the Koran

00:01:37.012 --> 00:01:42.274
is precisely why it's so easy to quote --
that is, to misquote.

00:01:42.298 --> 00:01:43.322
(Laughter)

00:01:43.346 --> 00:01:45.736
Phrases and snippets taken out of context

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.836
in what I call the "highlighter version,"

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.947
which is the one favored
by both Muslim fundamentalists

00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:53.736
and anti-Muslim Islamophobes.

00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:56.082
So this past spring,

00:01:56.106 --> 00:02:00.168
as I was gearing up to begin writing
a biography of Muhammad,

00:02:00.192 --> 00:02:04.426
I realized I needed to read
the Koran properly --

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.212
as properly as I could, that is.

00:02:07.236 --> 00:02:10.346
My Arabic is reduced by now
to wielding a dictionary,

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.736
so I took four well-known translations

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.925
and decided to read them
side by side, verse by verse,

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:21.818
along with a transliteration
and the original seventh-century Arabic.

00:02:24.072 --> 00:02:26.760
Now, I did have an advantage.

00:02:27.743 --> 00:02:32.411
My last book was about the story
behind the Shi'a-Sunni split,

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:35.848
and for that, I'd worked closely
with the earliest Islamic histories,

00:02:35.872 --> 00:02:39.634
so I knew the events
to which the Koran constantly refers,

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:41.635
its frame of reference.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.736
I knew enough, that is, to know
that I'd be a tourist in the Koran --

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.736
an informed one,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.235
an experienced one, even,

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.608
but still an outsider,

00:02:52.632 --> 00:02:56.454
an agnostic Jew reading
someone else's holy book.

00:02:56.478 --> 00:02:58.553
(Laughter)

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:00.147
So I read slowly.

00:03:00.171 --> 00:03:04.656
(Laughter)

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.167
I'd set aside three weeks
for this project,

00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:10.061
and that, I think,
is what is meant by "hubris" --

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:14.371
(Laughter)

00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:16.571
because it turned out to be three months.

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:18.482
(Laughter)

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:21.004
I did resist the temptation
to skip to the back,

00:03:21.028 --> 00:03:24.195
where the shorter and more
clearly mystical chapters are.

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.736
But every time I thought I was beginning
to get a handle on the Koran --

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.042
that feeling of "I get it now" --

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:32.129
it would slip away overnight,

00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:33.807
and I'd come back in the morning,

00:03:33.831 --> 00:03:36.559
wondering if I wasn't lost
in a strange land.

00:03:37.298 --> 00:03:39.815
And yet, the terrain was very familiar.

00:03:40.577 --> 00:03:43.440
The Koran declares that it comes
to renew the message

00:03:43.464 --> 00:03:44.897
of the Torah and the Gospels.

00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:48.409
So one-third of it reprises
the stories of Biblical figures

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:52.962
like Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus.

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:56.645
God himself was utterly familiar

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.736
from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.760
jealously insisting on no other gods.

00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:08.962
The presence of camels, mountains,
desert wells and springs

00:04:08.986 --> 00:04:12.417
took me back to the year I spent
wandering the Sinai Desert.

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:16.736
And then there was the language,
the rhythmic cadence of it,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.981
reminding me of evenings spent
listening to Bedouin elders

00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:22.982
recite hours-long narrative poems

00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:24.873
entirely from memory.

00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:30.790
And I began to grasp why it's said

00:04:30.814 --> 00:04:34.926
that the Koran is really
the Koran only in Arabic.

00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:39.687
Take the Fatihah,
the seven-verse opening chapter

00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:43.711
that is the Lord's Prayer
and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.297
It's just 29 words in Arabic,

00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:51.162
but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation.

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:54.953
And yet the more you add,
the more seems to go missing.

00:04:56.127 --> 00:05:00.736
The Arabic has an incantatory,
almost hypnotic quality

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.018
that begs to be heard rather than read,

00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:05.812
felt more than analyzed.

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:08.564
It wants to be chanted out loud,

00:05:08.588 --> 00:05:11.372
to sound its music in the ear
and on the tongue.

00:05:12.015 --> 00:05:16.736
So the Koran in English
is a kind of shadow of itself,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.591
or as Arthur Arberry called his version,

00:05:19.615 --> 00:05:20.963
"an interpretation."

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.306
But all is not lost in translation.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.736
As the Koran promises,
patience is rewarded,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.309
and there are many surprises --

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:33.489
a degree of environmental
awareness, for instance,

00:05:33.513 --> 00:05:37.082
and of humans as mere stewards
of God's creation,

00:05:37.106 --> 00:05:38.740
unmatched in the Bible.

00:05:39.609 --> 00:05:42.486
And where the Bible is addressed
exclusively to men,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.136
using the second-
and third-person masculine,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.736
the Koran includes women --

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.184
talking, for instance,

00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:51.632
of believing men and believing women,

00:05:51.656 --> 00:05:54.844
honorable men and honorable women.

00:05:56.244 --> 00:06:00.221
Or take the infamous verse
about killing the unbelievers.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:02.736
Yes, it does say that,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.486
but in a very specific context:

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.847
the anticipated conquest
of the sanctuary city of Mecca,

00:06:09.871 --> 00:06:12.395
where fighting was usually forbidden.

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.942
And the permission comes
hedged about with qualifiers.

00:06:15.966 --> 00:06:18.736
Not "You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,"

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.999
but you can, you are allowed to,

00:06:21.023 --> 00:06:25.394
but only after a grace period is over,

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:28.276
and only if there's no other
pact in place,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.736
and only if they try to stop
you getting to the Kaaba,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.476
and only if they attack you first.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.105
And even then -- God is merciful;

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:40.158
forgiveness is supreme --

00:06:40.182 --> 00:06:42.900
and so, essentially,

00:06:42.924 --> 00:06:44.377
better if you don't.

00:06:44.401 --> 00:06:47.843
(Laughter)

00:06:47.867 --> 00:06:50.630
This was perhaps the biggest surprise --

00:06:50.654 --> 00:06:52.736
how flexible the Koran is,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.445
at least in minds that are not
fundamentally inflexible.

00:06:57.656 --> 00:07:01.303
"Some of these verses
are definite in meaning," it says,

00:07:01.327 --> 00:07:03.196
"and others are ambiguous."

00:07:04.141 --> 00:07:07.943
The perverse at heart
will seek out the ambiguities,

00:07:07.967 --> 00:07:12.596
trying to create discord
by pinning down meanings of their own.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.910
Only God knows the true meaning.

00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:20.253
The phrase "God is subtle"
appears again and again,

00:07:20.277 --> 00:07:22.879
and indeed, the whole
of the Koran is far more subtle

00:07:22.903 --> 00:07:25.407
than most of us have been led to believe.

00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:30.499
As in, for instance, that little matter
of virgins and paradise.

00:07:31.704 --> 00:07:34.875
Old-fashioned orientalism
comes into play here.

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:40.429
The word used four times is "houris,"

00:07:40.453 --> 00:07:44.910
rendered as dark-eyed maidens
with swelling breasts,

00:07:44.934 --> 00:07:48.127
or as fair, high-bosomed virgins.

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:53.760
Yet all there is in the original Arabic
is that one word: houris.

00:07:54.505 --> 00:07:57.009
Not a swelling breast
or high bosom in sight.

00:07:57.033 --> 00:07:59.537
(Laughter)

00:07:59.561 --> 00:08:04.118
Now this may be a way of saying
"pure beings," like in angels,

00:08:04.142 --> 00:08:07.155
or it may be like
the Greek "kouros" or "kore,"

00:08:07.179 --> 00:08:08.521
an eternal youth.

00:08:08.545 --> 00:08:11.281
But the truth is, nobody really knows.

00:08:11.305 --> 00:08:12.549
And that's the point.

00:08:13.466 --> 00:08:15.882
Because the Koran is quite clear

00:08:15.906 --> 00:08:20.736
when it says that you'll be
"a new creation in paradise,"

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.889
and that you will be "recreated
in a form unknown to you,"

00:08:25.913 --> 00:08:28.448
which seems to me
a far more appealing prospect

00:08:28.472 --> 00:08:30.051
than a virgin.

00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:37.047
(Laughter)

00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:41.563
And that number 72 never appears.

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:45.253
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran.

00:08:45.277 --> 00:08:48.522
That idea only came
into being 300 years later,

00:08:48.546 --> 00:08:51.523
and most Islamic scholars
see it as the equivalent

00:08:51.547 --> 00:08:55.149
of people with wings sitting on clouds
and strumming harps.

00:08:56.593 --> 00:08:59.238
Paradise is quite the opposite.

00:09:00.111 --> 00:09:01.874
It's not virginity;

00:09:01.898 --> 00:09:03.382
it's fecundity;

00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:05.464
it's plenty.

00:09:06.107 --> 00:09:09.865
It's gardens watered by running streams.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.672
Thank you.

00:09:12.696 --> 00:09:19.673
(Applause)
