00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:16.270
Guys, we have an issue.

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:17.392
(Laughter)

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:20.210
Growth is fading away,
and it's a big deal.

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:23.292
Our global economy stops growing.

00:00:24.018 --> 00:00:25.417
And it's not new.

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:28.752
Growth has actually declined
for the last 50 years.

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:31.753
If we continue like this, we need to learn

00:00:31.777 --> 00:00:35.502
how to live in a world
with no growth in the next decade.

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:39.726
This is scary because
when the economy doesn't grow,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.710
our children don't get better lives.

00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:45.948
What's even scarier is that
when the pie does not grow,

00:00:45.972 --> 00:00:47.528
each of us get a smaller piece.

00:00:47.552 --> 00:00:49.667
We're then ready to fight
for a bigger one.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.210
This creates tensions
and serious conflicts.

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:55.523
Growth matters a lot.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.638
If we look at the history of growth,

00:00:59.662 --> 00:01:02.174
times of big growth
have always been fueled

00:01:02.198 --> 00:01:04.223
by big manufacturing revolutions.

00:01:04.818 --> 00:01:07.724
It happened three times,
every 50-60 years.

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:12.443
The steam engine
in the middle of the 19th century,

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:16.228
the mass-production model
in the beginning of the 20th century --

00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:17.571
thanks, Mr. Ford.

00:01:18.384 --> 00:01:21.368
And the first automation
wave in the 1970s.

00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:24.353
Why did these manufacturing revolutions

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:26.602
create huge growth in our economies?

00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:30.791
Because they have injected
huge productivity improvement.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.741
It's rather simple:

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.315
in order to grow,
you need to be producing more,

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:38.307
putting more into our economy.

00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:44.853
This means either more labor
or more capital or more productivity.

00:01:44.877 --> 00:01:47.892
Each time, productivity
has been the growth lever.

00:01:49.744 --> 00:01:52.487
I'm here today to tell you

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:56.221
that we are on the verge
of another huge change,

00:01:56.245 --> 00:01:59.707
and that this change, surprisingly enough,

00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:02.401
is going to come
from manufacturing, again.

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:06.502
It will get us out of our growth slump

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:10.370
and it will change radically
the way globalization has been shaped

00:02:10.394 --> 00:02:11.635
over the last decade.

00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:17.206
I'm here to tell you about the amazing
fourth manufacturing revolution

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.642
that is currently underway.

00:02:19.213 --> 00:02:21.674
It's not as if we've done nothing
with manufacturing

00:02:21.698 --> 00:02:22.987
since the last revolution.

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:25.426
Actually, we've made
some pretty lame attempts

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.051
to try to revitalize it.

00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:30.052
But none of them
have been the big overhaul

00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:31.965
we really need to get us growing again.

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:36.978
For example, we've tried
to relocate our factories offshore

00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:40.025
in order to reduce cost
and take advantage of cheap labor.

00:02:41.048 --> 00:02:44.631
Not only did this not
inspire productivity,

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:47.127
but it only saved money
for a short period of time,

00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:49.690
because cheap labor
didn't stay cheap for long.

00:02:50.455 --> 00:02:54.377
Then, we've tried to make
our factories larger

00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:56.290
and we specialized them by product.

00:02:57.318 --> 00:03:00.631
The idea was that we can
make a lot of one product

00:03:00.655 --> 00:03:03.037
and stockpile it to be sold with demand.

00:03:04.022 --> 00:03:06.601
This did help productivity for a while.

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:10.546
But it introduced a lot of rigidities
in our supply chain.

00:03:11.432 --> 00:03:12.828
Let's take fashion retail.

00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:15.350
Traditional clothing companies

00:03:15.374 --> 00:03:20.021
have built offshore,
global, rigid supply chains.

00:03:20.787 --> 00:03:23.538
When fast-fashion competitors like Zara

00:03:23.562 --> 00:03:26.073
started replenishing their stocks faster

00:03:26.097 --> 00:03:29.776
from two collections a year
to one collection a month,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.344
none of them have been able
to keep up with the pace.

00:03:32.368 --> 00:03:35.078
Most of them are
in great difficulties today.

00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:39.212
Yet, with all of their shortcomings,

00:03:39.236 --> 00:03:41.181
those are the factories we know today.

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:43.157
When you open the doors,

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:46.087
they look the same
as they did 50 years ago.

00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:51.435
We've just changed the location,
the size, the way they operate.

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:54.617
Can you name anything else
that looks the same

00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:56.196
as it did 50 years ago?

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.375
It's crazy.

00:03:57.836 --> 00:04:00.868
We've made all the tweaks
to the model that we could,

00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:03.890
and now we hit its limits.

00:04:05.032 --> 00:04:09.869
After all of our attempts to fix
the manufacturing model failed,

00:04:09.893 --> 00:04:12.698
we thought growth could come
from elsewhere.

00:04:12.722 --> 00:04:14.762
We turned to the tech sector --

00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:17.154
there's been quite a lot
of innovations there.

00:04:17.178 --> 00:04:18.973
Just to name one: the Internet.

00:04:19.906 --> 00:04:21.711
We hoped it could produce growth.

00:04:21.735 --> 00:04:24.227
And indeed, it changed our lives.

00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:28.696
It made big waves in the media,
the service, the entertainment spaces.

00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:31.157
But it hasn't done much for productivity.

00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:36.307
Actually, what's surprising
is that productivity is on the decline

00:04:36.331 --> 00:04:38.860
despite all of those innovation efforts.

00:04:39.523 --> 00:04:43.281
Imagine that -- sitting at work,
scrolling through Facebook,

00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:47.109
watching videos on YouTube
has made us less productive.

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:48.284
Weird.

00:04:48.308 --> 00:04:49.892
(Laughter)

00:04:49.916 --> 00:04:51.697
This is why we are not growing.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.856
We failed at reinventing
the manufacturing space,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.830
and large technological innovations
have played away from it.

00:05:01.184 --> 00:05:03.458
But what if we could combine those forces?

00:05:03.927 --> 00:05:08.795
What if the existing manufacturing
and large technological innovation

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:13.382
came together to create
the next big manufacturing reinvention.

00:05:13.406 --> 00:05:14.664
Bingo!

00:05:14.688 --> 00:05:17.171
This is the fourth
manufacturing revolution,

00:05:17.195 --> 00:05:18.859
and it's happening right now.

00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:22.621
Major technologies are entering
the manufacturing space,

00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:23.795
big time.

00:05:24.316 --> 00:05:27.412
They will boost industrial productivity
by more than a third.

00:05:28.217 --> 00:05:31.943
This is massive, and it will do
a lot in creating growth.

00:05:33.286 --> 00:05:35.092
Let me tell you about some of them.

00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:38.990
Have you already met advanced
manufacturing robots?

00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:41.678
They are the size of humans,

00:05:41.702 --> 00:05:43.723
they actually collaborate with them,

00:05:43.747 --> 00:05:45.326
and they can be programmed

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.262
in order to perform
complex, non-repetitive tasks.

00:05:49.628 --> 00:05:54.566
Today in our factories, only
8 percent of the tasks are automated.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.855
The less complex,
the more repetitive ones.

00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.428
It will be 25 percent in 10 years.

00:06:01.452 --> 00:06:04.265
It means that by 2025,

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.853
advanced robots will complement workers

00:06:06.877 --> 00:06:09.720
to be, together,
20 percent more productive,

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.745
to manufacture 20 percent more outputs,

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:13.886
to achieve 20 percent additional growth.

00:06:15.118 --> 00:06:18.042
This isn't some fancy, futuristic idea.

00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:21.002
These robots are working for us right now.

00:06:21.993 --> 00:06:27.539
Last year in the US, they helped
Amazon prepare and ship all the products

00:06:27.563 --> 00:06:29.657
required for Cyber Monday,

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.703
the annual peak of online retail.

00:06:32.401 --> 00:06:34.025
Last year in the US,

00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:39.947
it was the biggest online shopping day
of the year and of history.

00:06:40.626 --> 00:06:44.252
Consumers spent 3 billion dollars
on electronics that day.

00:06:44.276 --> 00:06:46.791
That's real economic growth.

00:06:47.502 --> 00:06:51.550
Then there's additive
manufacturing, 3D printing.

00:06:51.574 --> 00:06:55.582
3D printing has already improved
plastic manufacturing

00:06:55.606 --> 00:06:58.590
and it's now making its way through metal.

00:06:58.614 --> 00:07:00.199
Those are not small industries.

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:03.891
Plastic and metals represent 25 percent

00:07:03.915 --> 00:07:05.915
of global manufacturing production.

00:07:06.717 --> 00:07:08.266
Let's take a real example.

00:07:09.005 --> 00:07:11.943
In the aerospace industry,

00:07:11.967 --> 00:07:16.460
fuel nozzles are some of the most
complex parts to manufacture,

00:07:16.484 --> 00:07:17.782
for one reason:

00:07:17.806 --> 00:07:20.995
they are made up of 20 different parts

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:23.830
that need to be separately produced

00:07:23.854 --> 00:07:26.479
and then painstakingly assembled.

00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:30.427
Aerospace companies
are now using 3D printing,

00:07:30.451 --> 00:07:33.515
which allows them to turn
those 20 different parts

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:34.849
into just one.

00:07:35.368 --> 00:07:36.518
The results?

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:39.245
40 percent more productivity,

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:42.536
40 percent more output produced,
40 percent more growth

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.105
for this specific industry.

00:07:45.283 --> 00:07:51.433
But actually, the most exciting part
of this new manufacturing revolution

00:07:51.457 --> 00:07:53.862
goes much beyond productivity.

00:07:54.692 --> 00:07:58.263
It's about producing better,
smarter products.

00:07:58.287 --> 00:08:00.701
It's about scale customization.

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:05.834
Imagine a world where you can buy
the exact products you want

00:08:05.858 --> 00:08:08.068
with the functionalities you need,

00:08:08.092 --> 00:08:10.040
with the design you want,

00:08:10.064 --> 00:08:11.650
with the same cost and lead time

00:08:11.674 --> 00:08:13.556
as a product that's been mass produced,

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.447
like your car, or your clothes
or your cell phone.

00:08:17.113 --> 00:08:19.790
The new manufacturing revolution
makes it possible.

00:08:20.577 --> 00:08:23.398
Advanced robots can be programmed

00:08:23.422 --> 00:08:26.541
in order to perform
any product configuration

00:08:26.565 --> 00:08:29.212
without any setup time or ramp up.

00:08:29.791 --> 00:08:35.651
3D printers instantaneously produce
any customized design.

00:08:35.675 --> 00:08:41.344
We are now able to produce
a batch of one product, your product,

00:08:41.368 --> 00:08:44.602
at the same cost and lead time
as a batch of many.

00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:49.436
Those are only a few examples
of the manufacturing revolution at play.

00:08:50.468 --> 00:08:54.555
Not only will manufacturing
become more productive,

00:08:54.579 --> 00:08:57.514
it will also become more flexible,

00:08:57.538 --> 00:09:02.069
and those were exactly the elements
of growth that we are missing.

00:09:03.106 --> 00:09:06.724
But actually, there are even
some bigger implications

00:09:06.748 --> 00:09:11.754
for all of us when manufacturing
will find its way back into the limelight.

00:09:12.441 --> 00:09:15.925
It will create a huge macroeconomic shift.

00:09:16.683 --> 00:09:21.120
First, our factories will be relocated
into our home markets.

00:09:21.877 --> 00:09:24.120
In the world of scale customization,

00:09:24.144 --> 00:09:26.745
consumer proximity is the new norm.

00:09:27.722 --> 00:09:31.894
Then, our factories
will be smaller, agile.

00:09:31.918 --> 00:09:35.027
Scale does not matter anymore,
flexibility does.

00:09:35.802 --> 00:09:39.395
They will be operating on a multi-product,
made-to-order basis.

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:42.067
The change will be drastic.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.105
Globalization will enter a new era.

00:09:47.145 --> 00:09:50.060
The East-to-West trade flows

00:09:50.084 --> 00:09:52.765
will be replaced by regional trade flows.

00:09:52.789 --> 00:09:55.094
East for East, West for West.

00:09:55.687 --> 00:09:56.927
When you think about that,

00:09:57.884 --> 00:10:00.294
the old model was pretty much insane.

00:10:01.065 --> 00:10:04.816
Piling up stocks, making products
travel the whole world

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.719
before they reach their end consumers.

00:10:06.743 --> 00:10:10.983
The new model, producing
just next to the consumer market,

00:10:11.007 --> 00:10:15.452
will be much cleaner,
much better for our environment.

00:10:16.678 --> 00:10:20.463
In mature economies,
manufacturing will be back home,

00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:22.563
creating more employment,

00:10:22.587 --> 00:10:24.954
more productivity and more growth.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.422
Good news, isn't it?

00:10:28.541 --> 00:10:30.346
But here's the thing with growth --

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.025
it does not come automatically.

00:10:32.328 --> 00:10:34.455
Mature economies will have to seize it.

00:10:35.196 --> 00:10:38.102
We'll have to massively
re-train our workforce.

00:10:38.547 --> 00:10:41.207
In most countries,
like in my country, France,

00:10:41.231 --> 00:10:44.333
we've told our children
that manufacturing had no future.

00:10:44.357 --> 00:10:46.334
That it was something happening far away.

00:10:46.358 --> 00:10:48.156
We need to reverse that

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.576
and teach manufacturing again
at university.

00:10:51.203 --> 00:10:54.688
Only the countries
that will boldly transform

00:10:54.712 --> 00:10:56.734
will be able to seize this growth.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.507
It's also a chance
for developing economies.

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:06.094
Of course China
and other emerging economies

00:11:06.118 --> 00:11:08.218
won't be the factory of the world anymore.

00:11:09.545 --> 00:11:14.163
Actually, it was not a sustainable
model in the long term,

00:11:14.187 --> 00:11:16.585
as those countries are becoming richer.

00:11:17.779 --> 00:11:22.803
Last year, it was already
as expensive to produce in Brazil

00:11:22.827 --> 00:11:24.170
as to produce in France.

00:11:26.184 --> 00:11:31.941
By 2018, manufacturing costs in China
will be on par with the US.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.601
The new manufacturing revolution

00:11:35.625 --> 00:11:40.405
will accelerate the transition
of those emerging economies

00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:43.651
towards a model driven
by domestic consumption.

00:11:43.675 --> 00:11:44.852
And this is good,

00:11:44.876 --> 00:11:47.233
because this is where growth
will be created.

00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:49.519
In the next five years,

00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:54.847
the next billion consumers in China
will inject more growth in our economies

00:11:54.871 --> 00:11:57.285
than the top five
European markets together.

00:11:59.944 --> 00:12:04.233
This fourth manufacturing revolution
is a chance for all of us.

00:12:05.046 --> 00:12:07.000
If we play it right,

00:12:07.024 --> 00:12:10.414
we'll see sustainable growth
in all of our economies.

00:12:10.969 --> 00:12:14.634
This means more wealth
distributed to all of us

00:12:14.658 --> 00:12:17.165
and a better future for our children.

00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:18.340
Thank you.

00:12:18.374 --> 00:12:25.731
(Applause)
