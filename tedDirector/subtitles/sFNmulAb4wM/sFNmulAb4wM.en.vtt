00:00:12.838 --> 00:00:14.812
I think the beautiful Malin [Akerman] put it perfectly.

00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:17.152
Every man deserves the opportunity

00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:19.775
to grow a little bit of luxury.

00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:21.605
Ladies and gentlemen, and more importantly,

00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:24.458
Mo Bros and Mo Sistas&nbsp;— (Laughter) —

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:26.994
for the next 17 minutes, I'm going to share with you

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:30.645
my Movember journey, and how, through that journey,

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:33.816
we've redefined charity, we're redefining the way

00:00:33.816 --> 00:00:36.954
prostate cancer researchers are working together

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:40.706
throughout the world, and I hope, through that process,

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:44.077
that I inspire you to create something significant

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:47.659
in your life, something significant that will go on

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.242
and make this world a better place.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:54.171
So the most common question I get asked,

00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:56.359
and I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.832
over drinks tonight, is how did this come about?

00:01:00.832 --> 00:01:03.395
How did Movember start?

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:06.132
Well, normally, a charity starts with the cause, and someone

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:09.194
that is directly affected by a cause.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:12.378
They then go on to create an event, and beyond that,

00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:15.548
a foundation to support that.

00:01:15.548 --> 00:01:20.251
Pretty much in every case, that's how a charity starts.

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:23.682
Not so with Movember. Movember started in a very

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:27.460
traditional Australian way. It was on a Sunday afternoon.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.048
I was with my brother and a mate having a few beers,

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.219
and I was watching the world go by,

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.628
had a few more beers, and the conversation turned

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:39.000
to '70s fashion — (Laughter)&nbsp;—

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.908
and how everything manages to come back into style.

00:01:41.908 --> 00:01:44.204
And a few more beers, I said, "There has to be some stuff

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:49.042
that hasn't come back." (Laughter)

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:52.564
Then one more beer and it was, whatever happened to the mustache?

00:01:52.564 --> 00:01:56.948
Why hasn't that made a comeback? (Laughter)

00:01:56.948 --> 00:01:58.501
So then there was a lot more beers, and then the day ended

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:03.711
with a challenge to bring the mustache back. (Laughter)

00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:06.444
So in Australia, "mo" is slang for mustache,

00:02:06.444 --> 00:02:09.452
so we renamed the month of November "Movember"

00:02:09.452 --> 00:02:12.399
and created some pretty basic rules, which still stand today.

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.166
And they are: start the month clean-shaven,

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:18.420
rock a mustache -- not a beard, not a goatee, a mustache --

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.195
for the 30 days of November, and then we agreed

00:02:21.195 --> 00:02:23.697
that we would come together at the end of the month,

00:02:23.697 --> 00:02:27.709
have a mustache-themed party, and award a prize

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.531
for the best, and of course, the worst mustache. (Laughter)

00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:34.005
Now trust me, when you're growing a mustache

00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:37.210
back in 2003, and there were 30 of us back then,

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.250
and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.714
— (Laughter) —

00:02:45.714 --> 00:02:50.251
it created a lot of controversy. (Laughter)

00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:52.546
So my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients.

00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:58.882
My girlfriend at the time, who's no longer my girlfriend — (Laughter) — hated it.

00:02:58.882 --> 00:03:04.542
Parents would shuffle kids away from us. (Laughter)

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:05.989
But we came together at the end of the month and

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.277
we celebrated our journey, and it was a real journey.

00:03:09.277 --> 00:03:14.049
And we had a lot of fun, and in 2004, I said to the guys,

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.236
"That was so much fun. We need to legitimize this

00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:22.019
so we can get away with it year on year." (Laughter)

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.858
So we started thinking about that, and we were inspired

00:03:25.858 --> 00:03:28.946
by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer.

00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:31.407
And we thought, you know what, there's nothing for men's health.

00:03:31.407 --> 00:03:35.320
Why is that? Why can't we combine growing a mustache

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.812
and doing something for men's health?

00:03:36.812 --> 00:03:39.476
And I started to research that topic, and discovered

00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:42.390
prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.351
in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it.

00:03:45.351 --> 00:03:47.919
But there was nothing for this cause,

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.074
so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer,

00:03:52.074 --> 00:03:54.180
and then we created our tagline, which is,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.189
"Changing the face of men's health."

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.928
And that eloquently describes the challenge,

00:03:58.928 --> 00:04:01.039
changing your appearance for the 30 days,

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:02.859
and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve:

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.495
getting men engaged in their health, having them have

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:09.799
a better understanding about the health risks that they face.

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.479
So with that model, I then

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.158
cold-called the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation.

00:04:15.158 --> 00:04:17.525
I said to him, "I've got the most amazing idea

00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:20.719
that's going to transform your organization." (Laughter)

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.138
And I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone,

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:25.494
so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:27.206
in 2004.

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:30.399
And we sat down, and I shared with him my vision

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:33.119
of getting men growing mustaches across Australia,

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:35.831
raising awareness for this cause,

00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:38.463
and funds for his organization. And I needed a partnership

00:04:38.463 --> 00:04:41.040
to legitimately do that.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.641
And I said, "We're going to come together at the end,

00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:45.311
we're going to have a mustache-themed party, we're going to have DJs,

00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:49.114
we're going to celebrate life, and we're going to change the face of men's health."

00:04:49.114 --> 00:04:51.891
And he just looked at me and laughed, and he said,

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:55.526
he said, "Adam, that's a really novel idea,

00:04:55.526 --> 00:04:58.031
but we're an ultraconservative organization.

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:02.847
We can't have anything to do with you." (Laughter)

00:05:02.847 --> 00:05:07.207
So I paid for coffee that day — (Laughter) —

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:10.210
and his parting comment as we shook hands was,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.873
"Listen, if you happen to raise any money out of this,

00:05:12.873 --> 00:05:17.427
we'll gladly take it." (Laughter)

00:05:17.427 --> 00:05:21.151
So my lesson that year was persistence.

00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:25.551
And we persisted, and we got 450 guys

00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:30.719
growing mustaches, and together we raised 54,000 dollars,

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.751
and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia,

00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:36.857
and that represented at the time the single biggest donation

00:05:36.857 --> 00:05:39.413
they'd ever received.

00:05:39.413 --> 00:05:44.014
So from that day forward, my life has become about a mustache.

00:05:44.014 --> 00:05:46.603
Every day -- this morning, I wake up and go, my life

00:05:46.603 --> 00:05:50.580
is about a mustache. (Laughter)

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.563
Essentially, I'm a mustache farmer. (Laughter)

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.828
And my season is November. (Applause)

00:05:58.828 --> 00:06:01.919
(Applause)

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.828
So in 2005, the campaign got more momentum,

00:06:05.828 --> 00:06:08.269
was more successful in Australia and then New Zealand,

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:13.027
and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point.

00:06:13.027 --> 00:06:16.764
It was consuming so much of our time after hours

00:06:16.764 --> 00:06:19.889
on weekends that we thought, we either need

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.203
to close this down or figure a way to fund Movember

00:06:23.203 --> 00:06:26.036
so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time

00:06:26.036 --> 00:06:29.866
in the organization and take it to the next level.

00:06:29.866 --> 00:06:32.724
It's really interesting when you try and figure a way

00:06:32.724 --> 00:06:34.865
to fund a fundraising organization

00:06:34.865 --> 00:06:37.320
built off growing mustaches. (Laughter)

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.691
Let me tell you that there's not too many people interested

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:43.723
in investing in that, not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation,

00:06:43.723 --> 00:06:46.988
who we'd raised about 1.2 million dollars for at that stage.

00:06:46.988 --> 00:06:51.123
So again we persisted, and Foster's Brewing came to the party

00:06:51.123 --> 00:06:54.263
and gave us our first ever sponsorship,

00:06:54.263 --> 00:06:58.836
and that was enough for me to quit my job, I did consulting on the side.

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:03.802
And leading into Movember 2006,

00:07:03.802 --> 00:07:06.387
we'd run through all the money from Foster's,

00:07:06.387 --> 00:07:09.545
we'd run through all the money I had, and essentially

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:12.643
we had no money left, and we'd convinced all our suppliers --

00:07:12.643 --> 00:07:14.836
creative agencies, web development agencies,

00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:19.289
hosting companies, whatnot -- to delay their billing until December.

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:22.319
So we'd racked up at this stage about 600,000 dollars

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:26.574
worth of debt. So if Movember 2006 didn't happen,

00:07:26.574 --> 00:07:29.944
the four founders, well, we would've been broke,

00:07:29.944 --> 00:07:31.637
we would've been homeless, sitting on the street

00:07:31.637 --> 00:07:34.495
with mustaches. (Laughter)

00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:36.400
But we thought, you know what, if that's the worst thing

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.645
that happens, so what?

00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:40.407
We're going to have a lot of fun doing it, and it taught us

00:07:40.407 --> 00:07:44.905
the importance of taking risks and really smart risks.

00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:49.168
Then in early 2007, a really interesting thing happened.

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:52.887
We had Mo Bros from Canada, from the U.S.,

00:07:52.887 --> 00:07:55.831
and from the U.K. emailing us and calling us and saying,

00:07:55.831 --> 00:07:57.815
hey, there's nothing for prostate cancer.

00:07:57.815 --> 00:08:01.317
Bring this campaign to these countries.

00:08:01.317 --> 00:08:03.679
So we thought, why not? Let's do it.

00:08:03.679 --> 00:08:06.809
So I cold-called the CEO of Prostate Cancer Canada,

00:08:06.809 --> 00:08:10.335
and I said to him, "I have this most amazing concept."

00:08:10.335 --> 00:08:12.103
(Laughter)

00:08:12.103 --> 00:08:15.150
"It's going to transform your organization. I don't want

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.614
to tell you about it now, but will you meet with me

00:08:16.614 --> 00:08:20.023
if I fly all the way to Toronto?" So I flew here,

00:08:20.023 --> 00:08:23.151
met down on Front Street East, and we sat in the boardroom,

00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:27.228
and I said, "Right, here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches

00:08:27.228 --> 00:08:31.999
all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization."

00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:33.240
And he looked at me and laughed and said,

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.598
"Adam, sounds like a really novel idea, but we're

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:38.493
an ultraconservative organization." (Laughter)

00:08:38.493 --> 00:08:41.500
I've heard this before. I know how it goes.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.974
But he said, "We will partner with you,

00:08:43.974 --> 00:08:47.192
but we're not going to invest in it. You need to figure

00:08:47.192 --> 00:08:50.063
a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work."

00:08:50.063 --> 00:08:51.976
So what we did was, we took some of the money that

00:08:51.976 --> 00:08:54.079
we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across

00:08:54.079 --> 00:08:56.680
to this country, the U.S, and the U.K., and we did that

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.136
because we knew, if this was successful,

00:08:59.136 --> 00:09:01.744
we could raise infinitely more money globally

00:09:01.744 --> 00:09:04.279
than we could just in Australia. And that money

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:07.365
fuels research, and that research will get us to a cure.

00:09:07.365 --> 00:09:09.119
And we're not about finding an Australian cure

00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:13.498
or a Canadian cure, we're about finding the cure.

00:09:13.498 --> 00:09:17.806
So in 2007, we brought the campaign across here,

00:09:17.806 --> 00:09:22.351
and it was, it set the stage for the campaign.

00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:24.384
It wasn't as successful as we thought it would be.

00:09:24.384 --> 00:09:27.034
We were sort of very gung ho with our success in Australia

00:09:27.034 --> 00:09:29.855
and New Zealand at that stage.

00:09:29.855 --> 00:09:33.359
So that year really taught us the importance of being patient

00:09:33.359 --> 00:09:35.647
and really understanding the local market before you

00:09:35.647 --> 00:09:39.295
become so bold as to set lofty targets.

00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:43.319
But what I'm really pleased to say is, in 2010,

00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:45.923
Movember became a truly global movement.

00:09:45.923 --> 00:09:48.199
Canada was just pipped to the post in terms of

00:09:48.199 --> 00:09:50.871
the number one fundraising campaign in the world.

00:09:50.871 --> 00:09:56.003
Last year we had 450,000 Mo Bros spread across the world

00:09:56.003 --> 00:10:00.055
and together we raised 77 million dollars.

00:10:00.055 --> 00:10:07.963
(Applause)

00:10:07.963 --> 00:10:10.302
And that makes Movember now the biggest funder

00:10:10.302 --> 00:10:14.545
of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world.

00:10:14.545 --> 00:10:16.894
And that is an amazing achievement when you think about

00:10:16.894 --> 00:10:20.630
us growing mustaches. (Laughter)

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.646
And for us, we have redefined charity.

00:10:22.646 --> 00:10:28.022
Our ribbon is a hairy ribbon. (Laughter)

00:10:28.022 --> 00:10:30.379
Our ambassadors are the Mo Bros and the Mo Sistas,

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:33.574
and I think that's been fundamental to our success.

00:10:33.574 --> 00:10:37.678
We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people.

00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:41.622
We let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way.

00:10:41.622 --> 00:10:44.221
So now I live in Los Angeles, because

00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:46.990
the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the U.S. is based there,

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.518
and I always get asked by the media down there,

00:10:49.518 --> 00:10:52.054
because it's so celebrity-driven,

00:10:52.054 --> 00:10:54.821
"Who are your celebrity ambassadors?"

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:57.622
And I say to them, "Last year we were fortunate enough

00:10:57.622 --> 00:11:01.084
to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors."

00:11:01.084 --> 00:11:02.324
And they go, "What, what do you mean?"

00:11:02.324 --> 00:11:05.286
And it's like, everything single person, every single Mo Bro

00:11:05.286 --> 00:11:07.877
and Mo Sista that participates in Movember

00:11:07.877 --> 00:11:11.367
is our celebrity ambassador, and that is so, so important

00:11:11.367 --> 00:11:14.286
and fundamental to our success.

00:11:14.286 --> 00:11:16.958
Now what I want to share with you is

00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958
one of my most touching Movember moments,

00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.798
and it happened here in Toronto last year,

00:11:23.798 --> 00:11:26.278
at the end of the campaign.

00:11:26.278 --> 00:11:29.719
I was out with a team. It was the end of Movember.

00:11:29.719 --> 00:11:32.472
We'd had a great campaign, and to be honest, we'd had

00:11:32.472 --> 00:11:35.246
our fair share of beer that night, but I said,

00:11:35.246 --> 00:11:38.713
"You know what, I think we've got one more bar left in us." (Laughter)

00:11:38.713 --> 00:11:42.118
So we piled into a taxi, and this is our taxi driver,

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.310
and I was sitting in the back seat, and he turned around

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.854
and said, "Where are you going?"

00:11:45.854 --> 00:11:48.936
And I said, "Hang on, that is an amazing mustache."

00:11:48.936 --> 00:11:53.343
(Laughter)

00:11:53.343 --> 00:11:55.279
And he said, "I'm doing it for Movember." And I said,

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:59.589
"So am I." And I said, "Tell me your Movember story."

00:11:59.589 --> 00:12:01.565
And he goes, "Listen, I know it's about men's health,

00:12:01.565 --> 00:12:04.627
I know it's about prostate cancer, but this is for breast cancer."

00:12:04.627 --> 00:12:06.275
And I said, "Okay, that's interesting."

00:12:06.275 --> 00:12:09.832
And he goes, "Last year, my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka,

00:12:09.832 --> 00:12:13.198
because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her,"

00:12:13.198 --> 00:12:17.510
and he said, "This mustache is my tribute to my mom."

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.338
And we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi,

00:12:20.338 --> 00:12:22.871
and I didn't tell him who I was, because I didn't think it was appropriate,

00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:24.814
and I just shook his hand and I said, "Thank you so much.

00:12:24.814 --> 00:12:26.158
Your mom would be so proud."

00:12:26.158 --> 00:12:28.086
And from that moment I realized that Movember

00:12:28.086 --> 00:12:31.124
is so much more than a mustache, having a joke.

00:12:31.124 --> 00:12:34.833
It's about each person coming to this platform,

00:12:34.833 --> 00:12:36.963
embracing it in their own way,

00:12:36.963 --> 00:12:40.036
and being significant in their own life.

00:12:40.036 --> 00:12:45.311
For us now at Movember, we really focus on

00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:49.583
three program areas, and having a true impact:

00:12:49.583 --> 00:12:52.000
awareness and education,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.787
survivor support programs, and research.

00:12:54.787 --> 00:12:58.332
Now we always focus, naturally, on how much we raise,

00:12:58.332 --> 00:13:01.453
because it's a very tangible outcome, but for me,

00:13:01.453 --> 00:13:05.660
awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise,

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.524
because I know that is changing and saving lives today,

00:13:08.524 --> 00:13:10.806
and it's probably best exampled by

00:13:10.806 --> 00:13:13.636
a young guy that I met at South by Southwest

00:13:13.636 --> 00:13:16.476
in Austin, Texas, at the start of the year.

00:13:16.476 --> 00:13:19.500
He came up to me and said, "Thank you for starting Movember."

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.432
And I said, "Thank you for doing Movember."

00:13:21.432 --> 00:13:25.292
And I looked at him, and I was like, "I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache." (Laughter)

00:13:25.292 --> 00:13:27.676
And I said, "What's your Movember story?"

00:13:27.676 --> 00:13:31.699
And he said, "I grew the worst mustache ever." (Laughter)

00:13:31.699 --> 00:13:34.269
"But I went home for Thanksgiving dinner, and pretty quickly

00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:36.269
the conversation around the table turned to

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:39.600
what the hell was going on." (Laughter)

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.748
"And we talked -- I talked to them about Movember,

00:13:43.748 --> 00:13:46.093
and then after that, my dad came up to me, and at the age

00:13:46.093 --> 00:13:50.164
of 26, for the first time ever, I had a conversation with my dad

00:13:50.164 --> 00:13:53.265
one on one about men's health. I had a conversation

00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:56.388
with my dad about prostate cancer, and I learned

00:13:56.388 --> 00:13:59.174
that my grandfather had prostate cancer

00:13:59.174 --> 00:14:02.357
and I was able to share with my dad that he was

00:14:02.357 --> 00:14:05.380
twice as likely to get that disease, and he didn't know that,

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.450
and he hadn't been getting screened for it."

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.947
So now, that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer.

00:14:10.947 --> 00:14:13.537
So those conversations, getting men engaged in this,

00:14:13.537 --> 00:14:16.332
at whatever age, is so critically important,

00:14:16.332 --> 00:14:18.354
and in my view so much more important

00:14:18.354 --> 00:14:21.469
than the funds we raise.

00:14:21.469 --> 00:14:24.269
Now to the funds we raise, and research,

00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:26.946
and how we're redefining research.

00:14:26.946 --> 00:14:31.584
We fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries.

00:14:31.584 --> 00:14:34.989
We literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions

00:14:34.989 --> 00:14:37.799
and researchers around the world, and when we looked

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:42.172
at this more recently, we realized there's a real lack

00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:46.331
of collaboration going on even within institutions,

00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:48.684
let alone nationally, let alone globally, and this is not unique

00:14:48.684 --> 00:14:52.104
to prostate cancer. This is cancer research the world over.

00:14:52.104 --> 00:14:55.722
And so we said, right, we'd redefined charity. We need

00:14:55.722 --> 00:14:59.773
to redefine the way these guys operate. How do we do that?

00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:03.382
So what we did was, we created a global action plan,

00:15:03.382 --> 00:15:05.199
and we're taking 10 percent of what's raised in each country

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:07.541
now and putting it into a global fund, and we've got

00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:10.277
the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world

00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:12.840
that look after that fund,

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.949
and they come together each year and identify

00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:17.936
the number one priority,

00:15:17.936 --> 00:15:21.832
and that, last year, was getting a better screening test.

00:15:21.832 --> 00:15:23.989
So they identified that as a priority, and then

00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:26.618
they've got and recruited now 300 researchers

00:15:26.618 --> 00:15:29.302
from around the world that are studying that topic,

00:15:29.302 --> 00:15:31.253
essentially the same topic.

00:15:31.253 --> 00:15:33.014
So now we're funding them to the tune of about

00:15:33.014 --> 00:15:35.797
five or six million dollars to collaborate

00:15:35.797 --> 00:15:38.405
and bringing them together, and that's a unique thing

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:41.381
in the cancer world, and we know, through that collaboration,

00:15:41.381 --> 00:15:44.773
it will accelerate outcomes.

00:15:44.773 --> 00:15:51.033
And that's how we're redefining the research world.

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:57.677
So, what I know about my Movember journey is that,

00:15:57.677 --> 00:16:00.819
with a really creative idea,

00:16:00.819 --> 00:16:05.236
with passion, with persistence, and a lot of patience,

00:16:05.236 --> 00:16:08.266
four mates, four mustaches,

00:16:08.266 --> 00:16:10.589
can inspire a room full of people,

00:16:10.589 --> 00:16:13.502
and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city,

00:16:13.502 --> 00:16:15.702
and that city is Melbourne, my home.

00:16:15.702 --> 00:16:18.965
And that city can go on and inspire a state, and that state

00:16:18.965 --> 00:16:22.538
can go on and inspire a nation, and beyond that,

00:16:22.538 --> 00:16:25.381
you can create a global movement

00:16:25.381 --> 00:16:27.750
that is changing the face of men's health.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.125
My name is Adam Garone, and that's my story.

00:16:30.125 --> 00:16:32.787
Thank you. (Applause)
