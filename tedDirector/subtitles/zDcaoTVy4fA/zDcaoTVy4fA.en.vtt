00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
is one of the major threats against our fauna,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
especially birds,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and mainly to supply the pet market

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.260
with thousands of animals taken from nature every month,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and transported far from their origins,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.260
to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
It is estimated that

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
withdraw from nature

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.260
almost 38 million animals every year,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.260
a business worth almost two billion dollars.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
The police intercepts

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
these huge cargos with live animals,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
intended to supply the pet market,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.260
or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
and this is how we end up, every month,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.260
with thousands of seized animals.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And for us to understand what happens with them,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.260
we're going to follow Brad.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
In the eyes of many people,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
after the animals are seized,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
they say, "Yay, justice has been served.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
The good guys arrived,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
took the cute, mistreated animals

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
from the hands of the evil traffickers,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and everyone lived happily ever after."

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
But did they? Actually, no,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and this is where many of our problems begin.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Because we have to figure out

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
what to do with all these animals.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
In Brazil, they are usually first sent

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
to governmental triage facilities,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
in which most of the cases,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
the conditions are as bad as

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
with the traffickers.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
In 2002, these centers received

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
45,000 animals,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
of which 37,000 were birds.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And the police estimates that we seize

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.260
only five percent of what's being trafficked.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Some lucky ones -- and among them, Brad --

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
go to serious rehabilitation centers after that.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And in these places they are cared for.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
They train their flying,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
and they are able to socialize

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
with others from the same species.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
(Laughter)

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
But then what?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
The Brazil Ornithological Society --

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
so now we're talking only birds --

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
claims that we have too little knowledge

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
about the species in nature.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Therefore, it would be too risky

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
to release these animals,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.260
both for the released and for the natural populations.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
They also claim that we spend too many resources

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
in their rehabilitation.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Following this argument,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
they suggest that all the birds

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
seized from non-threatened species

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
should be euthanized.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.260
However, this would mean having killed

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.260
26,267 birds,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.260
only in the state of São Paulo, only in 2006.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.260
But, some researchers, myself included --

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.260
some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government --

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
believe there is an alternative.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
We think that if and when the animals meet

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
certain criteria concerning their health,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
behavior, inferred origin

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.260
and whatever we know about the natural populations,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.260
then technically responsible releases are possible,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
both for the well-being of the individual,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.260
because we will be returning genes for these populations --

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
which could be important for them

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
in facing environmental challenges --

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
and also we could be returning

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.260
potential seed dispersers, predators, preys, etc.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
All of these were released by us.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
On the top, the turtles are just enjoying freedom.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
(Laughter)

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
On the middle,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
And on the bottom, my personal favorite,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
the little male over there,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
four hours after his release

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.260
he was together with a wild female.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
So, this is not new, people have been

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
doing this around the world.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
But it's still a big issue in Brazil.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
We believe we have performed

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
responsible releases.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.260
We've registered released animals mating in nature

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and having chicks.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.260
So, these genes are indeed going back to the populations.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
However this is still a minority

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
for the very lack of knowledge.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
So, I say, "Let's study more, let's shed light on this issue,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
let's do whatever we can."

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
I'm devoting my career to that.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
And I'm here to urge each and every one of you

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
to do whatever is in your reach:

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Talk to your neighbor, teach your children,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
make sure your pet is from a legal breeder.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
We need to act, and act now,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
before these ones are the only ones left.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Thank you very much.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.260
(Applause)
