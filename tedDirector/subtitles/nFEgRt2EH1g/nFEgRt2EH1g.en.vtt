00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.840
Space, the final frontier.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.336
I first heard these words
when I was just six years old,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.616
and I was completely inspired.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.016
I wanted to explore strange new worlds.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.536
I wanted to seek out new life.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.760
I wanted to see everything
that the universe had to offer.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.536
And those dreams, those words,
they took me on a journey,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.016
a journey of discovery,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.216
through school, through university,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.680
to do a PhD and finally
to become a professional astronomer.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.936
Now, I learned two amazing things,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.496
one slightly unfortunate,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.576
when I was doing my PhD.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.016
I learned that the reality was

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.200
I wouldn't be piloting
a starship anytime soon.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.056
But I also learned that the universe
is strange, wonderful and vast,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.880
actually too vast
to be explored by spaceship.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.080
And so I turned my attention
to astronomy, to using telescopes.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.616
Now, I show you before you
an image of the night sky.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.560
You might see it anywhere in the world.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.000
And all of these stars are part
of our local galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.256
Now, if you were to go
to a darker part of the sky,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.816
a nice dark site, perhaps in the desert,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.256
you might see the center
of our Milky Way galaxy

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.240
spread out before you,
hundreds of billions of stars.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.416
And it's a very beautiful image.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.776
It's colorful.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.416
And again, this is just
a local corner of our universe.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.736
You can see there's
a sort of strange dark dust across it.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.736
Now, that is local dust

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.416
that's obscuring the light of the stars.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.016
But we can do a pretty good job.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.496
Just with our own eyes, we can explore
our little corner of the universe.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.856
It's possible to do better.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.640
You can use wonderful telescopes
like the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.376
Now, astronomers
have put together this image.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.296
It's called the Hubble Deep Field,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.656
and they've spent hundreds of hours
observing just a tiny patch of the sky

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.080
no larger than your thumbnail
held at arm's length.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.776
And in this image

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.456
you can see thousands of galaxies,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.936
and we know that there must be
hundreds of millions, billions of galaxies

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.336
in the entire universe,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.016
some like our own and some very different.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.696
So you think, OK, well,
I can continue this journey.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.416
This is easy. I can just
use a very powerful telescope

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.240
and just look at the sky, no problem.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.976
It's actually really missing out
if we just do that.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.736
Now, that's because
everything I've talked about so far

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.656
is just using the visible spectrum,
just the thing that your eyes can see,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.096
and that's a tiny slice,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.480
a tiny, tiny slice
of what the universe has to offer us.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.896
Now, there's also two very important
problems with using visible light.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.656
Not only are we missing out
on all the other processes

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.856
that are emitting other kinds of light,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.296
but there's two issues.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.696
Now, the first is that dust
that I mentioned earlier.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.656
The dust stops the visible light
from getting to us.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.376
So as we look deeper
into the universe, we see less light.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.960
The dust stops it getting to us.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.936
But there's a really strange problem
with using visible light

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.920
in order to try and explore the universe.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.896
Now take a break for a minute.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.600
Say you're standing on a corner,
a busy street corner.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.576
There's cars going by.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.000
An ambulance approaches.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.216
It has a high-pitched siren.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.976
(Imitates a siren passing by)

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.336
The siren appeared to change in pitch

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.440
as it moved towards and away from you.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.840
The ambulance driver did not change
the siren just to mess with you.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.616
That was a product of your perception.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.376
The sound waves,
as the ambulance approached,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.616
were compressed,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.576
and they changed higher in pitch.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.376
As the ambulance receded,
the sound waves were stretched,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.456
and they sounded lower in pitch.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.480
The same thing happens with light.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.416
Objects moving towards us,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.616
their light waves are compressed
and they appear bluer.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.856
Objects moving away from us,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.536
their light waves are stretched,
and they appear redder.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.440
So we call these effects
blueshift and redshift.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.376
Now, our universe is expanding,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.576
so everything is moving away
from everything else,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.280
and that means
everything appears to be red.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.776
And oddly enough, as you look
more deeply into the universe,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.096
more distant objects
are moving away further and faster,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.839
so they appear more red.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.495
So if I come back to the Hubble Deep Field

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:35.216
and we were to continue
to peer deeply into the universe

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.776
just using the Hubble,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.496
as we get to a certain distance away,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.120
everything becomes red,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.896
and that presents something of a problem.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.976
Eventually, we get so far away

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.976
everything is shifted into the infrared

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and we can't see anything at all.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.376
So there must be a way around this.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.216
Otherwise, I'm limited in my journey.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.136
I wanted to explore the whole universe,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.080
not just whatever I can see,
you know, before the redshift kicks in.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.416
There is a technique.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.816
It's called radio astronomy.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.176
Astronomers have been
using this for decades.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.496
It's a fantastic technique.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.006
I show you the Parkes Radio Telescope,
affectionately known as "The Dish."

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.816
You may have seen the movie.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.416
And radio is really brilliant.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.976
It allows us to peer much more deeply.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.696
It doesn't get stopped by dust,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.976
so you can see everything in the universe,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.856
and redshift is less of a problem

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.080
because we can build receivers
that receive across a large band.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.536
So what does Parkes see when we turn it
to the center of the Milky Way?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.520
We should see something fantastic, right?

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.056
Well, we do see something interesting.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.736
All that dust has gone.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.200
As I mentioned, radio goes
straight through dust, so not a problem.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.736
But the view is very different.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.576
We can see that the center
of the Milky Way is aglow,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.280
and this isn't starlight.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.096
This is a light called
synchrotron radiation,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.720
and it's formed from electrons
spiraling around cosmic magnetic fields.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.376
So the plane is aglow with this light.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.696
And we can also see
strange tufts coming off of it,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.216
and objects which don't appear to line up

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.560
with anything that we can see
with our own eyes.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.656
But it's hard to really
interpret this image,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.456
because as you can see,
it's very low resolution.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.656
Radio waves have a wavelength that's long,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.976
and that makes their resolution poorer.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.056
This image is also black and white,

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.840
so we don't really know
what is the color of everything in here.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.016
Well, fast-forward to today.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.496
We can build telescopes

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.136
which can get over these problems.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.496
Now, I'm showing you here an image
of the Murchison Radio Observatory,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.296
a fantastic place
to build radio telescopes.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.616
It's flat, it's dry,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.616
and most importantly, it's radio quiet:

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.736
no mobile phones, no Wi-Fi, nothing,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.256
just very, very radio quiet,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.000
so a perfect place
to build a radio telescope.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.736
Now, the telescope that I've been
working on for a few years

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.696
is called the Murchison Widefield Array,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.736
and I'm going to show you
a little time lapse of it being built.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.016
This is a group of undergraduate
and postgraduate students

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.296
located in Perth.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.056
We call them the Student Army,

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.896
and they volunteered their time
to build a radio telescope.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.560
There's no course credit for this.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.216
And they're putting together
these radio dipoles.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.200
They just receive at low frequencies,
a bit like your FM radio or your TV.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.096
And here we are deploying them
across the desert.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.536
The final telescope
covers 10 square kilometers

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.696
of the Western Australian desert.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.696
And the interesting thing is,
there's no moving parts.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.976
We just deploy these little antennas

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.856
essentially on chicken mesh.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.296
It's fairly cheap.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.296
Cables take the signals

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.376
from the antennas

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.936
and bring them
to central processing units.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.736
And it's the size of this telescope,

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.416
the fact that we've built it
over the entire desert

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.240
that gives us a better
resolution than Parkes.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.416
Now, eventually all those cables
bring them to a unit

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.976
which sends it off
to a supercomputer here in Perth,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.286
and that's where I come in.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.536
(Sighs)

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.776
Radio data.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.616
I have spent the last five years

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.496
working with very difficult,
very interesting data

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.496
that no one had really looked at before.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.656
I've spent a long time calibrating it,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.576
running millions of CPU hours
on supercomputers

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.800
and really trying to understand that data.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.296
And with this telescope,

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.576
with this data,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.536
we've performed a survey
of the entire southern sky,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.656
the GaLactic and Extragalactic
All-sky MWA Survey,

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.560
or GLEAM, as I call it.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.896
And I'm very excited.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.301
This survey is just about to be published,
but it hasn't been shown yet,

00:08:41.325 --> 00:08:43.256
so you are literally the first people

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.080
to see this southern survey
of the entire sky.

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:50.120
So I'm delighted to share with you
some images from this survey.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.775
Now, imagine you went to the Murchison,

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:54.895
you camped out underneath the stars

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:56.536
and you looked towards the south.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.227
You saw the south's celestial pole,

00:08:58.251 --> 00:08:59.456
the galaxy rising.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.096
If I fade in the radio light,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.776
this is what we observe with our survey.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.856
You can see that the galactic plane
is no longer dark with dust.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.296
It's alight with synchrotron radiation,

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.816
and thousands of dots are in the sky.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.136
Our large Magellanic Cloud,
our nearest galactic neighbor,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.376
is orange instead
of its more familiar blue-white.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.776
So there's a lot going on in this.
Let's take a closer look.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.216
If we look back
towards the galactic center,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.456
where we originally saw the Parkes image
that I showed you earlier,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.856
low resolution, black and white,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.960
and we fade to the GLEAM view,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.056
you can see the resolution
has gone up by a factor of a hundred.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.936
We now have a color view of the sky,

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.296
a technicolor view.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.296
Now, it's not a false color view.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.720
These are real radio colors.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.416
What I've done is I've colored
the lowest frequencies red

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.056
and the highest frequencies blue,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.656
and the middle ones green.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.896
And that gives us this rainbow view.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.176
And this isn't just false color.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.136
The colors in this image
tell us about the physical processes

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.400
going on in the universe.

00:10:03.974 --> 00:10:06.736
So for instance, if you look
along the plane of the galaxy,

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.216
it's alight with synchrotron,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.616
which is mostly reddish orange,

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.760
but if we look very closely,
we see little blue dots.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.896
Now, if we zoom in,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.456
these blue dots are ionized plasma

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.120
around very bright stars,

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.456
and what happens
is that they block the red light,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.120
so they appear blue.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.816
And these can tell us
about these star-forming regions

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.096
in our galaxy.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.736
And we just see them immediately.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.816
We look at the galaxy,
and the color tells us that they're there.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.416
You can see little soap bubbles,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.856
little circular images
around the galactic plane,

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.880
and these are supernova remnants.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.296
When a star explodes,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.776
its outer shell is cast off

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.096
and it travels outward into space
gathering up material,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.080
and it produces a little shell.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.176
It's been a long-standing
mystery to astronomers

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.280
where all the supernova remnants are.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.296
We know that there must be a lot
of high-energy electrons in the plane

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.976
to produce the synchrotron
radiation that we see,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.576
and we think they're produced
by supernova remnants,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.376
but there don't seem to be enough.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.296
Fortunately, GLEAM is really, really
good at detecting supernova remnants,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.800
so we're hoping to have
a new paper out on that soon.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.056
Now, that's fine.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.416
We've explored our little local universe,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.816
but I wanted to go deeper,
I wanted to go further.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.920
I wanted to go beyond the Milky Way.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.296
Well, as it happens, we can see a very
interesting object in the top right,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.536
and this is a local radio galaxy,

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.800
Centaurus A.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.496
If we zoom in on this,

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.920
we can see that there are
two huge plumes going out into space.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.496
And if you look right in the center
between those two plumes,

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.896
you'll see a galaxy just like our own.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.376
It's a spiral. It has a dust lane.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.016
It's a normal galaxy.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.656
But these jets
are only visible in the radio.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.856
If we looked in the visible,
we wouldn't even know they were there,

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.920
and they're thousands of times larger
than the host galaxy.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.880
What's going on?
What's producing these jets?

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.696
At the center of every galaxy
that we know about

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.976
is a supermassive black hole.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.416
Now, black holes are invisible.
That's why they're called that.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.456
All you can see is the deflection
of the light around them,

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.776
and occasionally, when a star
or a cloud of gas comes into their orbit,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.536
it is ripped apart by tidal forces,

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.040
forming what we call an accretion disk.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.856
The accretion disk
glows brightly in the x-rays,

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.296
and huge magnetic fields
can launch the material into space

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.040
at nearly the speed of light.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.680
So these jets are visible in the radio

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.400
and this is what we pick up in our survey.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.056
Well, very well, so we've seen
one radio galaxy. That's nice.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.256
But if you just look
at the top of that image,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.016
you'll see another radio galaxy.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.280
It's a little bit smaller,
and that's just because it's further away.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.456
OK. Two radio galaxies.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.056
We can see this. This is fine.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.816
Well, what about all the other dots?

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.400
Presumably those are just stars.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.096
They're not.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.720
They're all radio galaxies.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.216
Every single one of the dots in this image

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.976
is a distant galaxy,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.856
millions to billions of light-years away

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.496
with a supermassive
black hole at its center

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.096
pushing material into space
at nearly the speed of light.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.880
It is mind-blowing.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.416
And this survey is even larger
than what I've shown here.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.976
If we zoom out to
the full extent of the survey,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.096
you can see I found 300,000
of these radio galaxies.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.016
So it's truly an epic journey.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.696
We've discovered all of these galaxies

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.280
right back to the very first
supermassive black holes.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.740
I'm very proud of this,
and it will be published next week.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.096
Now, that's not all.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.456
I've explored the furthest reaches
of the galaxy with this survey,

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.440
but there's something
even more in this image.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.616
Now, I'll take you right back
to the dawn of time.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.296
When the universe formed,
it was a big bang,

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.376
which left the universe
as a sea of hydrogen,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.896
neutral hydrogen.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.696
And when the very first stars
and galaxies switched on,

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.816
they ionized that hydrogen.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.280
So the universe went
from neutral to ionized.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.336
That imprinted a signal all around us.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.096
Everywhere, it pervades us,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.536
like the Force.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.280
Now, because that happened so long ago,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.800
the signal was redshifted,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.856
so now that signal
is at very low frequencies.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.336
It's at the same frequency as my survey,

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.736
but it's so faint.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.640
It's a billionth the size
of any of the objects in my survey.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.216
So our telescope may not be quite
sensitive enough to pick up this signal.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.736
However, there's a new radio telescope.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.416
So I can't have a starship,

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.696
but I can hopefully have

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.576
one of the biggest
radio telescopes in the world.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.216
We're building the Square Kilometre Array,
a new radio telescope,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.976
and it's going to be a thousand
times bigger than the MWA,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.216
a thousand times more sensitive,
and have an even better resolution.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.456
So we should find
tens of millions of galaxies.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.816
And perhaps, deep in that signal,

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.016
I will get to look upon the very first
stars and galaxies switching on,

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.400
the beginning of time itself.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.136
Thank you.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.920
(Applause)
