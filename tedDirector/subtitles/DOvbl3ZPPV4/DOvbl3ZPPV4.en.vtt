00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:14.379
I don't know if you've noticed,

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.051
but there's been a spate of books

00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:17.926
that have come out lately

00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:20.068
contemplating or speculating

00:00:20.068 --> 00:00:24.479
on the cognition and emotional life of dogs.

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:27.350
Do they think, do they feel and, if so, how?

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.290
So this afternoon, in my limited time,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.985
I wanted to take the guesswork out of a lot of that

00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:34.481
by introducing you to two dogs,

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:39.305
both of whom have taken the command "speak"

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:43.266
quite literally.

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.026
The first dog is the first to go,

00:00:46.026 --> 00:00:50.275
and he is contemplating an aspect

00:00:50.275 --> 00:00:52.431
of his relationship to his owner,

00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:57.431
and the title is "A Dog on His Master."

00:00:57.431 --> 00:00:59.411
"As young as I look,

00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:02.361
I am growing older faster than he.

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:06.386
Seven to one is the ratio, they tend to say.

00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:09.971
Whatever the number, I will pass him one day

00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:11.839
and take the lead,

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:14.760
the way I do on our walks in the woods,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.258
and if this ever manages to cross his mind,

00:01:18.258 --> 00:01:20.564
it would be the sweetest shadow

00:01:20.564 --> 00:01:25.616
I have ever cast on snow or grass."

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:28.195
(Applause)

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:31.001
Thank you.

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.140
And our next dog

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.661
speaks in something called the revenant,

00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:39.692
which means a spirit that comes back

00:01:39.692 --> 00:01:43.458
to visit you.

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:47.326
"I am the dog you put to sleep,

00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:50.778
as you like to call the needle of oblivion,

00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:53.680
come back to tell you this simple thing:

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.304
I never liked you."

00:01:55.304 --> 00:01:57.914
(Laughter)

00:01:57.914 --> 00:01:59.808
"When I licked your face,

00:01:59.808 --> 00:02:02.701
I thought of biting off your nose.

00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:05.680
When I watched you toweling yourself dry,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.788
I wanted to leap and unman you with a snap.

00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:11.970
I resented the way you moved,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.856
your lack of animal grace,

00:02:13.856 --> 00:02:16.401
the way you would sit in a chair to eat,

00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:20.703
a napkin on your lap, a knife in your hand.

00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:22.161
I would have run away

00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:23.911
but I was too weak,

00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:25.547
a trick you taught me

00:02:25.547 --> 00:02:28.612
while I was learning to sit and heel

00:02:28.612 --> 00:02:30.745
and, greatest of insults,

00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:34.923
shake hands without a hand.

00:02:34.923 --> 00:02:38.427
I admit the sight of the leash would excite me,

00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:41.224
but only because it meant I was about to smell things

00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:46.063
you had never touched.

00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:47.999
You do not want to believe this,

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.365
but I have no reason to lie:

00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:54.449
I hated the car, hated the rubber toys,

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:59.235
disliked your friends, and worse, your relatives.

00:02:59.235 --> 00:03:03.183
The jingling of my tags drove me mad.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.430
You always scratched me in the wrong place."

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.432
(Laughter)

00:03:08.432 --> 00:03:11.210
"All I ever wanted from you was food and water

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.402
in my bowls.

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:15.475
While you slept, I watched you breathe

00:03:15.475 --> 00:03:17.805
as the moon rose in the sky.

00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:19.422
It took all of my strength

00:03:19.422 --> 00:03:22.478
not to raise my head and howl.

00:03:22.478 --> 00:03:24.978
Now, I am free of the collar,

00:03:24.978 --> 00:03:27.488
free of the yellow raincoat,

00:03:27.488 --> 00:03:29.366
monogrammed sweater,

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:32.396
the absurdity of your lawn,

00:03:32.396 --> 00:03:35.139
and that is all you need to know about this place,

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.240
except what you already supposed

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.642
and are glad it did not happen sooner,

00:03:40.642 --> 00:03:43.883
that everyone here can read and write,

00:03:43.883 --> 00:03:47.233
the dogs in poetry,

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:50.240
the cats and all the others

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.630
in prose."

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.330
Thank you.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.628
(Applause)
