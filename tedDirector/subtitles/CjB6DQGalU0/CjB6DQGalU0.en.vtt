00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:16.403
The world is filled
with incredible objects

00:00:16.427 --> 00:00:18.355
and rich cultural heritage.

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:21.419
And when we get access to them,

00:00:21.443 --> 00:00:23.827
we are blown away, we fall in love.

00:00:24.652 --> 00:00:26.249
But most of the time,

00:00:26.273 --> 00:00:31.065
the world's population is living
without real access to arts and culture.

00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:37.299
What might the connections be
when we start exploring our heritage,

00:00:37.323 --> 00:00:40.530
the beautiful locations
and the art in this world?

00:00:41.427 --> 00:00:44.201
Before we get started
in this presentation,

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:47.200
I just want to take care
of a few housekeeping points.

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:50.999
First, I am no expert in art or culture.

00:00:51.023 --> 00:00:53.749
I fell into this by mistake,
but I'm loving it.

00:00:54.356 --> 00:00:57.352
Secondly, all of what
I'm going to show you

00:00:57.376 --> 00:01:01.341
belongs to the amazing museums,
archives and foundations

00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:02.791
that we partner with.

00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:04.671
None of this belongs to Google.

00:01:05.235 --> 00:01:08.424
And finally, what you see behind me

00:01:08.448 --> 00:01:11.799
is available right now
on your mobile phones,

00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:12.997
on your laptops.

00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:15.425
This is our current platform,
where you can explore

00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:18.860
thousands of museums
and objects at your fingertips,

00:01:18.884 --> 00:01:21.395
in extremely high-definition detail.

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:24.312
The diversity of the content
is what's amazing.

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:26.505
If we just had European paintings,

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:28.260
if we just had modern art,

00:01:28.284 --> 00:01:30.086
I think it gets a bit boring.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.969
For example, this month,
we launched the "Black History" channel

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.582
with 82 curated exhibitions,

00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:40.172
which talk about arts and culture
in that community.

00:01:40.196 --> 00:01:43.819
We also have some
amazing objects from Japan,

00:01:43.843 --> 00:01:47.947
centered around craftsmanship,
called "Made in Japan."

00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:51.098
And one of my favorite exhibitions,

00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:53.527
which actually is the idea of my talk,

00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:57.414
is -- I didn't expect to become
a fan of Japanese dolls.

00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:00.602
But I am, thanks to this exhibition,

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:04.111
that has really taught me
about the craftsmanship

00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:06.257
behind the soul of a Japanese doll.

00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:08.509
Trust me, it's very exciting.

00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:09.881
Take my word for it.

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:11.914
So, moving on swiftly.

00:02:11.938 --> 00:02:14.770
One quick thing I wanted
to showcase in this platform,

00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:17.729
which you can share with your kids
and your friends right now,

00:02:17.753 --> 00:02:22.009
is you can travel to all these
amazing institutions virtually, as well.

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:25.619
One of our recent ideas was with
The Guggenheim Museum in New York,

00:02:25.643 --> 00:02:29.001
where you can get a taste
of what it might feel like

00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:30.176
to actually be there.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.967
You can go to the ground floor

00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:34.680
and obviously, most of you,
I assume, have been there.

00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:37.441
And you can see the architectural
masterpiece that it is.

00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:40.559
But imagine this accessibility
for a kid in Bombay

00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:42.303
who's studying architecture,

00:02:42.327 --> 00:02:45.382
who hasn't had a chance
to go to The Guggenheim as yet.

00:02:45.406 --> 00:02:48.491
You can obviously look at objects
in the Guggenheim Museum,

00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:51.233
you can obviously get into them
and so on and so forth.

00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:53.132
There's a lot of information here.

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:57.005
But this is not the purpose
of my talk today.

00:02:57.543 --> 00:02:59.309
This exists right now.

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:03.259
What we now have are the building blocks
to a very exciting future,

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.998
when it comes to arts and culture

00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:07.633
and accessibility to arts and culture.

00:03:07.657 --> 00:03:12.125
So I am joined today onstage
by my good friend and artist in residence

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.492
at our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne,

00:03:14.516 --> 00:03:16.645
who is the professor of interactive design

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.306
at ECAL University
in Lausanne, Switzerland.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.944
What Cyril and our team
of engineers have been doing

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:25.103
is trying to find these connections
and visualize a few of these.

00:03:25.127 --> 00:03:26.940
So I'm going to go quite quick now.

00:03:26.964 --> 00:03:30.566
This object you see
behind me -- oh, just clarification:

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.541
Always, seeing the real thing is better.

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:35.428
In case people think
I'm trying to replicate the real thing.

00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:36.659
So, moving on.

00:03:37.155 --> 00:03:40.671
This object you see behind me
is the Venus of Berekhat Ram.

00:03:40.695 --> 00:03:42.771
It's one of the oldest
objects in the world,

00:03:42.795 --> 00:03:45.969
found in the Golan Heights
around 233,000 years ago,

00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:49.122
and currently residing
at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:51.767
It is also one of the oldest
objects on our platform.

00:03:52.322 --> 00:03:53.668
So let's zoom.

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:55.457
We start from this one object.

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:58.522
What if we zoomed out

00:03:58.546 --> 00:04:03.052
and actually tried to experience
our own cultural big bang?

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.654
What might that look like?

00:04:05.474 --> 00:04:09.131
This is what we deal with on a daily basis
at the Cultural Institute --

00:04:09.155 --> 00:04:14.117
over six million cultural artifacts
curated and given to us by institutions,

00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:16.087
to actually make these connections.

00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:17.510
You can travel through time,

00:04:17.534 --> 00:04:21.045
you can understand more
about our society through these.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:25.469
You can look at it
from the perspective of our planet,

00:04:25.493 --> 00:04:28.128
and try to see how
it might look without borders,

00:04:28.152 --> 00:04:30.823
if we just organized art and culture.

00:04:30.847 --> 00:04:33.075
We can also then plot it by time,

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.179
which obviously, for the data geek
in me, is very fascinating.

00:04:37.203 --> 00:04:40.589
You can spend hours
looking at every decade

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:43.929
and the contributions
in that decade and in those years

00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:46.286
for art, history and cultures.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.689
We would love to spend hours
showing you each and every decade,

00:04:49.713 --> 00:04:51.574
but we don't have the time right now.

00:04:51.598 --> 00:04:54.857
So you can go on your phone
and actually do it yourself.

00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:58.343
(Applause)

00:04:58.367 --> 00:05:01.469
But if you don't mind
and can hold your applause till later,

00:05:01.493 --> 00:05:03.041
I don't want to run out of time,

00:05:03.065 --> 00:05:05.264
because I want to show you
a lot of cool stuff.

00:05:05.288 --> 00:05:06.788
So, just very quickly:

00:05:06.812 --> 00:05:10.798
you can move on from here
to another very interesting idea.

00:05:10.822 --> 00:05:12.533
Beyond the pretty picture,

00:05:12.557 --> 00:05:14.346
beyond the nice visualization,

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.697
what is the purpose, how is this useful?

00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:21.450
This next idea comes
from discussions with curators

00:05:21.474 --> 00:05:23.109
that we've been having at museums,

00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:25.156
who, by the way, I've fallen in love with,

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.374
because they dedicate their whole life
to try to tell these stories.

00:05:28.398 --> 00:05:31.329
One of the curators told me,
"Amit, what would it be like

00:05:31.353 --> 00:05:33.832
if you could create
a virtual curator's table

00:05:33.856 --> 00:05:36.159
where all these six million objects

00:05:36.183 --> 00:05:40.586
are displayed in a way for us
to look at the connections between them?"

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.639
You can spend a lot of time, trust me,
looking at different objects

00:05:44.663 --> 00:05:46.616
and understanding where they come from.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.848
It's a crazy Matrix experience.

00:05:48.872 --> 00:05:49.886
(Laughter)

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.196
Just moving on,

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.391
let's take the world-famous
Vincent Van Gogh,

00:05:54.415 --> 00:05:58.130
who is very well-represented
on this platform.

00:05:58.154 --> 00:06:00.930
Thanks to the diversity
of the institutions we have,

00:06:00.954 --> 00:06:06.658
we have over 211 high-definition,
amazing artworks by this artist,

00:06:06.682 --> 00:06:10.429
now organized in one beautiful view.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:13.426
And as it resolves,
and as Cyril goes deeper,

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.659
you can see all the self-portraits,

00:06:15.683 --> 00:06:17.108
you can see still life.

00:06:17.132 --> 00:06:19.735
But I just wanted to highlight
one very quick example,

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.447
which is very timely:

00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:22.782
"The Bedroom."

00:06:22.806 --> 00:06:25.107
This is an artwork
where three copies exist --

00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:27.461
one at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,

00:06:27.485 --> 00:06:29.472
one at the Orsay in Paris

00:06:29.496 --> 00:06:31.430
and one at the Art Institute of Chicago,

00:06:31.454 --> 00:06:33.957
which, actually, currently
is hosting a reunion

00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:35.756
of all three artworks physically,

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.917
I think only for the second time ever.

00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:42.860
But, it is united digitally and virtually
for anybody to look at

00:06:42.884 --> 00:06:44.805
in a very different way,

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:47.862
and you won't get pushed
in the line in the crowd.

00:06:47.886 --> 00:06:52.628
So let's take you and let's travel
through "The Bedroom" very quickly,

00:06:52.652 --> 00:06:56.239
so you can experience what we are doing
for every single object.

00:06:56.263 --> 00:06:59.714
We want the image to speak
as much as it can

00:06:59.738 --> 00:07:01.382
on a digital platform.

00:07:01.406 --> 00:07:04.553
And all you need is an internet
connection and a computer

00:07:04.577 --> 00:07:08.915
(Applause)

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:11.497
And, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.

00:07:11.521 --> 00:07:13.005
I'm sorry, this is all live,

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:15.464
so you have to give Cyril
a little bit of --

00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:18.461
and this is available for every object:

00:07:18.485 --> 00:07:21.200
modern art, contemporary art,
Renaissance -- you name it,

00:07:21.224 --> 00:07:22.411
even sculpture.

00:07:23.802 --> 00:07:27.397
Sometimes, you don't know
what can attract you

00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:32.649
to an artwork or to a museum
or to a cultural discovery.

00:07:32.673 --> 00:07:35.415
So for me, personally,
it was quite a challenge

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:38.661
because when I decided to make this
my full-time job at Google,

00:07:38.685 --> 00:07:41.288
my mother was not very supportive.

00:07:41.312 --> 00:07:42.559
I love my mother,

00:07:42.583 --> 00:07:45.582
but she thought I was wasting my life
with this museum stuff.

00:07:45.606 --> 00:07:48.918
And for her, a museum is what
you do when you go on vacation

00:07:48.942 --> 00:07:50.909
and you tick-mark and it's over, right?

00:07:50.933 --> 00:07:53.464
And it took around four and a half years

00:07:53.488 --> 00:07:55.702
for me to convince my lovely Indian mother

00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:57.379
that actually, this is worthwhile.

00:07:57.403 --> 00:08:00.844
And the way I did it was,
I realized one day that she loves gold.

00:08:00.868 --> 00:08:06.443
So I started showing her all objects
that have the material gold in them.

00:08:06.467 --> 00:08:09.118
And the first thing my mom asks me is,

00:08:09.142 --> 00:08:11.570
"How can we buy these?"

00:08:11.594 --> 00:08:13.412
(Laughter)

00:08:13.436 --> 00:08:16.578
And obviously, my salary is not that high,

00:08:16.602 --> 00:08:18.980
so I was like, "We can't
actually do that, mom.

00:08:19.004 --> 00:08:21.115
But you can explore them virtually."

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:24.558
And so now my mom -- every time
I meet her, she asks me,

00:08:24.582 --> 00:08:28.048
"Any more gold, any more silver
in your project? Can you show me?"

00:08:28.072 --> 00:08:30.246
And that's the idea
I'm trying to illustrate.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.408
It does not matter how you get in,

00:08:32.432 --> 00:08:33.794
as long as you get in.

00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:35.428
Once you get in, you're hooked.

00:08:35.452 --> 00:08:37.801
Moving on from here very quickly,

00:08:37.825 --> 00:08:40.674
there is kind of a playful idea, actually,

00:08:40.698 --> 00:08:42.333
to illustrate the point of access,

00:08:42.357 --> 00:08:44.779
and I'm going to go
quite quickly on this one.

00:08:44.803 --> 00:08:50.210
We all know that seeing the artwork
in person is amazing.

00:08:50.234 --> 00:08:52.817
But we also know
that most of us can't do it,

00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:55.599
and the ones that can afford
to do it, it's complicated.

00:08:55.623 --> 00:08:59.430
So -- Cyril, can we load
up our art trip, what do we call it?

00:08:59.454 --> 00:09:01.216
We don't have a good name for this.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.211
But essentially, we have
around 1,000 amazing institutions,

00:09:06.235 --> 00:09:07.402
68 countries.

00:09:07.426 --> 00:09:09.126
But let's start with Rembrandt.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.392
We might have time for only one example.

00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:13.645
But thanks to the diversity,

00:09:13.669 --> 00:09:17.573
we've got around 500 amazing
Rembrandt object artworks

00:09:17.597 --> 00:09:19.866
from 46 institutions and 17 countries.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.442
Let's say that on your next vacation,

00:09:22.466 --> 00:09:24.516
you want to go see
every single one of them.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.874
That is your itinerary,

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:29.552
you will probably travel
53,000 kilometers,

00:09:29.576 --> 00:09:32.163
visit around, I think, 46 institutions,

00:09:32.187 --> 00:09:36.378
and just FYI, you might release
10 tons of CO2 emissions.

00:09:36.402 --> 00:09:37.865
(Laughter)

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:39.362
But remember, it's art,

00:09:39.386 --> 00:09:42.051
so you can justify it,
perhaps, in some way.

00:09:42.837 --> 00:09:44.759
Moving on swiftly from here,

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:47.718
is something a little bit
more technical and more interesting.

00:09:47.742 --> 00:09:52.679
All that we've shown you so far
uses metadata to make the connections.

00:09:52.703 --> 00:09:54.813
But obviously we have
something cool nowadays

00:09:54.837 --> 00:09:57.749
that everyone likes to talk about,
which is machine learning.

00:09:57.773 --> 00:10:00.847
So what we thought is,
let's strip out all the metadata,

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:04.483
let's look at what machine learning can do

00:10:04.507 --> 00:10:08.830
based purely on visual recognition
of this entire collection.

00:10:08.854 --> 00:10:13.047
What we ended up with
is this very interesting map,

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:17.381
these clusters that have
no reference point information,

00:10:17.405 --> 00:10:21.370
but has just used visuals
to cluster things together.

00:10:21.394 --> 00:10:24.976
Each cluster is an art to us
by itself of discovery.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.663
But one of the clusters we want
to show you very quickly

00:10:27.687 --> 00:10:30.339
is this amazing cluster of portraits

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:32.765
that we found from museums
around the world.

00:10:32.789 --> 00:10:34.972
If you could zoom in
a little bit more, Cyril.

00:10:34.996 --> 00:10:38.828
Just to show you, you can
just travel through portraits.

00:10:38.852 --> 00:10:41.626
And essentially, you can do nature,
you can do horses

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.406
and clusters galore.

00:10:44.309 --> 00:10:45.857
When we saw all these portraits,

00:10:45.881 --> 00:10:49.533
we were like, "Hey, can we do
something fun for kids,

00:10:49.557 --> 00:10:51.239
or can we do something playful

00:10:51.263 --> 00:10:53.288
to get people interested in portraits?"

00:10:53.312 --> 00:10:55.492
Because I haven't really seen

00:10:55.516 --> 00:10:58.883
young kids really excited
to go to a portrait gallery.

00:10:59.357 --> 00:11:01.289
I wanted to try to figure something out.

00:11:01.313 --> 00:11:03.780
So we created something
called the portrait matcher.

00:11:03.804 --> 00:11:05.121
It's quite self-explanatory,

00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:07.883
so I'm just going to let Cyril
show his beautiful face.

00:11:07.907 --> 00:11:12.039
And essentially what's happening is,
with the movement of his head,

00:11:12.063 --> 00:11:16.230
we are matching different portraits
around the world from museums.

00:11:16.254 --> 00:11:18.450
(Applause)

00:11:29.445 --> 00:11:31.151
And I don't know about you,

00:11:31.175 --> 00:11:33.191
but I've shown it to my nephew and sister,

00:11:33.215 --> 00:11:35.064
and the reaction is just phenomenal.

00:11:35.088 --> 00:11:37.794
All they ask me is,
"When can we go see this?"

00:11:39.492 --> 00:11:41.065
And by the way, if we're nice,

00:11:41.089 --> 00:11:43.910
maybe, Cyril, you can smile
and find a happy one?

00:11:44.696 --> 00:11:46.094
Oh, perfect.

00:11:46.118 --> 00:11:48.106
By the way, this is not rehearsed.

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:51.054
Congrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow.

00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:54.554
OK, let's move on; otherwise,
this will just take the whole time.

00:11:54.578 --> 00:11:56.296
(Applause)

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.900
So, art and culture
can be fun also, right?

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.297
For our last quick experiment --

00:12:03.321 --> 00:12:05.084
we call all of these "experiments" --

00:12:05.108 --> 00:12:07.997
our last quick experiment
comes back to machine learning.

00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:10.862
We show you clusters, visual clusters,

00:12:10.886 --> 00:12:15.787
but what if we could ask the machine
to also name these clusters?

00:12:15.811 --> 00:12:20.564
What if it could automatically tag
them, using no actual metadata?

00:12:20.588 --> 00:12:24.688
So what we have is this kind of explorer,

00:12:24.712 --> 00:12:28.323
where we have managed to match,
I think, around 4,000 labels.

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:31.511
And we haven't really
done anything special here,

00:12:31.535 --> 00:12:33.193
just fed the collection.

00:12:33.217 --> 00:12:34.987
And we found interesting categories.

00:12:35.011 --> 00:12:37.916
We can start with horses,
a very straightforward category.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.239
You would expect to see
that the machine has put

00:12:40.263 --> 00:12:42.004
images of horses, right?

00:12:42.028 --> 00:12:45.470
And it has, but you also notice,
right over there,

00:12:45.494 --> 00:12:47.573
that it has a very abstract image

00:12:47.597 --> 00:12:50.792
that it has still managed to recognize
and cluster as horses.

00:12:50.816 --> 00:12:54.506
We also have an amazing head
in terms of a horse.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.532
And each one has the tags
as to why it got categorized in this.

00:12:58.556 --> 00:13:02.530
So let's move to another one
which I found very funny and interesting,

00:13:02.554 --> 00:13:05.045
because I don't understand
how this category came up.

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:06.819
It's called "Lady in Waiting."

00:13:06.843 --> 00:13:09.455
If, Cyril, you do it very quickly,

00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:13.021
you will see that we have
these amazing images

00:13:13.045 --> 00:13:15.806
of ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.276
I don't really understand it.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.540
But I've been trying to ask
my museum contacts,

00:13:19.564 --> 00:13:21.809
you know, "What is this?
What's going on here?"

00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:23.445
And it's fascinating.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:26.158
Coming back to gold very quickly,

00:13:26.182 --> 00:13:27.745
I wanted to search for gold

00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:29.871
and see how the machine
tagged all the gold.

00:13:29.895 --> 00:13:31.975
But, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.835
We are living in popular times.

00:13:33.859 --> 00:13:35.962
It tags it as "bling-bling."

00:13:35.986 --> 00:13:37.800
(Laughter)

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.121
I'm being hard on Cyril,
because I'm moving too fast.

00:13:42.145 --> 00:13:44.772
Essentially, here you have
all the bling-bling

00:13:44.796 --> 00:13:47.957
of the world's museums organized for you.

00:13:47.981 --> 00:13:51.497
And finally, to end this talk
and these experiments,

00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:54.838
what I hope you feel after this talk
is happiness and emotion.

00:13:54.862 --> 00:13:57.301
And what would we see
when we see happiness?

00:13:57.325 --> 00:14:00.484
If we actually look at all the objects

00:14:00.508 --> 00:14:02.452
that have been tagged under "happiness,"

00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:05.540
you would expect happiness, I guess.

00:14:05.564 --> 00:14:11.667
But there was one that came up
that was very fascinating and interesting,

00:14:11.691 --> 00:14:16.066
which was this artwork
by Douglas Coupland,

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.185
our friend and artist
in residence as well,

00:14:18.209 --> 00:14:20.470
called, "I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain."

00:14:20.494 --> 00:14:24.109
I don't know why the machine feels like
it misses its pre-Internet brain

00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:25.403
and it's been tagged here,

00:14:25.427 --> 00:14:27.341
but it's a very interesting thought.

00:14:27.365 --> 00:14:29.548
I sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain,

00:14:29.572 --> 00:14:32.572
but not when it comes to exploring
arts and culture online.

00:14:32.596 --> 00:14:34.909
So take out your phones,
take out your computers,

00:14:34.933 --> 00:14:36.090
go visit museums.

00:14:36.114 --> 00:14:38.793
And just a quick call-out
to all the amazing archivists,

00:14:38.817 --> 00:14:40.201
historians, curators,

00:14:40.225 --> 00:14:42.997
who are sitting in museums,
preserving all this culture.

00:14:43.021 --> 00:14:46.339
And the least we can do is get
our daily dose of art and culture

00:14:46.363 --> 00:14:47.694
for ourselves and our kids.

00:14:47.718 --> 00:14:48.871
Thank you.

00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:59.536
(Applause)
