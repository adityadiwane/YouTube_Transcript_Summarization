00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
One day, Los Angeles Times columnist

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Steve Lopez was walking along

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
the streets of downtown Los Angeles

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
when he heard beautiful music.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And the source was a man,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
an African-American man,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.260
charming, rugged, homeless,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
playing a violin that only had two strings.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
And I'm telling a story that many of you know,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
because Steve's columns became the basis

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
for a book, which was turned into a movie,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
the Juilliard-trained double bassist

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
whose promising career was cut short

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and 30 years later he was living homeless

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.260
on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
to understand not only the beautiful bond

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
that formed between these two men,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
but how music helped shape that bond,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun --

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
in helping Nathaniel get off the streets.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
and came backstage and introduced himself.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
all because of the treacherous first violin passage work

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.260
in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.260
saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
because when he was treated it was with shock therapy

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and Thorazine and handcuffs,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
But as a result now, he is prone to

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
these schizophrenic episodes,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
the worst of which can manifest themselves as

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
him exploding

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
and then disappearing for days,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
wandering the streets of Skid Row,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.260
exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
unleashed upon him.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall --

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
he was lost.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And he was talking about

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
invisible demons and smoke,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.260
and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
And I was afraid,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
not for myself, but I was afraid

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
that I was going to lose him,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
that he was going to sink into one of his states,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
if I started talking about scales

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and arpeggios and other exciting forms of

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
didactic violin pedagogy.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.260
(Laughter)

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
So, I just started playing.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And as I played,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
I understood that there was a profound change

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
occurring in Nathaniel's eyes.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.260
a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
was its catalyst.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And Nathaniel's manic rage

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.260
was transformed into understanding,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.260
a quiet curiosity and grace.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
and he started playing, by ear,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
certain snippets of violin concertos

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
And we started talking about music, from Bach

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
to Beethoven and Brahms,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
Bruckner, all the B's,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
from BartÃ³k, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And I understood that he not only

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
had an encyclopedic knowledge of music,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.260
but he related to this music at a personal level.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
He spoke about it with the kind of passion

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
and understanding that I share with my colleagues

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
And through playing music and talking about music,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
this man had transformed

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
from the paranoid, disturbed man

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
that had just come from walking the streets

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
of downtown Los Angeles

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
to the charming, erudite,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.260
brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Music is medicine. Music changes us.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Because music allows him to take his thoughts

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
and delusions and shape them

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
through his imagination and his creativity,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
into reality.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And that is an escape

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
from his tormented state.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And I understood that this was the very essence of art.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
This was the very reason why we made music,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
that we take something that exists within all of us

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
at our very fundamental core,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
our emotions,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and through our artistic lens,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.260
through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
And the reality of that expression

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
reaches all of us

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.260
and moves us, inspires and unites us.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
And for Nathaniel,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
music brought him back into a fold of friends.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
The redemptive power of music brought him back

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
into a family of musicians

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
that understood him,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
that recognized his talents

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
and respected him.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And I will always make music with Nathaniel,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
or on Skid Row, because he reminds me

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
why I became a musician.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Thank you.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:58.260
(Applause)

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Robert Gupta.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
(Applause)

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
So, please forgive me.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.260
(Laughter)

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
(Music)

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:21.260
(Applause)
