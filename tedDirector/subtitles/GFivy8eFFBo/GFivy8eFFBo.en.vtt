00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
One morning, in the year 1957,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
saw himself like this,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
a weird freak with huge hands,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
huge mouth,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and a tiny bottom.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Actually this creature

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
is the result of the Penfield research.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
He named it homunculus.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Basically the homunculus is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
the visualization of a human being

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
where each part of the body is proportional

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
to the surface it takes in the brain.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.260
So, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
It's you. It's me.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
It's our invisible reality.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
This visualization could explain, for example,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
why newborns, or smokers,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
put, instinctively, their fingers in the mouth.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Unfortunately it doesn't explain why

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
so many designers remain mainly interested

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
in designing chairs.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
So anyway, even if I do not understand science entirely,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
for my design I essentially refer to it.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
I'm fascinated by its ability to

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
deeply investigate the human being,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
its way of working, its way of feeling.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
And it really helps me to understand

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
how we see, how we hear,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.260
how we breathe, how our brain can inform or mislead us.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
It's a great tool for me

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.260
to understand what could be our real needs.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.260
Marketing people have never been able to do that.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Marketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Marketing creates user groups.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And scientists, amidst complexity,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
amidst fluctuation and uniqueness.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
What could be our real needs?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Maybe the silence.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
In our daily life we are continuously disturbed by

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
aggressive sounds.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And you know all those kind of sound puts us

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
in a kind of stressful state,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
and prevent us from being quiet and focused.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
So I wanted to create a kind of

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
sound filter,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
But I didn't want it to make it by

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
isolating people, without any earmuffs

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
or those kind of things.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Or neither with including complex technology.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.260
I just wanted to, using the complexity

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
and the technology of the brain, of the human brain.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
So I worked with white noise.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
dB is basically --

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
dB is the name of the product,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
basically a white noise diffuser.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.260
This is white noise.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
The white noise is the sum of all frequencies

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
that are audible by the human being,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
brought to the same intensity.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And this noise is like a "shhhhhhhhhhhhh," like that.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And this noise is the most neutral.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
So when you hear this sound

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
you feel like a kind of shelter,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
preserved from noise pollution.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And when you hear the white noise, your brain is immediately focused on it.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.260
And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
It seems to be magic.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
But it is just physiology. It's just in your brain.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And in mine, I hope.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
So in order to make this white noise

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
a little bit active and reactive,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
I create a ball, a rolling ball

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.260
able to analyze and find

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
where does aggressive sound come from,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
and roll, at home or at work,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
towards aggressive noise,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and emits white noise in order to neutralize it.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
(Laughter)

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
It works.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.260
You feel the effect of the white noise?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
It's too in silence.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
If you make some noise you can feel the effect.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
So even if this object,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
even if this product includes some technology,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
it includes some speakers, it includes some microphones

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
and some electronic devices,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
this object is not a very smart object.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
And I don't want to make a very smart object.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.260
I don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
I want to create an object like you and me.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
So, definitely not perfect.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
So imagine, for instance, you are at home.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
You shout. You say, "Blah blah blah, Blah blah blah. Who is this guy?"

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And dB will probably roll toward you.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.260
And turning around you is "shhhhhhh," like that.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.260
(Laughter)

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Definitely not perfect. So you would probably

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
shut it, at this point.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
(Laughter)

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Anyway, in this same kind of approach,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
I designed K.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
K is a daylight receiver transmitter.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
So this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
or on your piano, where you are supposed

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
to spend most of your time in the day.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
And this object will be

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.260
and able to give you the quantity of light you need.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
This object is completely covered by

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
fiber opticals.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
but creates the idea of an

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
eye sensibility of the object.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
I want, by this design

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
feel, when you see it,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
you see, instinctively,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
this object seems to be very sensitive,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
very reactive.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And this object knows, better than you

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
and probably before you, what you really need.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
You have to know that the lack of daylight

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
can provoke some

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
problem of energy, or problem of libido.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
So, a huge problem.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.260
(Laughter)

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Most of the projects I work on --

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
I live in collaboration with scientists.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
I'm just a designer. So I need them.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
So there can be some biologists,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
psychiatrists, mathematicians, and so on.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And I submit them, my intuitions,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
my hypothesis, my first ideas.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
And they react. They told me what is possible, what is impossible.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.260
And together we improve the original concept.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
And we build the project to the end.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
And this kind of relationship between designer and scientist

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
started when I was at school.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Indeed in my studies I was a guinea pig

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
for a pharmaceutical industry.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
And the irony for me was

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
of course, I didn't do that for the sake of science progress.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
I just do that to make money.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Anyway, this project, or this experience,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.260
make me start a new project on the design of medicine.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.260
You have to know that today, roughly one or two every drug pills

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
is not taken correctly.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.260
So even if the active constituents

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
in pharmaceuticals made constant progress

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
in terms of chemistry, target of stability,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
the behavior of the patients

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
goes more and more unstable.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
So we took too many of them.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
We took irregular dosage.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
We do not follow instructions. And so on.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
So I wanted to create a

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
new kind of medicine,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
in order to create a new kind of relationship

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
between the patient and the treatment.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
So I turned traditional pills into this.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
I'm going to give you some example.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
This one is an antibiotic.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
And its purpose is to help patient

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
to go to the end of the treatment.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
And the concept is to

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
create a kind of onion,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
a kind of structure in layers.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
So, you start with the darkest one.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.260
And you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.260
So the first day, this is the big one.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.260
And you have to peel and eat one layer a day.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
And your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.260
And you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.260
And you follow the treatment like that,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
to the end of the treatment.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
And here you can get the white core.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.260
And it means, right, you are in the recovery.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
(Applause) Thank you.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
This one is a "third lung,"

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.260
a pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.260
I designed it to help kids to follow the treatment.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
So the idea of this one is to create

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
a relationship between the patient of the treatment

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
but a relationship of dependency.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.260
But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.260
This is, the kids will feel

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
the therapeutic object needs him.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
So the idea is, all night long

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
the elastic skin of the third lung

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
will slowly inflate itself,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
including air and molecules, for sure.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
And when the kids wake up,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
he can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
and breathe the air it contains.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
So by this way,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.260
the kid, to take care of himself,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
is to take care of this living object.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
And he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
as the asthma treatment needs him.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.260
(Applause)

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.260
In this guise of living object approach,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
I like the idea of a kind of invisible design,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.260
as if the function of the object

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
exists in a kind of invisible field

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
just around the objects themselves.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
We could talk about a kind of soul,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
of a ghost accompanying them.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.260
And almost a kind of poltergeist effect.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
So when a passive object like this one seems to be alive,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
because it is -- woosh -- starting to move.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
And I remember an exhibition design

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
I made for John Maeda,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
and for the Fondation Cartier in Paris.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
And John Maeda was supposed to show

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
several graphic animations in this exhibition.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And my idea for this exhibition design was to create

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
a real pong game, like this one.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
And the idea was to create some self-moving benches

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
in the main exhibition room.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
So the living benches would be exactly like the ball.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.260
And John was so excited by this idea. He said to me, "Okay let's go."

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
I remember the day of the opening.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
I was a little bit late.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:03.260
When I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.260
in the exhibition room, John was just beside me,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and was like, "Hmm. Hmm."

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
And he told me, after a long silence,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
"I wonder, Mathieu, if

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
people won't be more fascinated by your benches

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
than by my videos."

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
(Laughter)

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
It would be a great honor, a great compliment for me,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
if he hadn't decided to take all them off

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
two hours before the opening.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
So, huge tragedy.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
I guess you won't be surprised if I tell you

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
that Pinocchio is one of my great influences.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Pinocchio is probably one of my best design products, my favorite one.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
Because it is a kind of object with a conscience,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
able to be modified by its surroundings,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and able to modify it as well.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
The other great influence is the mine's canary.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.260
In coal mines, this canary

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
was supposed to be close to the miners.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
And it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.260
So this canary was a living alarm,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
and a very efficient one.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
A very natural technology,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
in order to say to the miners,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.260
"The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency."

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
So it's, for me, a great product.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
And I tried to design a kind of canary.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
Andrea is one.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.260
from air, contaminated indoor air.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
So it uses some plants to do this job,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:43.260
selected for their gas-filtering ability.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
You have to know, or you probably already know,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
So while I'm talking to you,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.260
invisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that. (Laughter)

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.260
So you are currently breathing formaldehyde.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
It's the same for me with the carpet.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.260
And this is exactly the same at home.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.260
Because all the product we get constantly give away

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
the volatile component of which they're made of.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
So let's have a look at your home.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
So your sofa, your plastic chair,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
your kid's toys

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.260
give their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
This is the reason why

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
I created, with David Edward,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
a scientist of Harvard University,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:56.260
an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
But the idea is to force

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
the air to go in the effective part of the plants.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
Because the roots of the plant are not very effective.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
Bill Wolverton from NASA

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:10.260
analyzed it cleverly in the '70s.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
So the idea is to create an object

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:16.260
able to force the air, and to be in contact at the right speed

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.260
at the right place, in all the effective parts of the plant.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
So this is the final object.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.260
It will be launched next September.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
(Applause)

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
This one is kind of the same approach

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
because I include, in a product

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
like Andrea, some plants.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.260
And in this one, plants are used for the water filtration ability.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
And it includes some fishes as well.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
But here, unlike Andrea,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
here are supposed to be eaten.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
Indeed, this object is a domestic farm,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
for fishes and green.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
So the idea of this object

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
is to be able to get at home

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
very local food.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
The locavores

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
used to get food

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
taken in a radius of 100 miles.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
Local River is able to provide you

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
food directly in your living room.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
So the principle of this object

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
is to create an ecosystem

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
called aquaponics.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.260
And the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
by a water pump, feeds the plants above.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
And the plants will filter, by the roots,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
the dirty water of the fish.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.260
After, it goes back into the fish tank.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
After that you have two options.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
Or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
Amazing channel.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
Or you start fishing.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
And you make some sushis with a fish

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
and the aromatic plants above.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
Because you can grow some potatoes.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
No, not potatoes, but tomatoes,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
aromatic plants and so on.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
So now we can breathe safely.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Now we can eat local food.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Now we can be treated by smart medicine.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
Now we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
with daylight.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
But it was important to create a perfect place,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
so I tried to,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
in order to work and create.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.260
So I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
a very stimulative, brain-stimulative office.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
I wanted to create a perfect place

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
where you can work and play,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
and where your body and your brain can work together.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
So, in this office,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.260
you do not work anymore at your desk, like a politician.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.260
Your seat, your sleep and your play

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:45.260
on a big geodesic island made of leather.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
See, like this one?

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:52.260
In this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:57.260
but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave,

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
like a prehistoric scientist.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.260
So you, like that, can make some sport during your work.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.260
In this office

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
you do not need to go out

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
in order to be in contact with nature.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:17.260
You include, directly, the nature in the floor of the office.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
You can see it there.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
This is an inspiration image

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
to lead this project of the office.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
It really helped me to design it.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
I never show it to my client. He would be so afraid.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.260
(Laughter)

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
Just for my workshop.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.260
I guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig I was.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.260
But it's maybe the conviction

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.260
as monkey and homunculus we are.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:51.260
All of us need to be considered according to our real nature.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:58.260
(Applause)
