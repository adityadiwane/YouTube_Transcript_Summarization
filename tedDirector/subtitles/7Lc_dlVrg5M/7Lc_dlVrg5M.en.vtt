00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.256
In case you are wondering,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.880
no, I'm not wearing a dress,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.160
and no, I'm not saying
what I'm wearing underneath.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.296
(Laughter)

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.240
This is a gho.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.360
This is my national dress.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.960
This is how all men dress in Bhutan.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.200
That is how our women dress.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.496
Like our women,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.600
we men get to wear pretty bright colors,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.240
but unlike our women,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.816
we get to show off our legs.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.856
(Laughter)

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.296
Our national dress is unique,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.520
but this is not the only thing
that's unique about my country.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.176
Our promise to remain
carbon neutral is also unique,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.416
and this is what I'd like
to speak about today,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.800
our promise to remain carbon neutral.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.680
But before I proceed,
I should set you the context.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.160
I should tell you our story.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.240
Bhutan is a small country
in the Himalayas.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.296
We've been called Shangri-La,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.000
even the last Shangri-La.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.456
But let me tell you right off the bat,
we are not Shangri-La.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.216
My country is not one big monastery

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.896
populated with happy monks.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.576
(Laughter)

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.296
The reality is that
there are barely 700,000 of us

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.256
sandwiched between two
of the most populated countries on earth,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.440
China and India.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.536
The reality is that we are a small,
underdeveloped country

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.360
doing our best to survive.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.400
But we are doing OK. We are surviving.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.120
In fact, we are thriving,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.360
and the reason we are thriving
is because we've been blessed

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.096
with extraordinary kings.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.136
Our enlightened monarchs
have worked tirelessly

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.016
to develop our country,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.616
balancing economic growth carefully

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.536
with social development,
environmental sustainability

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.416
and cultural preservation,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.919
all within the framework
of good governance.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.056
We call this holistic approach
to development

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.800
"Gross National Happiness," or GNH.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.456
Back in the 1970s,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.016
our fourth king famously
pronounced that for Bhutan,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.576
Gross National Happiness is more important
than Gross National Product.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.480
(Applause)

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.600
Ever since,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.080
all development in Bhutan
is driven by GNH,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.976
a pioneering vision
that aims to improve the happiness

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.840
and well-being of our people.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.936
But that's easier said than done,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.880
especially when you are one
of the smallest economies in the world.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.680
Our entire GDP is less
than two billion dollars.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.416
I know that some of you here
are worth more --

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.696
(Laughter)

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.256
individually

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.760
than the entire economy of my country.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.856
So our economy is small,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.690
but here is where it gets interesting.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.760
Education is completely free.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.416
All citizens are guaranteed
free school education,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.416
and those that work hard
are given free college education.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.896
Healthcare is also completely free.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.976
Medical consultation,
medical treatment, medicines:

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.880
they are all provided by the state.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.640
We manage this

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.720
because we use our limited
resources very carefully,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.256
and because we stay faithful
to the core mission of GNH,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.080
which is development with values.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.496
Our economy is small,
and we must strengthen it.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.696
Economic growth is important,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.856
but that economic growth must not come
from undermining our unique culture

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.960
or our pristine environment.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.360
Today, our culture is flourishing.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.776
We continue to celebrate
our art and architecture,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.400
food and festivals,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.960
monks and monasteries.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.640
And yes, we celebrate
our national dress, too.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.000
This is why I can wear my gho with pride.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.440
Here's a fun fact:

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.120
you're looking
at the world's biggest pocket.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.096
(Laughter)

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.136
It starts here,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.336
goes around the back,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.840
and comes out from inside here.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.896
In this pocket

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.936
we store all manner of personal goods

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.880
from phones and wallets

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.296
to iPads, office files and books.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.536
(Laughter)

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.256
(Applause)

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.816
But sometimes --

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.840
sometimes even precious cargo.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.800
So our culture is flourishing,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.016
but so is our environment.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.440
72 percent of my country
is under forest cover.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.416
Our constitution demands
that a minimum of 60 percent

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.136
of Bhutan's total land
shall remain under forest cover

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.376
for all time.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.920
(Applause)

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.600
Our constitution,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.800
this constitution,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.240
imposes forest cover on us.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.096
Incidentally, our king
used this constitution

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.880
to impose democracy on us.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.816
You see, we the people
didn't want democracy.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.816
We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it,

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.640
and we certainly didn't fight for it.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.976
Instead, our king imposed democracy on us

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.840
by insisting that he include it
in the constitution.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.760
But he went further.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.120
He included provisions in the constitution

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.360
that empower the people
to impeach their kings,

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.616
and included provisions in here
that require all our kings to retire

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.080
at the age of 65.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.896
(Applause)

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.240
Fact is, we already have
a king in retirement:

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.136
our previous king, the Great Fourth,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.616
retired 10 years ago

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.920
at the peak of his popularity.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.680
He was all of 51 years at that time.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.400
So as I was saying,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.896
72 percent of our country
is under forest cover,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.160
and all that forest is pristine.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.096
That's why we are one of the few remaining

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.136
global biodiversity hotspots in the world,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.520
and that's why we are
a carbon neutral country.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.696
In a world that is threatened
with climate change,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.640
we are a carbon neutral country.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.240
Turns out, it's a big deal.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.296
Of the 200-odd countries
in the world today,

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.080
it looks like we are the only one

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.800
that's carbon neutral.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.480
Actually, that's not quite accurate.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.880
Bhutan is not carbon neutral.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.240
Bhutan is carbon negative.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:42.536
Our entire country generates
2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.400
but our forests, they sequester
more than three times that amount,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.856
so we are a net carbon sink

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.800
for more than four million tons
of carbon dioxide each year.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.416
But that's not all.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.536
(Applause)

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.656
We export most
of the renewable electricity

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.840
we generate from our fast-flowing rivers.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.576
So today, the clean energy that we export

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.680
offsets about six million tons
of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.176
By 2020, we'll be exporting
enough electricity

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.880
to offset 17 million tons
of carbon dioxide.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.936
And if we were to harness
even half our hydropower potential,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.000
and that's exactly what we are working at,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.496
the clean, green energy that we export

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.640
would offset something like
50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:44.200
That is more CO2 than what the entire city
of New York generates in one year.

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:48.256
So inside our country,
we are a net carbon sink.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.816
Outside, we are offsetting carbon.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.200
And this is important stuff.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.039
You see, the world is getting warmer,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.120
and climate change is a reality.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.680
Climate change is affecting my country.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.720
Our glaciers are melting,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.856
causing flash floods and landslides,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.320
which in turn are causing disaster
and widespread destruction in our country.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.200
I was at that lake recently.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.000
It's stunning.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.216
That's how it looked 10 years ago,

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.840
and that's how it looked 20 years ago.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.160
Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.680
It was a solid glacier.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.560
A few years ago, a similar lake

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.160
breached its dams

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.160
and wreaked havoc in the valleys below.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.376
That destruction
was caused by one glacier lake.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.320
We have 2,700 of them to contend with.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.880
The point is this:

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.616
my country and my people have done nothing

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.520
to contribute to global warming,

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.040
but we are already bearing the brunt
of its consequences.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.576
And for a small, poor country,
one that is landlocked and mountainous,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.360
it is very difficult.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.936
But we are not going to sit
on our hands doing nothing.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.360
We will fight climate change.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.480
That's why we have promised
to remain carbon neutral.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.816
We first made this promise in 2009

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.600
during COP 15 in Copenhagen,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.000
but nobody noticed.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.616
Governments were so busy
arguing with one another

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.576
and blaming each other
for causing climate change,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.256
that when a small country
raised our hands and announced,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.376
"We promise to remain
carbon neutral for all time,"

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.600
nobody heard us.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.080
Nobody cared.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.200
Last December in Paris,

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.736
at COP 21, we reiterated our promise

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.320
to remain carbon neutral
for all time to come.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.080
This time, we were heard.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.280
We were noticed, and everybody cared.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.136
What was different in Paris
was that governments came round together

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.776
to accept the realities of climate change,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.160
and were willing to come together
and act together and work together.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.160
All countries, from the very small
to the very large,

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.360
committed to reduce
the greenhouse gas emissions.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.776
The UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.560
says that if these so-called
intended commitments are kept,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.616
we'd be closer
to containing global warming

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.000
by two degrees Celsius.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.640
By the way,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.376
I've requested the TED organizers here

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.280
to turn up the heat in here
by two degrees,

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.336
so if some of you
are feeling warmer than usual,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.560
you know who to blame.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.160
It's crucial that all of us
keep our commitments.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.056
As far as Bhutan is concerned,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.520
we will keep our promise
to remain carbon neutral.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.600
Here are some of the ways we are doing it.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.600
We are providing free electricity
to our rural farmers.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:26.536
The idea is that, with free electricity,
they will no longer have to use firewood

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.760
to cook their food.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.336
We are investing in sustainable transport

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.816
and subsidizing the purchase
of electric vehicles.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.976
Similarly, we are subsidizing
the cost of LED lights,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.296
and our entire government
is trying to go paperless.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.816
We are cleaning up our entire country
through Clean Bhutan, a national program,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.976
and we are planting trees
throughout our country

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.440
through Green Bhutan,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.280
another national program.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.496
But it is our protected areas

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.840
that are at the core
of our carbon neutral strategy.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.536
Our protected areas are our carbon sink.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.360
They are our lungs.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.376
Today, more than half
our country is protected,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.776
as national parks, nature reserves

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.720
and wildlife sanctuaries.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.496
But the beauty is that we've connected
them all with one another

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.440
through a network of biological corridors.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.376
Now, what this means

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.320
is that our animals are free
to roam throughout our country.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.176
Take this tiger, for example.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.896
It was spotted
at 250 meters above sea level

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.240
in the hot, subtropical jungles.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.016
Two years later, that same tiger

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.536
was spotted near 4,000 meters

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.080
in our cold alpine mountains.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.040
Isn't that awesome?

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.776
(Applause)

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.640
We must keep it that way.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.560
We must keep our parks awesome.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.536
So every year, we set aside resources
to prevent poaching, hunting,

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.936
mining and pollution in our parks,

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:16.096
and resources to help communities
who live in those parks

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.616
manage their forests,

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.096
adapt to climate change,

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.120
and lead better lives while continuing
to live in harmony with Mother Nature.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.840
But that is expensive.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:32.376
Over the next few years,
our small economy won't have the resources

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.120
to cover all the costs that are required
to protect our environment.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.176
In fact, when we run the numbers,

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.896
it looks like it'll take us
at least 15 years

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.080
before we can fully finance
all our conservation efforts.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.520
But neither Bhutan,

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.920
nor the world

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.640
can afford to spend 15 years
going backwards.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.840
This is why His Majesty the King

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.360
started Bhutan For Life.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.896
Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.320
It gives us breathing room.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.496
It is essentially a funding mechanism

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.456
to look after our parks,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.920
to protect our parks,

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.560
until our government
can take over on our own fully.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.496
The idea is to raise a transition fund

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.840
from individual donors,
corporations and institutions,

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.376
but the deal is closed only
after predetermined conditions are met

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.000
and all funds committed.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.840
So multiparty, single closing:

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.520
an idea we borrowed from Wall Street.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.976
This means that individual donors
can commit without having to worry

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.960
that they'll be left
supporting an underfunded plan.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.736
It's something like a Kickstarter project,

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.136
only with a 15-year time horizon

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.480
and millions of tons
of carbon dioxide at stake.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.120
Once the deal is closed,

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.376
we use the transition fund
to protect our parks,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.576
giving our government time
to increase our own funding gradually

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.616
until the end of the 15-year period.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:18.200
After that, our government
guarantees full funding forever.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.320
We are almost there.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.640
We expect to close later this year.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.336
Naturally, I'm pretty excited.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.000
(Applause)

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:38.320
The World Wildlife Fund
is our principle partner in this journey,

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.016
and I want to give them a big shoutout

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.360
for the excellent work
they are doing in Bhutan

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.416
and across the world.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.016
(Applause)

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.000
Whew, it is getting warm in here.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.320
I thank you for listening to our story,

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.656
a story of how we are keeping
our promise to remain carbon neutral,

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.400
a story of how we are keeping
our country pristine,

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.040
for ourselves, our children,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.839
for your children and for the world.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.640
But we are not here
to tell stories, are we?

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.400
We are here to dream together.

00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:33.079
So in closing, I'd like to share
one more dream that I have.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.816
What if we could mobilize
our leadership and our resources,

00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:40.496
our influence and our passion,

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.816
to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea
to other countries

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.280
so that they too

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.920
can conserve their
protected areas for all time.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.922
After all, there are many other countries
who face the same issues that we face.

00:17:53.946 --> 00:17:56.136
They too have natural resources

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.080
that can help win the world's fight
for sustainability,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.056
only they may not have the ability
to invest in them now.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.520
So what if we set up Earth For Life,

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.200
a global fund, to kickstart
the Bhutan For Life throughout the world?

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.800
I invite you to help me,

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.176
to carry this dream beyond our borders

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.640
to all those who care
about our planet's future.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.160
After all, we're here to dream together,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.776
to work together,

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.400
to fight climate change together,
to protect our planet together.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.840
Because the reality is

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.680
we are in it together.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.800
Some of us might dress differently,

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.760
but we are in it together.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.000
Thank you very much,

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.216
and kadrin chhe la. Thank you.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.856
(Applause)

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.520
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
