00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:16.389
In the great 1980s movie 
"The Blues Brothers,"

00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:21.183
there's a scene where John Belushi
goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment

00:00:21.183 --> 00:00:23.506
in Chicago for the very first time.

00:00:24.106 --> 00:00:26.637
It's a cramped, tiny space

00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:29.168
and it's just three feet away
from the train tracks.

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:32.466
As John sits on Dan's bed,

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.929
a train goes rushing by,

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:37.153
rattling everything in the room.

00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:40.982
John asks, "How often does
that train go by?"

00:00:40.982 --> 00:00:45.542
Dan replies, "So often, you won't
even notice it."

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:48.448
And then, something falls off the wall.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:51.042
We all know what he's talking about.

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:53.883
As human beings, we get used
to everyday things

00:00:53.883 --> 00:00:55.080
really fast.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.984
As a product designer,
it's my job to see those everyday things,

00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:02.521
to feel them, and try
to improve upon them.

00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:06.861
For example, see this piece of fruit?

00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:09.811
See this little sticker?

00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:13.666
That sticker wasn't there
when I was a kid.

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:16.694
But somewhere as the years passed,

00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:19.575
someone had the bright idea
to put that sticker on the fruit.

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:20.292
Why?

00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:21.821
So it could be easier for us 

00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:23.558
to check out 
at the grocery counter.

00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:24.651
Well that's great,

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.706
we can get in and out of
the store quickly.

00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:28.784
But now, there's a new problem.

00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:31.443
When we get home and we're hungry

00:01:31.443 --> 00:01:34.874
and we see this ripe, juicy piece
of fruit on the counter,

00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:37.719
we just want to pick it up
and eat it.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.455
Except now, we have to look
for this little sticker.

00:01:42.587 --> 00:01:46.961
And dig at it with our nails,
damaging the flesh.

00:01:46.962 --> 00:01:48.601
Then rolling up that sticker --

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:49.636
you know what I mean.

00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:51.775
And then trying to flick
it off your fingers.

00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:55.136
(Applause)

00:01:56.276 --> 00:01:57.776
It's not fun,

00:01:57.776 --> 00:01:58.797
not at all.

00:01:59.777 --> 00:02:01.682
But something interesting happened.

00:02:01.992 --> 00:02:05.073
See the first time you did it,
you probably felt those feelings.

00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:07.280
You just wanted to eat the piece of fruit.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.287
You felt upset.

00:02:08.287 --> 00:02:10.021
You just wanted to dive in.

00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:12.165
By the 10th time,

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.641
you started to become less upset

00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:18.071
and you just started peeling
the label off.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.480
By the 100th time,
at least for me,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.612
I became numb to it.

00:02:22.212 --> 00:02:25.103
I simply picked up the piece of fruit,

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:29.215
dug at it with my nails,
tried to flick it off,

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.771
and then wondered,

00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:34.270
"Was there another sticker?"

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.974
So why is that?

00:02:36.974 --> 00:02:39.126
Why do we get used to everyday things?

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:42.274
Well as human beings,
we have limited brain power.

00:02:42.274 --> 00:02:47.043
And so our brains encode the 
everyday things we do into habits

00:02:47.043 --> 00:02:50.620
so we can free up space 
to learn new things.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.662
It's a process called habituation

00:02:52.662 --> 00:02:56.266
and it's one of the most basic ways,
as humans, we learn.

00:02:57.596 --> 00:02:59.765
Now, habituation isn't always bad.

00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:02.611
Remember learning to drive?

00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:04.279
I sure do.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.227
Your hands clenched at 10 and 2
on the wheel,

00:03:08.227 --> 00:03:10.445
looking at every single
object out there --

00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:13.695
the cars, the lights, the pedestrians.

00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:16.006
It's a nerve-wracking experience.

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:20.520
So much so, that I couldn't even
talk to anyone else in the car

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.450
and I couldn't even listen to music.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.949
But then something interesting happened.

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:29.119
As the weeks went by,
driving became easier and easier.

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:31.647
You habituated it.

00:03:32.647 --> 00:03:34.914
It started to become 
fun and second nature.

00:03:35.324 --> 00:03:37.531
And then, you could talk 
to your friends again

00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:38.490
and listen to music.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.189
So there's a good reason why
our brains habituate things.

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.552
If we didn't, we'd notice
every little detail,

00:03:44.552 --> 00:03:46.167
all the time.

00:03:46.717 --> 00:03:48.295
It would be exhausting,

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:50.687
and we'd have no time
to learn about new things.

00:03:52.317 --> 00:03:55.457
But sometimes,
habituation isn't good.

00:03:56.477 --> 00:03:59.812
If it stops us from noticing 
the problems that are around us,

00:03:59.812 --> 00:04:00.843
well, that's bad.

00:04:01.413 --> 00:04:04.816
And if it stops us from noticing 
and fixing those problems,

00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:06.933
well, then that's really bad.

00:04:07.923 --> 00:04:09.906
Comedians know all about this.

00:04:09.906 --> 00:04:14.791
Jerry Seinfeld's entire career was built
on noticing those little details,

00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:18.769
those idiotic things we do every day
that we don't even remember.

00:04:20.238 --> 00:04:22.615
He tells us about the time 
he visited his friends

00:04:22.615 --> 00:04:25.001
and he just wanted to take 
a comfortable shower.

00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:28.898
He'd reach out and grab the handle
and turn it slightly one way,

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.483
and it was 100 degrees too hot.

00:04:31.483 --> 00:04:35.415
And then he'd turn it the other way,
and it was 100 degrees too cold.

00:04:35.415 --> 00:04:37.778
He just wanted a comfortable shower.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:39.941
Now, we've all been there,

00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:41.726
we just don't remember it.

00:04:41.726 --> 00:04:43.048
But Jerry did,

00:04:43.048 --> 00:04:45.062
and that's a comedian's job.

00:04:45.062 --> 00:04:48.182
But designers, innovators 
and entrepreneurs,

00:04:48.182 --> 00:04:50.589
it's our job to not just notice
those things,

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:53.525
but to go one step further
and try to fix them.

00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:56.842
See this, this person,

00:04:56.842 --> 00:04:58.311
this is Mary Anderson.

00:04:58.581 --> 00:05:00.778
In 1902 in New York City,

00:05:00.778 --> 00:05:02.606
she was visiting.

00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:07.834
It was a cold, wet, snowy day
and she was warm inside a streetcar.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:14.323
As she was going to her destination,
she noticed the driver opening the window

00:05:14.323 --> 00:05:19.128
to clean off the excess snow
so he could drive safely.

00:05:20.258 --> 00:05:23.834
When he opened the window, though,
he let all this cold, wet air inside,

00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:25.779
making all the passengers miserable.

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:30.122
Now probably, most of those 
passengers just thought,

00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:33.373
"It's a fact of life, he's got
to open the window to clean it.

00:05:33.373 --> 00:05:34.766
That's just how it is."

00:05:35.176 --> 00:05:36.711
But Mary didn't.

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.010
Mary thought,

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.844
"What if the diver could actually clean
the windshield from the inside

00:05:41.844 --> 00:05:45.122
so that he could stay safe and drive

00:05:45.122 --> 00:05:48.063
and the passengers could 
actually stay warm?"

00:05:48.603 --> 00:05:51.355
So she picked up her sketchbook
right then and there,

00:05:51.355 --> 00:05:55.716
and began drawing what would become
the world's first windshield wiper.

00:05:56.924 --> 00:06:01.194
Now as a product designer,
I try to learn from people like Mary

00:06:01.198 --> 00:06:03.963
to try to see the world 
the way it really is,

00:06:03.973 --> 00:06:06.047
not the way we think it is.

00:06:06.587 --> 00:06:07.534
Why?

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.881
Because it's easy to solve a problem
that almost everyone sees.

00:06:11.894 --> 00:06:15.674
But it's hard to solve a problem
that almost no one sees.

00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:19.169
Now some people think
you're born with this ability

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:20.750
or you're not,

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.693
as if Mary Anderson was hardwired at birth
to see the world more clearly.

00:06:26.883 --> 00:06:28.813
That wasn't the case for me.

00:06:28.813 --> 00:06:30.456
I had to work at it.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:34.395
During my years at Apple,

00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:39.142
Steve Jobs challenged us
to come into work every day,

00:06:39.142 --> 00:06:43.056
to see our products through 
the eyes of the customer,

00:06:43.056 --> 00:06:44.503
the new customer,

00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:47.689
the one that has fears 
and possible frustrations

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:50.830
and hopeful exhilaration that their
new technology product

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.851
could work straightaway for them.

00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:55.705
He called it staying beginners,

00:06:55.705 --> 00:06:59.687
and wanted to make sure that we
focused on those tiny little details

00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:03.845
to make them faster, easier and seamless
for the new customers.

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:08.805
So I remember this clearly
in the very earliest days of the iPod.

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:10.698
See, back in the '90s,

00:07:10.698 --> 00:07:13.127
being a gadget freak like I am,

00:07:15.107 --> 00:07:20.002
I would rush out to the store
for the very, very latest gadget.

00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:23.353
I'd take all the time to get to the store,

00:07:23.353 --> 00:07:26.964
I'd check out, I'd come back home,
I'd start to unbox it.

00:07:26.964 --> 00:07:30.890
And then, there was 
another little sticker:

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.005
the one that said, "Charge before use."

00:07:34.005 --> 00:07:35.553
What!

00:07:35.553 --> 00:07:36.558
I can't believe it!

00:07:36.558 --> 00:07:38.734
I just spent all this time
buying this product

00:07:38.734 --> 00:07:40.768
and now I have to charge before use.

00:07:40.768 --> 00:07:45.158
I have to wait what felt like an eternity
to use that coveted new toy.

00:07:45.158 --> 00:07:46.850
It was crazy.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.755
But you know what?

00:07:47.755 --> 00:07:49.838
Almost every product back then did that.

00:07:49.838 --> 00:07:51.613
When it had batteries in it,

00:07:51.613 --> 00:07:53.890
you had to charge it
before you used it.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.136
Well, Steve noticed that

00:07:57.136 --> 00:07:57.967
and he said,

00:07:57.967 --> 00:08:00.565
"We're not going to let that 
happen to our product."

00:08:00.565 --> 00:08:02.413
So what did we do?

00:08:02.413 --> 00:08:05.499
Typically, when you have a product
that has a hard drive in it,

00:08:05.499 --> 00:08:08.162
you run it for about 
30 minutes in the factory

00:08:08.162 --> 00:08:11.311
to make sure that hard drive's going 
to be working years later

00:08:11.311 --> 00:08:14.385
for the customer after they 
pull it out of the box.

00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:17.451
What did we do instead?

00:08:17.451 --> 00:08:19.541
We ran that product for over two hours.

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:21.129
Why?

00:08:21.129 --> 00:08:24.254
Well, first off, we could make
a higher quality product,

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.404
be easy to test,

00:08:26.404 --> 00:08:29.346
and make sure it was great
for the customer.

00:08:29.906 --> 00:08:31.159
But most importantly,

00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:34.178
the battery came fully charged
right out of the box,

00:08:34.178 --> 00:08:35.124
ready to use.

00:08:35.124 --> 00:08:38.956
So that customer, 
with all that exhilaration,

00:08:38.956 --> 00:08:40.684
could just start using the product.

00:08:40.684 --> 00:08:43.074
It was great, and it worked.

00:08:43.074 --> 00:08:44.338
People liked it.

00:08:44.338 --> 00:08:47.445
Today, almost every product
that you get that's battery powered

00:08:47.445 --> 00:08:49.508
comes out of the box fully charged,

00:08:49.508 --> 00:08:51.561
even if it doesn't have a hard drive.

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:56.905
But back then, we noticed 
that detail and we fixed it,

00:08:56.905 --> 00:08:59.253
and now everyone else does that as well.

00:08:59.253 --> 00:09:01.894
No more, "Charge before use."

00:09:02.644 --> 00:09:04.701
So why am I telling you this?

00:09:04.701 --> 00:09:06.809
Well, it's seeing the invisible problem,

00:09:06.809 --> 00:09:11.320
not just the obvious problem,
that's important,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.160
not just for product design,
but for everything we do.

00:09:14.682 --> 00:09:18.206
You see, there are invisible problems
all around us,

00:09:18.206 --> 00:09:20.462
ones we can solve.

00:09:20.462 --> 00:09:24.286
But first we need
to see them, to feel them.

00:09:24.996 --> 00:09:26.964
So, I'm hesitant to give you any tips

00:09:26.964 --> 00:09:29.695
about neuroscience or psychology.

00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:32.689
There's far too many experienced people
in the TED community

00:09:32.689 --> 00:09:36.083
who would know much more
about that than I ever will.

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:38.710
But let me leave you with
a few tips that I do,

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.383
that we all can do,
to fight habituation.

00:09:42.383 --> 00:09:45.777
My first tip is to look broader.

00:09:45.777 --> 00:09:47.889
You see, when you're tackling a problem,

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:51.281
sometimes, there are a lot of steps
that lead up to that problem.

00:09:51.281 --> 00:09:54.351
And sometimes, a lot 
of steps after it.

00:09:54.351 --> 00:09:57.700
If you can take a step back
and look broader,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.971
maybe you can change some of those boxes

00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:00.977
before the problem.

00:10:00.977 --> 00:10:02.337
Maybe you can combine them.

00:10:02.337 --> 00:10:05.672
Maybe you can remove them altogether
to make that better.

00:10:06.258 --> 00:10:08.249
Take thermostats, for instance.

00:10:08.249 --> 00:10:11.627
In the 1900s when they first came out,
they were really simple to use.

00:10:11.627 --> 00:10:13.579
You could turn them up or turn them down.

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.279
People understood them.

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:17.772
But in the 1970s,

00:10:17.772 --> 00:10:19.846
the energy crisis struck,

00:10:19.846 --> 00:10:23.416
and customers started thinking about
how to save energy.

00:10:23.416 --> 00:10:24.703
So what happened?

00:10:24.703 --> 00:10:27.731
Thermostat designers decided 
to add a new step.

00:10:27.731 --> 00:10:29.581
Instead of just turning up and down,

00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:31.572
you now had to program it.

00:10:31.572 --> 00:10:34.790
So you could tell it the temperature
you wanted at a certain time.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.586
Now that seemed great.

00:10:36.586 --> 00:10:40.064
Every thermostat had
started adding that feature.

00:10:40.064 --> 00:10:44.340
But it turned out that no one
saved any energy.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.853
Now, why is that?

00:10:45.853 --> 00:10:48.588
Well, people couldn't predict the future.

00:10:48.588 --> 00:10:52.136
They just didn't know how their weeks
would change season to season,

00:10:52.136 --> 00:10:53.634
year to year.

00:10:54.414 --> 00:10:56.745
So no one was saving energy,

00:10:56.745 --> 00:10:57.727
and what happened?

00:10:57.727 --> 00:11:00.350
Thermostat designers went back
to the drawing board

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.392
and they focused on that programming step.

00:11:02.942 --> 00:11:05.409
They made better U.I.s,

00:11:05.409 --> 00:11:07.575
they made better documentation.

00:11:07.575 --> 00:11:12.305
But still, years later,
people were not saving any energy

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:14.901
because they just couldn't
predict the future.

00:11:15.431 --> 00:11:16.909
So what did we do?

00:11:16.909 --> 00:11:20.978
We put a machine-learning algorithm in
instead of the programming

00:11:20.978 --> 00:11:23.676
that would simply watch
when you turned it up and down,

00:11:23.676 --> 00:11:26.270
when you liked a certain temperature
when you got up,

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.977
or when you went away.

00:11:27.977 --> 00:11:29.245
And you know what?

00:11:29.245 --> 00:11:30.172
It worked.

00:11:30.422 --> 00:11:33.639
People are saving energy 
without any programming.

00:11:35.239 --> 00:11:37.246
So, it doesn't matter what you're doing.

00:11:37.246 --> 00:11:40.512
If you take a step back 
and look at all the boxes,

00:11:40.512 --> 00:11:43.533
maybe there's a way
to remove one or combine them

00:11:43.533 --> 00:11:46.047
so that you can make 
that process much simpler.

00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:50.084
So that's my first tip: look broader.

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:54.065
For my second tip, it's to look closer.

00:11:54.065 --> 00:11:57.096
One of my greatest teachers 
was my grandfather.

00:11:59.006 --> 00:12:00.907
He taught me all about the world.

00:12:01.557 --> 00:12:05.049
He taught me how things were built
and how they were repaired,

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:08.771
the tools and techniques necessary
to make a successful project.

00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:14.008
I remember one story 
he told me about screws,

00:12:14.048 --> 00:12:17.678
and about how you need to have
the right screw for the right job.

00:12:17.678 --> 00:12:19.617
There are many different screws:

00:12:19.617 --> 00:12:24.487
wood screws, metal screws,
anchors, concrete screws,

00:12:24.487 --> 00:12:26.232
the list went on and on.

00:12:27.212 --> 00:12:30.485
Our job is to make products
that are easy to install

00:12:30.485 --> 00:12:34.219
for all of our customs themselves
without professionals.

00:12:34.789 --> 00:12:36.210
So what did we do?

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.655
I remembered that story 
that my grandfather told me,

00:12:39.655 --> 00:12:40.928
and so we thought,

00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:43.428
"How many different screws 
can we put in the box?

00:12:43.428 --> 00:12:46.278
Was it going to be two, three,
four, five?

00:12:46.278 --> 00:12:48.574
Because there's so many
different wall types."

00:12:48.574 --> 00:12:51.304
So we thought about it, we optimized it,

00:12:51.304 --> 00:12:55.395
and we came up with three different
screws to put in the box.

00:12:55.845 --> 00:12:58.122
We thought that was going
to solve the problem.

00:12:58.122 --> 00:13:00.817
But it turned out, it didn't.

00:13:01.527 --> 00:13:03.158
So we shipped the product,

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:05.548
and people weren't having
a great experience.

00:13:06.128 --> 00:13:07.336
So what did we do?

00:13:07.336 --> 00:13:09.081
We went back to the drawing board

00:13:09.081 --> 00:13:12.545
just instantly after we figured out
we didn't get it right.

00:13:12.545 --> 00:13:16.269
And we designed a special screw,
a custom screw,

00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:18.440
much to the chagrin of our investors.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.862
They were like, "Why are you spending
so much time on a little screw?

00:13:21.862 --> 00:13:23.861
Get out there and sell more!"

00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:27.184
And we said, "We will sell more
if we get this right."

00:13:27.904 --> 00:13:29.594
And it turned out, we did.

00:13:29.594 --> 00:13:32.888
With that custom little screw,
there was just one screw in the box,

00:13:32.888 --> 00:13:35.995
that was easy to mount
and put on the wall.

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:43.625
So if we focus on those tiny details,
the ones we may not see

00:13:44.404 --> 00:13:46.228
and we look at them as we say,

00:13:46.228 --> 00:13:47.636
"Are those important

00:13:47.636 --> 00:13:50.436
or is that the way we've always done it?

00:13:50.436 --> 00:13:53.320
Maybe there's a way to get rid of those."

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.839
So my last piece of advice
is to think younger.

00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:04.545
Every day, I'm confronted with interesting
questions from my three young kids.

00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:06.316
They come up with questions like,

00:14:06.316 --> 00:14:09.224
"Why can't cars fly around traffic?"

00:14:09.644 --> 00:14:13.420
Or, "Why don't my shoelaces
have Velcro instead?"

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.389
Sometimes, those questions are smart.

00:14:17.409 --> 00:14:19.947
My son came to me the other day
and I asked him,

00:14:19.947 --> 00:14:23.123
"Go run out to the mailbox 
and check it."

00:14:23.123 --> 00:14:26.891
He looked at me, puzzled, and said,

00:14:27.311 --> 00:14:32.225
"Why doesn't the mailbox just check itself
and tell us when it has mail?" (Laughter)

00:14:32.225 --> 00:14:35.878
I was like, "That's a pretty 
good question."

00:14:36.878 --> 00:14:39.492
So, they can ask tons of questions

00:14:39.492 --> 00:14:44.210
and sometimes we find out
we just don't have the right answers.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:50.017
We say, "Son, that's just the way
the world works."

00:14:50.017 --> 00:14:52.567
So the more we're exposed to something,

00:14:52.567 --> 00:14:54.764
the more we get used to it.

00:14:54.764 --> 00:14:56.894
But kids haven't been around 
long enough

00:14:56.894 --> 00:14:58.794
to get used to those things.

00:14:58.794 --> 00:15:00.611
And so when they run into problems,

00:15:00.611 --> 00:15:02.834
they immediately try to solve them,

00:15:02.834 --> 00:15:05.576
and sometimes they find a better way,

00:15:05.576 --> 00:15:08.280
and that way really is better.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:14.119
So my advice that we take to heart
is to have young people on your team,

00:15:14.119 --> 00:15:16.225
or people with young minds.

00:15:16.225 --> 00:15:18.576
Because if you have those young minds,

00:15:18.576 --> 00:15:21.736
they cause everyone in the room
to think younger.

00:15:21.736 --> 00:15:26.100
Picasso once said, 
"Every child is an artist.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:32.406
The problem is when he or she grows up,
is how to remain an artist."

00:15:33.785 --> 00:15:37.734
We all saw the world more clearly
when we saw it for the first time,

00:15:37.734 --> 00:15:40.308
before a lifetime of habits 
got in the way.

00:15:40.998 --> 00:15:43.341
Our challenge is to get back there,

00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:45.586
to feel that frustration,

00:15:45.586 --> 00:15:47.926
to see those little details,

00:15:47.926 --> 00:15:49.666
to look broader,

00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:51.422
look closer,

00:15:51.422 --> 00:15:53.092
and to think younger

00:15:53.792 --> 00:15:55.710
so we can stay beginners.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.373
It's not easy.

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:58.908
It requires us pushing back

00:15:58.908 --> 00:16:02.109
against one of the most basic ways
we make sense of the world.

00:16:03.689 --> 00:16:04.732
But if we do,

00:16:04.732 --> 00:16:07.243
we could do some pretty amazing things.

00:16:07.243 --> 00:16:09.890
For me, hopefully, that's better
product design.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.517
For you, that could mean something else,
something powerful.

00:16:18.105 --> 00:16:21.169
Our challenge is to wake up 
each day and say,

00:16:21.169 --> 00:16:24.344
"How can I experience the world better?"

00:16:24.344 --> 00:16:29.193
And if we do, maybe, just maybe,

00:16:29.193 --> 00:16:33.388
we can get rid of these
dumb little stickers.

00:16:34.248 --> 00:16:35.797
Thank you very much.

00:16:35.797 --> 00:16:38.274
(Applause)
