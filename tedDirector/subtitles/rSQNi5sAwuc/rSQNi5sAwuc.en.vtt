00:00:14.318 --> 00:00:17.270
The brain is an amazing and complex organ.

00:00:17.627 --> 00:00:20.068
And while many people
are fascinated by the brain,

00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:21.835
they can't really tell you that much

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:24.102
about the properties
about how the brain works

00:00:24.142 --> 00:00:26.455
because we don't teach
neuroscience in schools.

00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:28.898
And one of the reasons
why is that the equipment

00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:31.557
is so complex and so expensive

00:00:31.557 --> 00:00:35.703
that it's really only done at major
universities and large institutions.

00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:37.942
And so in order to be able
to access the brain,

00:00:37.942 --> 00:00:39.767
you really need to dedicate your life

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:42.247
and spend six and a half years
as a graduate student

00:00:42.247 --> 00:00:45.202
just to become a neuroscientist
to get access to these tools.

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:47.539
And that's a shame
because one out of five of us,

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.365
that's 20 percent of the entire world,
will have a neurological disorder.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:54.796
And there are zero cures
for these diseases.

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:57.015
And so it seems that
what we should be doing

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.432
is reaching back earlier
in the eduction process

00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:04.009
and teaching students about neuroscience
so that in the future,

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.961
they may be thinking about possibly
becoming a brain scientist.

00:01:08.064 --> 00:01:11.758
When I was a graduate student,
my lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself,

00:01:11.758 --> 00:01:15.639
decided that what if we took
this complex equipment that we have

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:19.038
for studying the brain and made it simple
enough and affordable enough

00:01:19.038 --> 00:01:22.354
that anyone that you know, an amateur
or a high school student,

00:01:22.354 --> 00:01:25.836
could learn and actually participate
in the discovery of neuroscience.

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:27.573
And so we did just that.

00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:30.466
A few years ago, we started
a company called Backyard Brains

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:34.871
and we make DIY neuroscience equipment
and I brought some here tonight,

00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:37.377
and I want to do some demonstrations.

00:01:37.377 --> 00:01:38.811
You guys want to see some?

00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:41.774
So I need a volunteer.

00:01:41.774 --> 00:01:44.027
So right before -- what is your name?
(Applause)

00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:45.070
Sam Kelly: Sam.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.095
Greg Gage: All right, Sam, I'm going
to record from your brain.

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:49.849
Have you had this before?

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:50.950
SK: No.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.264
GG: I need you to stick out
your arm for science,

00:01:53.264 --> 00:01:54.833
roll up your sleeve a bit,

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:57.713
So what I'm going to do,
I'm putting electrodes on your arm,

00:01:57.713 --> 00:01:59.202
and you're probably wondering,

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:02.941
I just said I'm going to record from your
brain, what am I doing with your arm?

00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:06.175
Well, you have about 80 billion neurons
inside your brain right now.

00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:09.663
They're sending electrical messages
back and forth, and chemical messages.

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:12.336
But some of your neurons
right here in your motor cortex

00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:15.431
are going to send messages down
when you move your arm like this.

00:02:15.431 --> 00:02:17.915
They're going to go down
across your corpus callosum,

00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:20.449
down onto your spinal cord
to your lower motor neuron

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:21.718
out to your muscles here,

00:02:21.718 --> 00:02:24.327
and that electrical discharge
is going to be picked up

00:02:24.327 --> 00:02:25.861
by these electrodes right here

00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:27.583
and we're going to be able to listen

00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:29.835
to exactly what your brain
is going to be doing.

00:02:29.835 --> 00:02:31.835
So I'm going to turn this on for a second.

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:34.131
Have you ever heard
what your brain sounds like?

00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:35.131
SK: No.

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:37.900
GG: Let's try it out.
So go ahead and squeeze your hand.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.972
(Rumbling)

00:02:38.972 --> 00:02:40.848
So what you're listening to,

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:44.111
so this is your motor units
happening right here.

00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:46.192
Let's take a look at it as well.

00:02:46.192 --> 00:02:48.961
So I'm going to stand over here,

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.152
and I'm going to open up our app here.

00:02:52.028 --> 00:02:53.727
So now I want you to squeeze.

00:02:53.727 --> 00:02:54.727
(Rumbling)

00:02:54.816 --> 00:02:57.674
So right here, these are the motor units
that are happening

00:02:57.674 --> 00:03:00.133
from her spinal cord
out to her muscle right here,

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:01.355
and as she's doing it,

00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:04.189
you're seeing the electrical activity
that's happening here.

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.630
You can even click here
and try to see one of them.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.101
So keep doing it really hard.

00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:09.171
So now we've paused

00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:13.451
on one motor action potential that's
happening right now inside of your brain.

00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:15.227
Do you guys want to see some more?

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:16.810
(Applause)

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.929
That's interesting,
but let's get it better.

00:03:18.954 --> 00:03:20.278
I need one more volunteer.

00:03:21.857 --> 00:03:23.487
What is your name, sir?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.207
Miguel Goncalves: Miguel.

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.400
GG: Miguel, all right.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.976
You're going to stand right here.

00:03:27.976 --> 00:03:29.968
So when you're moving your arm like this,

00:03:29.968 --> 00:03:33.083
your brain is sending a signal
down to your muscles right here.

00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:34.857
I want you to move your arm as well.

00:03:34.857 --> 00:03:37.731
So your brain is going to send
a signal down to your muscles.

00:03:37.731 --> 00:03:41.580
And so it turns out that there is
a nerve that's right here

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.336
that runs up here that innervates
these three fingers,

00:03:44.336 --> 00:03:47.012
and it's close enough to the skin
that we might be able

00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:49.346
to stimulate that so that what we can do

00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:52.832
is copy your brain signals
going out to your hand

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.353
and inject it into your hand,

00:03:54.353 --> 00:03:57.726
so that your hand will move
when your brain tells your hand to move.

00:03:57.726 --> 00:04:00.933
So in a sense, she will take away
your free will

00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:03.893
and you will no longer have
any control over this hand.

00:04:03.964 --> 00:04:05.567
You with me?

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:07.618
So I just need to hook you up.

00:04:07.618 --> 00:04:09.369
(Laughter)

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.430
So I'm going to find your ulnar nerve,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.392
which is probably right around here.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.631
You don't know what you're signing up for

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:17.726
when you come up.

00:04:17.734 --> 00:04:20.499
So now I'm going to move away
and we're going to plug it in

00:04:20.524 --> 00:04:22.575
to our human-to-human interface over here.

00:04:24.345 --> 00:04:27.392
Okay, so Sam, I want you
to squeeze your hand again.

00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:31.152
Do it again. Perfect.

00:04:31.152 --> 00:04:34.155
So now I'm going to hook you up
over here so that you get the --

00:04:34.155 --> 00:04:36.399
It's going to feel
a little bit weird at first,

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:38.863
this is going to feel like a --
(Laughter)

00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:42.680
You know, when you lose your free will,
and someone else becomes your agent,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.306
it does feel a bit strange.

00:04:44.306 --> 00:04:46.208
Now I want you to relax your hand.

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:47.532
Sam, you're with me?

00:04:47.532 --> 00:04:48.997
So you're going to squeeze.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:52.284
I'm not going to turn it on yet,
so go ahead and give it a squeeze.

00:04:52.284 --> 00:04:54.240
So now, are you ready, Miguel?

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.062
MG: Ready as I'll ever be.

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:59.265
GG: I've turned it on, so go ahead
and turn your hand.

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:01.298
Do you feel that a little bit?
MG: Nope.

00:05:01.298 --> 00:05:03.198
GG: Okay, do it again?
MG: A little bit.

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:04.884
GG: A little bit? (Laughter)

00:05:04.884 --> 00:05:05.909
So relax.

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:07.325
So hit it again.

00:05:07.325 --> 00:05:08.521
(Laughter)

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:10.226
Oh, perfect, perfect.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.110
So relax, do it again.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.878
All right, so right now,

00:05:14.878 --> 00:05:19.279
your brain is controlling your arm
and it's also controlling his arm,

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.471
so go ahead and just do it one more time.

00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:23.504
All right, so it's perfect. (Laughter)

00:05:23.504 --> 00:05:27.265
So now, what would happen
if I took over my control of your hand?

00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:29.508
And so, just relax your hand.

00:05:29.508 --> 00:05:31.726
What happens?

00:05:31.726 --> 00:05:32.760
Ah, nothing.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.298
Why not?

00:05:34.298 --> 00:05:35.993
Because the brain has to do it.

00:05:35.993 --> 00:05:37.307
So you do it again.

00:05:37.346 --> 00:05:39.780
All right, that's perfect.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.319
Thank you guys for being
such a good sport.

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.575
This is what's happening
all across the world --

00:05:44.575 --> 00:05:45.911
electrophysiology!

00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:48.158
We're going to bring on
the neuro-revolution.

00:05:48.158 --> 00:05:49.175
Thank you.

00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:50.928
(Applause)
