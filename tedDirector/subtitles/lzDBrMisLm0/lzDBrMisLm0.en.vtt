00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:13.645
Good morning.

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:14.929
My name is David Rose.

00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:18.509
I am a serial entrepreneur
turned serial investor.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:22.129
And by the use of pitching
PowerPoints to VCs,

00:00:22.153 --> 00:00:24.629
I have personally raised
tens of millions of dollars

00:00:24.653 --> 00:00:27.523
from VCs through PowerPoint pitches.

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:29.725
And turning to the other side
of the equation,

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.165
I've personally supervised the investment
of tens of millions of dollars

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:36.256
into companies who have pitched me
with PowerPoint presentations.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.605
So I think it's safe to say

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.281
I know a little bit
about the process of pitching.

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:42.937
So, the very first question
you've got to figure out is:

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:46.619
What is the single most important
thing that a VC is looking for

00:00:46.643 --> 00:00:49.761
when you come to them
pitching your new business idea?

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:51.790
There are obviously all kinds of things --

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:54.696
business models and financials
and markets and this and that.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.926
Overall, of all the things
that you have to do,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.857
what is the single most important thing

00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:00.857
the VC is going to be investing in?

00:01:01.903 --> 00:01:03.136
Somebody? What?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.314
Audience: People!

00:01:04.662 --> 00:01:08.041
David Rose: People! You!
That's it -- you are the person.

00:01:08.065 --> 00:01:11.941
Therefore, the entire purpose
of a VC pitch is to convince them

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:15.559
that you are the entrepreneur in whom
they are going to invest their money

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:17.473
and make a lot of money in return.

00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:18.664
Now, how do you do this?

00:01:18.688 --> 00:01:20.188
You can't just walk up and say,

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:24.156
"Hi, I'm a really good guy, good girl,
and you should invest in me." Right?

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.754
So in the course of your VC pitch --
you have a very few minutes;

00:01:27.778 --> 00:01:30.891
most VC pitches, angel pitches,
are about 15 minutes,

00:01:30.915 --> 00:01:33.335
most should be less than half an hour --

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.277
people's attention span,
after 18 minutes, begins to drop off.

00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:37.452
Tests have shown.

00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:39.671
So in that 18 or 10 or five minutes,

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:42.631
you have to convey a whole bunch
of different characteristics,

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:44.717
about 10 different characteristics,

00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:46.234
while you're standing up there.

00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:49.872
What's the single most important thing
you've got to convey? What?

00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:51.090
Audience: Integrity.

00:01:51.114 --> 00:01:52.313
DR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy!

00:01:52.337 --> 00:01:54.123
That's a straight line, look at that!

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.544
And I didn't even prompt him.

00:01:55.568 --> 00:01:57.496
Right, integrity. The key thing.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.528
I would much rather invest in,
take a chance on,

00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:04.179
somebody who I know is straight
than where there's any possible question

00:02:04.203 --> 00:02:06.701
of who are they looking out for,
and what's going on.

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:08.709
So the most important thing is integrity.

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:10.827
What's the second most important thing?

00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:12.477
Let's see if you can get this one.

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:13.807
Audience: Self-confidence.

00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:15.136
DR: Close enough. Passion.

00:02:15.878 --> 00:02:19.691
Right? Entrepreneurs, by definition,
are people who are leaving something else,

00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:23.397
starting a new world, creating and putting
their lifeblood into this thing.

00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:24.806
You've got to convey passion.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.133
If you're not passionate,

00:02:26.157 --> 00:02:29.309
why should anyone else be,
or put money into your company

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:31.024
if you're not passionate about it?

00:02:31.048 --> 00:02:33.356
Integrity, passion:
the most important things.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.561
Then there's a whole panoply
of other things you've got to wrap up

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:38.775
in this package you're presenting to a VC.

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.853
Experience: you've got to be able to say,

00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:43.035
"Hey, you know, I've done this before."

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.095
"Done this before" is starting
an enterprise, creating value,

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:48.128
and taking something
from beginning to end.

00:02:48.152 --> 00:02:50.667
That's why VCs love to fund
serial entrepreneurs --

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:52.843
even if you didn't do it right
the first time,

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:56.206
you've learned the lessons, which puts
you in good stead the next time.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.783
Along with the experience of starting
an enterprise or running something --

00:02:59.807 --> 00:03:01.253
doesn't have to be a business,

00:03:01.277 --> 00:03:03.983
it can be an organization
in a school, a not-for-profit.

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:06.061
But experience
in creating an organization.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.236
Next: knowledge.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.411
If you tell me

00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:11.466
you're going to be the developer
of the map of the human genome,

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.880
you better know what a human genome is;
I want you to have expertise.

00:03:14.904 --> 00:03:16.389
I don't want somebody who says,

00:03:16.413 --> 00:03:19.136
"I've got a great idea
in a business I know nothing about.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.939
I don't know who the players are,
what the market is like."

00:03:21.963 --> 00:03:23.979
You've got to know your market, your area.

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.106
And you have to have
the skills that it takes

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.280
to get a company going.

00:03:27.304 --> 00:03:30.377
Those skills include
everything from technical skills

00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:32.123
if it's a technology business,

00:03:32.147 --> 00:03:34.921
to marketing and sales
and management and so on.

00:03:34.945 --> 00:03:37.627
But, you know, not everybody
has all these skills.

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:41.346
Very few people have the full set
of skills it takes to run a company.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.397
What else do you require?
Well, leadership.

00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:46.927
You've got to be able to convince us
that you either have developed a team

00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:49.775
that has all those factors
in it, or else you can.

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.230
And you have the charisma
and the management style

00:03:52.254 --> 00:03:55.033
and the ability to get people
to follow your lead,

00:03:55.057 --> 00:03:58.345
to inspire them, to motivate them
to be part of your team.

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:59.917
Having done all that,

00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:01.662
what else do I want to know as a VC?

00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:03.781
I want to know that you have commitment.

00:04:03.805 --> 00:04:05.766
That you are going to be here to the end.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.412
I want you to say --
or I want you to convey --

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:12.060
that you are going to die if you
have to, with your very last breath,

00:04:12.084 --> 00:04:14.410
your fingernails scratching
as they draw you out.

00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:16.910
You'll keep my money alive
and make more from it.

00:04:16.934 --> 00:04:19.992
I don't want someone who'll
cut and run at the first opportunity.

00:04:20.016 --> 00:04:21.167
Bad things happen.

00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:24.732
There's never been a venture-funded
company where bad things didn't happen.

00:04:24.756 --> 00:04:26.901
So know that you're committed
to the very end.

00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:29.521
You've got to have vision
to see where this is going.

00:04:29.545 --> 00:04:31.358
I don't want another "me too" product.

00:04:31.382 --> 00:04:33.808
I want somebody who can
change the world out there.

00:04:33.832 --> 00:04:35.504
But on top of that, I need realism,

00:04:35.528 --> 00:04:39.685
Because while changing the world
is great, it doesn't always happen.

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:41.638
And before you get to change the world,

00:04:41.662 --> 00:04:43.333
bad things are going to take place;

00:04:43.357 --> 00:04:44.685
you have to deal with that.

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:46.714
And you have to have rational projections.

00:04:46.738 --> 00:04:48.657
Finally, you're asking for my money --

00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:51.115
not just because it's my money,
but because it's me.

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.335
You need to be coachable.

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:54.510
I need to know
you have the ability to listen.

00:04:54.534 --> 00:04:55.974
We've had a lot of experience.

00:04:55.998 --> 00:04:59.277
People who are VCs or angels
investing in you have had experience,

00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:02.301
and they'd like to know that you
want to hear that experience.

00:05:02.325 --> 00:05:05.681
So how do you convey these 10 things
in 10 minutes without saying them?

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:08.080
You can't say, "I've got
integrity, invest in me!"

00:05:08.104 --> 00:05:11.426
You've got to do a whole pitch
that conveys this without conveying it.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.217
Think about your pitch as a timeline.

00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:15.123
It starts off, you walk in the door.

00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:17.026
They know nothing whatsoever about you.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.681
You can take them on an emotional --
all pitches, all sales presentations,

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:22.071
are emotional at some level.

00:05:22.095 --> 00:05:23.991
You can go up, you can go down, right?

00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:25.639
And it goes from beginning to end.

00:05:25.663 --> 00:05:27.813
You walk in, the first thing
you've got to do,

00:05:27.837 --> 00:05:31.207
the overall arc of your presentation,
it's got to start like a rocket.

00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:32.966
You've got maybe 10 seconds --

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.150
between 10 and 30 seconds,
depending on how long the pitch is --

00:05:36.174 --> 00:05:37.698
to get their attention.

00:05:37.722 --> 00:05:39.168
In my case, I've invested.

00:05:39.192 --> 00:05:41.986
I've gotten millions of dollars
from PowerPoint pitches.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.869
"I've invested millions."
That should get you right there.

00:05:44.893 --> 00:05:47.207
This can be a fact
or something counterintuitive.

00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:48.930
It can be a story or an experience.

00:05:48.954 --> 00:05:52.038
But you've got to grab
their emotional attention, focused on you,

00:05:52.062 --> 00:05:53.538
within that first few seconds.

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:55.630
And then from there,
you've got to take them

00:05:55.654 --> 00:05:59.518
on a very solid, steady, upward path,
right from beginning to end.

00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:01.135
Everything has to reinforce this.

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.560
And you've got to get better
and better and better,

00:06:03.584 --> 00:06:04.956
revving up to the very end,

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.487
then you've got to -- boom! --

00:06:06.511 --> 00:06:07.813
knock them out of the park.

00:06:07.837 --> 00:06:09.996
You want to get them
to such an emotional high

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.600
they're ready to write you a check,
throw money at you,

00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:13.775
before you leave.

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:14.950
How do you do that?

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:16.788
First of all, logical progression.

00:06:16.812 --> 00:06:20.171
Any time you go backwards,
any time you skip a step --

00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:23.397
imagine walking up a staircase
where some of the treads are missing,

00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:25.137
or the heights are different.

00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:28.054
You stop, you need to figure out
a nice, logical progression.

00:06:28.078 --> 00:06:31.302
Start with what the market is:
Why are you going to do X, Y or Z?

00:06:31.326 --> 00:06:34.017
And then you've got to tell me
how you're going to do it,

00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:35.566
and what you're going to do.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.755
And it's got to flow
from beginning to end.

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:40.065
You've got to let me know
there are touchstones,

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:42.239
to tie in to the rest
of the world out there.

00:06:42.263 --> 00:06:45.561
For example, reference
companies I've heard of,

00:06:45.585 --> 00:06:48.117
or basic items in your business.

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:50.894
I want to know about things
that I can relate to:

00:06:50.918 --> 00:06:54.615
validators, or anything that tells me
somebody else has approved this,

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.342
or there's outside validation.

00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:59.390
It can be sales; it can be
you got an award for something;

00:06:59.414 --> 00:07:02.112
it can be people have done it before;

00:07:02.136 --> 00:07:05.116
it can be your beta tests
are going great, whatever.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.037
I want to know validation --
not just what you're telling me,

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:10.160
but that somebody
or something else out there

00:07:10.184 --> 00:07:11.418
says this makes sense.

00:07:11.442 --> 00:07:14.509
And then, I'm looking for the upside;
I need a believable upside.

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:17.159
That's two parts; it's got
to be upside and believable.

00:07:17.183 --> 00:07:19.663
The upside means if you tell me
that five years out,

00:07:19.687 --> 00:07:22.746
you're making a million dollars a year,
that's not really upside.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.351
Telling me you'll be making
a billion dollars a year --

00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:26.526
that's not believable.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.701
So it's got to be both.

00:07:27.725 --> 00:07:30.746
On the other hand are things
that take the emotional level down.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.249
You have to recover from those.

00:07:32.273 --> 00:07:34.420
For example, anything
that I know is not true.

00:07:34.444 --> 00:07:37.168
"We have no competition.
Nobody makes a widget like this."

00:07:37.192 --> 00:07:39.296
Odds are I know somebody
who's made a widget,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.928
and the minute you tell me that,

00:07:40.952 --> 00:07:43.580
I discount half of what
you're saying from then on.

00:07:43.604 --> 00:07:46.349
Anything I don't understand,

00:07:46.373 --> 00:07:48.905
where I have to make the leap
myself, in my own head,

00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:50.857
will stop the flow of the presentation.

00:07:50.881 --> 00:07:53.462
So you've got to take me
through like a sixth-grader --

00:07:53.486 --> 00:07:55.549
dub, dub, dub --
but without patronizing me.

00:07:55.573 --> 00:07:57.136
And it's a very tricky path.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.291
But if you can do it,
it works really well.

00:07:59.315 --> 00:08:02.997
Anything that's inconsistent
within your concept --

00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:05.697
if you tell me sales of X, Y or Z
are 10 million dollars,

00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:08.155
five slides later,
they're five million dollars ...

00:08:08.179 --> 00:08:10.963
One may have been gross sales,
one may have been net sales,

00:08:10.987 --> 00:08:13.870
but I want to know that all the numbers
make sense together.

00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:16.433
And then, finally: anything
that's an error or a typo,

00:08:16.457 --> 00:08:19.330
or a stupid mistake or a line
that's in the wrong place --

00:08:19.354 --> 00:08:22.983
that shows me that if you can't do
a presentation, how can you run a company?

00:08:23.007 --> 00:08:24.879
So this all feeds in together.

00:08:24.903 --> 00:08:27.256
The best way to do this
is to look at our betters,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.875
people who have done this before.

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:32.277
Let's look at the most successful
technology executive in the business,

00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:34.113
and see how a presentation goes.

00:08:34.538 --> 00:08:36.771
Bill Gates's PowerPoint
presentation over here.

00:08:36.795 --> 00:08:38.843
Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows.

00:08:38.867 --> 00:08:41.993
Is this how to do a PowerPoint
presentation? What do you think?

00:08:42.017 --> 00:08:44.700
No. Who do you think we should
look at as our role model?

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:47.524
Oh, isn't that funny!
There's another great one over here.

00:08:47.548 --> 00:08:48.729
OK, Steve Jobs.

00:08:48.753 --> 00:08:52.239
You want absolute --
this is the Zen of presentation, right?

00:08:52.263 --> 00:08:55.049
Here he is, one little guy,
black jeans and stuff,

00:08:55.073 --> 00:08:56.265
on a totally empty stage.

00:08:56.289 --> 00:08:57.867
What are you focusing on?

00:08:57.891 --> 00:08:59.940
You're focusing on him!
This is Steve Jobs.

00:08:59.964 --> 00:09:03.924
So are these wonderful long bullet points,
whole list of things good?

00:09:03.948 --> 00:09:06.479
No, they're not. The long
bullet points are bad.

00:09:06.503 --> 00:09:09.088
What's good? Short. Short bullet points.

00:09:09.112 --> 00:09:12.768
But you know what? Even better than short
bullet points are no bullet points.

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:14.037
Just give me the headline.

00:09:14.061 --> 00:09:15.212
And you know what?

00:09:15.236 --> 00:09:17.260
How many bullet points
does Steve Jobs use?

00:09:17.284 --> 00:09:18.655
Basically, none.

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:19.831
What do you do?

00:09:19.855 --> 00:09:22.691
Best of all, images. Just a simple image.

00:09:22.715 --> 00:09:25.346
I look at the image;
a picture's worth a thousand words.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.854
You look at the image
and you've got the whole thing.

00:09:27.878 --> 00:09:31.312
Then you come back to me; you're focused
on me, why I'm such a great guy,

00:09:31.336 --> 00:09:33.646
why you want to invest,
why this all makes sense.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.761
That said, we only have a very short time,

00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:38.823
so let's run through the things
to include in your presentation.

00:09:38.847 --> 00:09:41.328
First of all, none of these big,
long-titled slides

00:09:41.352 --> 00:09:43.931
with blah, blah, I'm presenting
to so-and-so on X date.

00:09:43.955 --> 00:09:46.677
I know the day, I know who I am --
I don't need all that.

00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:48.201
Just give me your company logo.

00:09:48.225 --> 00:09:50.432
I look at the logo,
and it ties it to my brain.

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:53.852
Then I come back to you.
I'm focused on you, OK?

00:09:53.876 --> 00:09:57.801
You give me your quick, 15-second
or 30-second intro, grab my attention.

00:09:57.825 --> 00:09:59.830
Then you give me
a quick business overview.

00:09:59.854 --> 00:10:02.981
This is not a five-minute pitch.
This is, you know, two sentences.

00:10:03.005 --> 00:10:05.034
"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market."

00:10:05.058 --> 00:10:07.720
Or, "We sell services to help do X."
You know, whatever.

00:10:07.744 --> 00:10:10.908
And that is like the picture
on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box.

00:10:10.932 --> 00:10:12.389
That lets me know the context.

00:10:12.413 --> 00:10:15.665
It gives me the armature for the whole
thing you'll be going through;

00:10:15.689 --> 00:10:18.551
it lets me put everything
in relation to what you've told me.

00:10:18.575 --> 00:10:22.857
Then you've got to walk me through,
show me who your management team is.

00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:26.430
I want to know the size of the market.
Why is this market worth getting at?

00:10:26.454 --> 00:10:28.864
I want to know your product,
that's very important.

00:10:28.888 --> 00:10:31.139
Now, this is not
a product pitch or sales pitch.

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:34.356
I don't want to know all the ins and outs,
just what the heck is it?

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.442
If it's a website, show me
a screenshot of your website.

00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:39.478
Don't do a live demo.
Never do a live demo.

00:10:39.502 --> 00:10:41.752
Do a canned demo,
or something that lets me know

00:10:41.776 --> 00:10:43.934
why people are going
to buy whatever it is.

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.198
Now that I know what you're selling,

00:10:46.222 --> 00:10:47.797
tell me how you make money on it.

00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:52.303
For every X you sell, you get Y,
or services of Z.

00:10:52.327 --> 00:10:55.273
I want to know what the business model
is on a per-unit basis,

00:10:55.297 --> 00:10:57.257
or for the actual product you're selling.

00:10:57.281 --> 00:11:00.001
I want to know who you're selling to
in terms of customers

00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:02.911
and if you have any special
relationships that will help you,

00:11:02.935 --> 00:11:05.945
whether it's a distribution relationship
or a producing partner.

00:11:05.969 --> 00:11:07.120
Again, validation.

00:11:07.144 --> 00:11:10.395
This helps to say you're bigger
than just one little thing over here.

00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:11.855
But everybody has competition.

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.189
There's never been a company
with no competition,

00:11:14.213 --> 00:11:16.942
even if the competition
is the old way of doing something.

00:11:16.966 --> 00:11:19.246
I want to know exactly
what your competition is,

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.337
and that will help me judge
how you fit into the whole operation.

00:11:22.361 --> 00:11:24.024
I want to know how you're special.

00:11:24.048 --> 00:11:25.770
I know what your competition does --

00:11:25.794 --> 00:11:28.469
how are you going to prevent
them from eating your lunch?

00:11:28.493 --> 00:11:30.501
All this ties into the financial overview.

00:11:30.525 --> 00:11:33.453
And you can't do a VC pitch
without giving me your financials.

00:11:33.477 --> 00:11:36.983
I want to know a year or two back,
or as long as you've been in existence.

00:11:37.007 --> 00:11:39.252
And I want to know
four or five years forward.

00:11:39.276 --> 00:11:40.905
Five is a bit much. Probably four.

00:11:40.929 --> 00:11:43.895
And I want to know how that business
model, on a product basis,

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:47.123
will translate into a company model:
How many widgets will you sell?

00:11:47.147 --> 00:11:50.150
You make X amount per widget.
I want to know what the driver is.

00:11:50.174 --> 00:11:52.845
We'll have 1,000 customers
this year and 10,000 the next,

00:11:52.869 --> 00:11:54.540
our revenues will do this and that.

00:11:54.564 --> 00:11:57.285
That gives me the whole picture
for the next several years

00:11:57.309 --> 00:11:58.503
into which I'm investing.

00:11:58.527 --> 00:12:01.588
And I want to know how the money
from me will help you get there.

00:12:01.612 --> 00:12:03.853
You're going to open
an offshore plant in China,

00:12:03.877 --> 00:12:06.316
you're going to spend it all
on sales and marketing,

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.203
you're going to go to Tahiti, whatever.

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:11.043
But then comes the ask,
where you tell me how much you want.

00:12:11.067 --> 00:12:13.538
You're looking for 5 million --
at what valuation?

00:12:13.562 --> 00:12:15.772
Two million? 100,000?

00:12:15.796 --> 00:12:17.771
What's the money in so far? Who invested?

00:12:17.795 --> 00:12:21.782
I hope you invested -- if you can't invest
in your own thing, why should I?

00:12:21.806 --> 00:12:24.096
So I like to know if you have
friends and family,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.985
or angel investors, or more VCs before.

00:12:26.009 --> 00:12:28.355
What's the capital structure
up until this point?

00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:31.483
Finally, having done all that,
you've now told me the whole thing,

00:12:31.507 --> 00:12:33.998
so now you bring it back
to that conclusion.

00:12:34.022 --> 00:12:35.418
This is that rocket going up.

00:12:35.442 --> 00:12:37.312
Hopefully everything has been positive.

00:12:37.336 --> 00:12:39.783
And everything you say clicks,
it all makes sense.

00:12:39.807 --> 00:12:41.784
And I'm thinking, "This is really great!"

00:12:41.808 --> 00:12:44.355
Then you take me back
to just your logo on the screen.

00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:46.136
And I look at the logo -- OK, good.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.740
Now I come back to you.
Nothing else to look at, right?

00:12:48.764 --> 00:12:52.287
Now you've got to wrap it up
to give me the final -- boom! --

00:12:52.311 --> 00:12:54.700
the final pitch that's going
to send me into space.

00:12:54.724 --> 00:12:56.776
Now, in the process of doing this,

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.255
how do you remember
the sequences and do it?

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.716
You've noticed I'm not looking
at the screen, right?

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.302
The screen is in front of me,

00:13:03.326 --> 00:13:05.137
so I couldn't even see if I wanted to.

00:13:05.161 --> 00:13:06.736
So how do I know what's going on?

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.554
Well, I have a laptop in front of me.

00:13:08.578 --> 00:13:10.153
You're looking at me and at this.

00:13:10.177 --> 00:13:11.328
What am I looking at?

00:13:11.352 --> 00:13:13.024
You think that I'm looking at that?

00:13:13.048 --> 00:13:14.334
No, I'm looking, actually,

00:13:14.358 --> 00:13:16.698
at a special version
of PowerPoint over here,

00:13:16.722 --> 00:13:19.428
which shows me the slides
ahead and behind, my notes,

00:13:19.452 --> 00:13:20.849
so I can see what's going on.

00:13:20.873 --> 00:13:23.847
PowerPoint has this built into
every copy of it that's shipped.

00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:26.690
If you use Apple's Keynote,
it's got an even better version.

00:13:26.714 --> 00:13:29.747
There's another program called
Ovation you can get from Adobe

00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:31.156
that they bought last summer,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.867
which helps you run the timers
and lets you figure out what's going on.

00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:37.449
So, here's my wrap-up
to take you to the moon, right?

00:13:37.473 --> 00:13:39.627
I usually do a Top 10,
but we don't have time,

00:13:39.651 --> 00:13:41.540
so: David's Top Five Presentation Tips.

00:13:41.564 --> 00:13:43.903
Number five: always use presenter mode,

00:13:43.927 --> 00:13:46.300
or Ovation, or presenter tools.

00:13:46.324 --> 00:13:48.404
It lets you know
exactly where you're going,

00:13:48.428 --> 00:13:51.304
helps you pace yourself,
gives you a timer, the whole bit.

00:13:51.328 --> 00:13:53.194
Number four: always use remote control.

00:13:53.218 --> 00:13:55.517
Have you seen me touch
the computer? No. Why not?

00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:58.358
Because I'm using remote control.
Always use remote control.

00:13:58.382 --> 00:14:01.312
Number three: the handouts you give
are not your presentation.

00:14:01.336 --> 00:14:02.724
If you follow my suggestions,

00:14:02.748 --> 00:14:04.999
you'll have a very spare,
Zen-like presentation,

00:14:05.023 --> 00:14:08.455
which is great to convey who you are
and get people emotionally involved,

00:14:08.479 --> 00:14:09.725
but not good as a handout.

00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:13.326
You want a handout that gives more
information; it has to stand without you.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.879
Number two: don't read your speech.
Can you imagine?

00:14:15.903 --> 00:14:18.148
(Reading) "You should invest
in my company ... "

00:14:18.172 --> 00:14:19.324
It doesn't work.

00:14:19.348 --> 00:14:22.949
And the number one presentation tip:
never, ever look at the screen.

00:14:22.973 --> 00:14:25.157
You're making a connection
with your audience,

00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:27.659
and you always want
a one-on-one connection.

00:14:27.683 --> 00:14:29.718
The screen should come up behind you

00:14:29.742 --> 00:14:32.413
and supplement what you're doing,
instead of replace you.

00:14:32.437 --> 00:14:34.010
And that is how to pitch to a VC.
