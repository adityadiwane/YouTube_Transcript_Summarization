00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I still remember the day in school

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
when our teacher told us

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
that the world population had become

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
three billion people,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and that was in 1960.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I'm going to talk now about

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
how world population has changed from that year

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and into the future,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
but I will not use digital technology,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
as I've done during my first five TEDTalks.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Instead, I have progressed,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
and I am, today, launching

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
a brand new analog teaching technology

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
that I picked up from IKEA:

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
this box.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
This box contains one billion people.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
And our teacher told us

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
that the industrialized world, 1960,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
had one billion people.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
In the developing world, she said,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
they had two billion people.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And they lived away then.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
There was a big gap between

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
the one billion in the industrialized world

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and the two billion in the developing world.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
In the industrialized world,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
people were healthy,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
educated, rich,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and they had small families.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
And their aspiration

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
was to buy a car.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
And in 1960, all Swedes were saving

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
to try to buy a Volvo like this.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
This was the economic level at which Sweden was.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
But in contrast to this,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
in the developing world, far away,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
the aspiration of the average family there

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
was to have food for the day.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
They were saving

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
to be able to buy a pair of shoes.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
There was an enormous gap in the world

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
when I grew up.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And this gap between the West and the rest

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
has created a mindset of the world,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
which we still use linguistically

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
when we talk about "the West"

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and "the Developing World."

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
But the world has changed,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And that's what I'm going to show you,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
because since 1960

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
what has happened in the world up to 2010

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
is that a staggering

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
four billion people

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
have been added to the world population.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
Just look how many.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
The world population has doubled

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
since I went to school.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And of course, there's been economic growth in the West.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
so the Western population moved over to here.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and they want to fly.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
So this is where they are today.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And the most successful of the developing countries,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
they have moved on, you know,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and they have become emerging economies, we call them.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
They are now buying cars.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And what happened a month ago

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
was that the Chinese company, Geely,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
they acquired the Volvo company,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and then finally the Swedes understood that

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
something big had happened in the world.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
(Laughter)

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
So there they are.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
that is struggling for food and shoes,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
they are still almost as poor

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
as they were 50 years ago.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
The new thing is that

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
which are also becoming emerging economies,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
and they already also have two to three children

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
per woman, as those [richer also] have.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And their aspiration now

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
is, of course, to buy a bicycle,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
But this is the world

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
we have today,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
no longer any gap.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
to the very richest over here is wider than ever.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
But there is a continuous world

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
from walking, biking,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
driving, flying --

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
there are people on all levels,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
This is the new world we have today

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
in 2010.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And what will happen in the future?

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
Well, I'm going to project

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
into 2050.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
I was in Shanghai recently,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
and I listened to what's happening in China,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
and it's pretty sure that they will catch up,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
just as Japan did.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
one to two or three percent.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
[But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
They will start flying.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And these

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
they will also forge forwards economically.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
And if,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
but only if,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
we invest in the right green technology --

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
so that we can avoid severe climate change,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
and energy can still be relatively cheap --

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
then they will move all the way up here.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And they will start to buy

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
electric cars.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
This is what we will find there.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
So what about the poorest two billion?

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
What about the poorest two billion here?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Will they move on?

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Well, here population [growth] comes in

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
family planning is widely used,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
and population growth is coming to an end.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Here [among the poorest], population is growing.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
increase to three billion,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and they will thereafter

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
increase to four billion.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
There is nothing --

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen --

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
that can stop this [growth] from happening.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Because we already have this [growth] in process.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
But if, and only if,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
[the poorest] get out of poverty,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
they get education, they get improved child survival,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
then population growth

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
will stop in 2050.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
We cannot have people on this level

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
looking for food and shoes

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
because then we get continued population growth.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
And let me show you why

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
by converting back to the old-time

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
digital technology.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Here I have on the screen

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
my country bubbles.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Every bubble is a country. The size is population.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
The colors show the continent.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
The yellow on there is the Americas;

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe;

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
green is the Middle East

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and this light blue is South Asia.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
That's India and this is China. Size is population.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Here I have children per woman:

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
two children, four children, six children, eight children --

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
big families, small families.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
The year is 1960.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
And down here, child survival,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
the percentage of children surviving childhood

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
up to starting school:

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and almost 100 percent, as we have today

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
in the wealthiest and healthiest countries.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960:

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
one billion Western world here --

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
high child-survival, small families --

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
and all the rest,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
the rainbow of developing countries,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
with very large families

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and poor child survival.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
What has happened? I start the world. Here we go.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing?

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
They get soap, hygiene, education,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
vaccination, penicillin

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
and then family planning. Family size is decreasing.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
[When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
is falling down there [to small families].

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Look, Bangladesh catching up with India.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
The whole emerging world

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
joins the Western world

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
with good child survival

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
and small family size,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
but we still have the poorest billion.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
Can you see the poorest billion,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
those [two] boxes I had over here?

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
They are still up here.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
And they still have a child survival

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
of only 70 to 80 percent,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
meaning that if you have six children born,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
there will be at least four who survive

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
to the next generation.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
And the population will double in one generation.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
So the only way

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
of really getting world population [growth] to stop

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
is to continue to improve child survival

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
to 90 percent.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
That's why investments by Gates Foundation,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
UNICEF and aid organizations,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
together with national government in the poorest countries,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
are so good;

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
because they are actually

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
helping us to reach

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
a sustainable population size of the world.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
Child survival is the new green.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
It's only by child survival

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
that we will stop population growth.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
And will it happen?

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Well, I'm not an optimist,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
neither am I a pessimist.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
I'm a very serious "possibilist."

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
It's a new category where we take emotion apart,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
and we just work analytically with the world.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
It can be done.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
We can have a much more just world.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
With green technology

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
and with investments to alleviate poverty,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
and global governance,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
the world can become like this.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
And look at the position of the old West.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
Remember when this blue box was all alone,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
leading the world, living its own life.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
This will not happen [again].

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
The role of the old West in the new world

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
is to become the foundation

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
of the modern world --

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
nothing more, nothing less.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
But it's a very important role.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
Do it well and get used to it.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
Thank you very much.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.260
(Applause)
