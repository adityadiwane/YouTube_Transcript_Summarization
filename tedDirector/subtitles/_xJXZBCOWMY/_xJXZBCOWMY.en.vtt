00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
What's happening in genomics,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.160
and how this revolution is about to change everything we know

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.160
about the world, life, ourselves, and how we think about them.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
If you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.160
and you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.160
you know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.160
that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.160
In this case, it was picking up bones and creating a tool,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.160
using it as a tool, which meant that apes just, sort of,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
running around and eating and doing each other

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.160
figured out they can make things if they used a tool.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
And that moved us to the next level.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.160
And, you know, we in the last 30 years in particular

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.160
have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
And we've seen many seminal moments.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.160
We've seen the creation of small computers in the '70s and early '80s,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
and who would have thought back then that every single person

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
would not have just one computer but probably 20,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160
in your home, and in not just your P.C. but in every device --

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
in your washing machine, your cell phone.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.160
You're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
Then we go along and create the Internet

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
and connect the world together; we flatten the world.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.160
We've seen so much change, and we've given ourselves these tools now --

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
these high-powered tools --

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.160
that are allowing us to turn the lens inward

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.160
into something that is common to all of us, and that is a genome.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.160
How's your genome today? Have you thought about it lately?

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.160
Heard about it, at least? You probably hear about genomes these days.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
I thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
It's, sort of, like if you ask people,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
Well, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband?

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
People never want to say, I really don't understand.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160
So, I will tell you right off of the bat.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.160
You've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.160
A genome is really a description for 
all of the DNA that is in a living organism.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.160
And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
It doesn't matter whether you're a yeast;

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
it doesn't matter whether you're a mouse;

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.160
doesn't matter whether you're a fly; we all have DNA.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.160
The DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
And when Watson and Crick in the '50s

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.160
first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule --

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
very long, complicated molecule --

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
we then started on this journey to understand that

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.160
inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
what we inherit, what diseases we may get.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.160
We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.160
that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.160
since the beginning of us, of us as creatures.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
There is a historical archive.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.160
Living in your genome is the history of our species,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.160
and you as an individual human being, where you're from,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
and that's now starting to be understood.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
But also, the genome is really the instruction manual.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
It is the program. It is the code of life.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
It is what makes you function;

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160
it is what makes every organism function.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
DNA is a very elegant molecule.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
It's long and it's complicated.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.160
Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters:

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.160
A, T, C, G; they represent the name of a chemical.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.160
And with these four letters, you can create a language:

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.160
a language that can describe anything, and very complicated things.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
You know, they are generally put together in pairs,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
creating a word or what we call base pairs.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
And you would, you know, when you think about it,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.160
four letters, or the representation of four things, makes us work.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
And that may not sound very intuitive,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.160
but let me flip over to something else you know about, and that's computers.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.160
Look at this screen here and, you know, you see pictures

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.160
and you see words, but really all there are are ones and zeros.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.160
The language of technology is binary;

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
you've probably heard that at some point in time.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.160
Everything that happens in digital is converted,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
or a representation, of a one and a zero.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.160
So, when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.160
that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160
When you're seeing these pictures, it's all ones and zeros,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
and when you're talking on your telephone, your cell phone,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
and it's going over the network,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.160
your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
And look at all the complex things and wonderful things

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
we've been able to create with just a one and a zero.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.160
Well, now you ramp that up to four, and you have a lot of complexity,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.160
a lot of ways to describe mechanisms.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
So, let's talk about what that means.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
So, if you look at a human genome,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:01.160
they consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs. That's a lot.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
And they mix up in all different fashions,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
and that makes you a human being.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.160
If you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.160
we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.160
It's not really all that much data.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
I will also tell you we're at least as buggy.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
(Laughter)

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.160
This here is a bug in my genome

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.160
that I have struggled with for a long, long time.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.160
When you get sick, it is a bug in your genome.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.160
In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
like cancer, we haven't been able to cure

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.160
because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160
We are starting to understand that.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
So, up to this point we tried to fix it

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.160
by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
and maybe it's going to make it work.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:11.160
But if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer?

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
What is the code?

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.160
What are the exact instructions that are making it do that?

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.160
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.160
So, for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine, here's a few factoids for you.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
We actually have about 24,000 genes that do things.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.160
We have about a hundred, 120,000 others

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
that don't appear to function every day,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.160
but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
going back tens of thousands of years.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
You might also be interested in knowing

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
that a mouse has about the same amount of genes.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:56.160
They recently sequenced Pinot Noir, and it also has about 30,000 genes,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.160
so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.160
or the evolutionary order of any particular species.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
Now, look around: just look next to your neighbor,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
look forward, look backward. We all look pretty different.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.160
A lot of very handsome and pretty people here, skinny, chubby,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:22.160
different races, cultures. We are all 99.9% genetically equal.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.160
It is one one-hundredth of one percent of genetic material

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
that makes the difference between any one of us.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
That's a tiny amount of material,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.160
but the way that ultimately expresses itself

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.160
is what makes changes in humans and in all species.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
So, we are now able to read genomes.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.160
The first human genome took 10 years, three billion dollars.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160
It was done by Dr. Craig Venter.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.160
And then James Watson's -- one of the co-founders of DNA --

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.160
genome was done for two million dollars, and in just two months.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
And if you think about the computer industry

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.160
and how we've gone from big computers to little ones

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.160
and how they get more powerful and faster all the time,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now:

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.160
we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.160
for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour;

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
you will see that happen in the next five years.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.160
And what that means is, you are going to walk around

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:29.160
with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
And when you buy medicine,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
You will give your genome to the pharmacist,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
and your drug will be made for you

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
and it will work much better than the ones that were --

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
you won't have side effects.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
All those side effects, you know, oily residue and, you know,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.160
whatever they say in those commercials: forget about that.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
They're going to make all that stuff go away.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
What does a genome look like?

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.160
Well, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.160
If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
but what scientists are doing now is

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.160
they're understanding what these do and what they mean.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.160
Because what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.160
In other words, the first couple of sentences here,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
assuming this is a grape plant:

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.160
make a root, make a branch, create a blossom.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.160
In a human being, down in here it could be:

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.160
make blood cells, start cancer.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:40.160
For me it may be: every calorie you consume, you conserve,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
because I come from a very cold climate.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.160
For my wife: eat three times as much and you never put on any weight.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
It's all hidden in this code,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.160
and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160
So, what can we do with genomes now that we can read them,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.160
now that we're starting to have the book of life?

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.160
Well, there's many things. Some are exciting. 

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.160
Some people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.160
that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me, but that's okay.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.160
So, you know, we now can learn the history of organisms.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
You can do a very simple test: scrape your cheek; send it off.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
You can find out where your relatives come from;

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
We can understand functionality. This is really important.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.160
We can understand, for example, why we create plaque in our arteries,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.160
what creates the starchiness inside of a grain,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:42.160
why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
We can also look at, at a grander scale, what creates problems,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.160
what creates disease, and how we may be able to fix them.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
Because we can understand this,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
we can fix them, make better organisms.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
Most importantly, what we're learning

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.160
is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160
The toolbox exists.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:09.160
An architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
and we now have the ability to use it.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.160
We are now not just reading genomes; we are writing them.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160
This company, Synthetic Genomics, I'm involved with,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.160
created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug,

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
a very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.160
If you have a UTI, you've probably -- or ever had a UTI --

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
you've come in contact with this little bug.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.160
Very simple -- only has about 246 genes --

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:41.160
but we were able to completely synthesize that genome.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.160
Now, you have the genome and you say to yourself,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.160
So, if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in --

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
does it just boot up and live?

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
Well, guess what. It does.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.160
Not only does it do that; if you took the genome -- that synthetic genome --

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
and you plugged it into a different critter, like yeast,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.160
you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.160
It's, sort of, like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.160
Well, actually, you could do it the other way.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.160
So, you know, by being able to write a genome

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.160
and plug it into an organism,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.160
the software, if you will, changes the hardware.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
And this is extremely profound.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
So, last year the French and Italians announced

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.160
they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:43.160
The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.160
and they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
They have discovered pathways that create flavors,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
although it's very important to understand

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
that those compounds that it's cranking out

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160
have to match a receptor in our genome, in our tongue,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.160
for us to understand and interpret those flavors.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
They've also discovered that

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.160
there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.160
They now are understanding, and the work is going on,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.160
exactly how this plant works, and we have the capability to know,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.160
to read that entire code and understand how it ticks.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160
So, then what do you do?

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.160
Knowing that we can read it, knowing that we can write it, change it,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.160
maybe write its genome from scratch. So, what do you do?

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.160
Well, one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken-Noir.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.160
(Laughter)

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
We can build a better vine.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160
By the way, just so you know:

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.160
you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms;

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
that is not genetically modified.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
They're not grown from seeds; they're grafted into root stock;

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
they would not exist in nature on their own.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.160
So, don't worry about, don't stress about that stuff. We've been doing this forever.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
So, we could, you know, focus on disease resistance;

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.160
we can go for higher yields without necessarily having

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.160
dramatic farming techniques to do it, or costs.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.160
We could conceivably expand the climate window:

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.160
we could make Pinot Noir grow maybe in Long Island, God forbid.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
(Laughter)

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.160
We could produce better flavors and aromas. 

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.160
You want a little more raspberry, a little more chocolate here or there?

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
All of these things could conceivably be done,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
But there's an ecosystem here.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.160
In other words, we're not, sort of, unique little organisms running around;

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160
we are part of a big ecosystem.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.160
In fact -- I'm sorry to inform you --

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.160
that inside of your digestive tract is about 10 pounds of microbes

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
which you're circulating through your body quite a bit.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
Our ocean's teaming with microbes;

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.160
in fact, when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.160
in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.160
by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.160
We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.160
and regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.160
We find microbial life in every part of the planet:

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:31.160
in ice, in coal, in rocks, in volcanic vents; it's an amazing thing.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.160
But we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.160
as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.160
it is the ecosystem around them,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.160
it is the microbes that live in their root systems,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.160
that have just as much impact on the character of those plants

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.160
as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.160
If you take a closer look at a root system,

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.160
you will find there are many, many, many diverse microbial colonies.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.160
This is not big news to viticulturists;

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.160
they have been, you know, concerned with water and fertilization.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:13.160
And, again, this is, sort of, my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology:

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.160
you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.160
You don't necessarily know with granularity

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:27.160
exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.160
We can start to figure that out.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.160
We all talk about terroir; we worship terroir; 

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.160
we say, Wow, is my terroir great! It's so special.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.160
I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.160
Well, you know, we really, we argue and debate about it --

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.160
we say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. Well, guess what?

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.160
We can figure out what the heck terroir is.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.160
It's in there, waiting to be sequenced.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.160
There are thousands of microbes there.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.160
They're easy to sequence: unlike a human,

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.160
they, you know, have a thousand, two thousand genes;

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.160
we can figure out what they are.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:08.160
All we have to do is go around and sample, dig into the ground, find those bugs,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:13.160
sequence them, correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like --

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.160
that's just a big database -- and then fertilize.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.160
And then we understand what is terroir.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.160
So, some people will say, Oh, my God, are we playing God?

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.160
Are we now, if we engineer organisms, are we playing God?

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.160
And, you know, people would always ask James Watson --

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.160
he's not always the most politically correct guy ...

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.160
(Laughter)

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.160
... and they would say, "Are, you know, are you playing God?"

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.160
And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question:

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.160
"Well, somebody has to."

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.160
(Laughter)

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.160
I consider myself a very spiritual person,

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.160
and without, you know, the organized religion part,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.160
and I will tell you: I don't believe there's anything unnatural.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.160
I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.160
I told you I'm going to make some of you puke.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.160
It's very simple: we don't invent molecules, compounds.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.160
They're here. They're in the universe.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.160
We reorganize things, we change them around,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.160
but we don't make anything unnatural.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.160
Now, we can create bad impacts --

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.160
we can poison ourselves; we can poison the Earth --

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.160
but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.160
So, what's happening today is, Nature is presenting us with a toolbox,

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.160
and we find that this toolbox is very extensive.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.160
There are microbes out there that actually make gasoline, believe it or not.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.160
There are microbes, you know -- go back to yeast.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.160
These are chemical factories;

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.160
the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature,

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.160
and we now can use those.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.160
There also is a set of rules.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.160
Nature will not allow you to --

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.160
we could engineer a grape plant, but guess what.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.160
We can't make the grape plant produce babies.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.160
Nature has put a set of rules out there.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.160
We can work within the rules; we can't break the rules;

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.160
we're just learning what the rules are.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.160
I just ask the question, if you could cure all disease --

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.160
if you could make disease go away,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.160
because we understand how it actually works,

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.160
if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.160
that grow in very hard-to-grow environments,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.160
if we could create clean and plentiful energy --

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.160
we, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics,

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.160
have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.160
and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:38.160
So, carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar, not anything.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.160
Carbon dioxide, a little bit of sunlight,

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.160
you end up with a lipid that is highly refined.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.160
We could solve our energy problems; we can reduce CO2,;

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.160
we could clean up our oceans; we could make better wine.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.160
If we could, would we?

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.160
Well, you know, I think the answer is very simple:

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.160
working with Nature, working with this tool set that we now understand,

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.160
is the next step in humankind's evolution.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.160
And all I can tell you is, stay healthy for 20 years.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.160
If you can stay healthy for 20 years, you'll see 150, maybe 300.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.160
Thank you.
