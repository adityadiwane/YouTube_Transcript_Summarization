00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:20.773
To understand the world that live in, we tell stories.

00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:24.243
And while remixing and sharing have come to define

00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:25.824
the web as we know it,

00:00:25.824 --> 00:00:29.659
all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.124
that allow us to make things online.

00:00:32.124 --> 00:00:36.206
But video has been left out. It arrived on the web

00:00:36.206 --> 00:00:38.952
in a small box, and there it has remained,

00:00:38.952 --> 00:00:42.041
completely disconnected from the data and the content

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.913
all around it.

00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:45.825
In fact, in over a decade on the web, the only thing

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:49.421
that has changed about video is the size of the box

00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:52.298
and the quality of the picture.

00:00:52.298 --> 00:00:55.466
Popcorn changes all of that.

00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:58.579
It's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.964
with content pulled live directly from the web.

00:01:01.964 --> 00:01:05.499
Videos created with Popcorn behave like the web itself:

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:09.546
dynamic, full of links, and completely remixable,

00:01:09.546 --> 00:01:13.845
and finally allowed to break free from the frame.

00:01:13.845 --> 00:01:16.249
I want to give you a demo of a prototype

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:18.289
that we're working on that we'll launch later this fall.

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.235
It will be completely free, and it will work in any browser.

00:01:23.235 --> 00:01:26.301
So, every Popcorn production begins with the video,

00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:28.687
and so I've made a short, 20-second clip

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:32.438
using a newscaster template that we use in workshops.

00:01:32.438 --> 00:01:36.122
So let's watch it. We'll go back, and I'll show you how we made it.

00:01:36.122 --> 00:01:38.874
Hi, and welcome to my newscast.

00:01:38.874 --> 00:01:41.315
I've added my location with a Google Map,

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.683
and it's live, so try moving it around.

00:01:44.683 --> 00:01:48.075
You can add pop-ups with live links and custom icons,

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:51.539
or pull in content from any web service, like Flickr,

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.369
or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.008
So let's go back, and I'll show you what you saw. There was a lot there.

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:03.434
So this is the timeline, and if you've ever edited video,

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:06.353
you're familiar with this, but instead of clips in the timeline,

00:02:06.353 --> 00:02:09.939
what you're looking at is web events pulled into the video.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.330
Now in this Popcorn production we've got

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.083
the title card, we've got a Google Map that shows up

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:18.570
picture-in-picture, then Popcorn lets it push

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.930
outside the frame and take over the whole screen.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.599
There are two pop-ups bringing you some other information,

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.977
and a final article with a link out to the original article.

00:02:28.977 --> 00:02:32.511
Let's go to this Google Map, and I'll show you how you can edit it.

00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:35.760
All you do, go into the timeline, double-click the item,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.019
and I've set it to Toronto, because that's where I'm from.

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.541
Let's set it to something else.

00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:44.672
Popcorn immediately goes out onto the web,

00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:47.729
talks to Google, grabs the map, and puts it in the display.

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:49.335
And it's exactly the same

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.071
for the people who watch your production.

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:53.582
And it's live. It's not an image. So you click on it,

00:02:53.582 --> 00:02:57.812
you zoom in, right down to street view if you want to.

00:02:57.812 --> 00:03:00.819
Now in the video, I mentioned adding a live feed,

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.000
which we can do right now, so let's add a live feed

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.884
from Flickr. Go over to the right-hand side,

00:03:06.884 --> 00:03:09.273
grab Flickr from the list of options,

00:03:09.273 --> 00:03:11.520
drag it into the timeline,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.994
and put it where you'd like it to go,

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:16.457
and it immediately goes out to Flickr and starts pulling in

00:03:16.457 --> 00:03:19.469
images based on the tags. Now, my developers

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.329
really like ponies, and so they've set that as the default tag.

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.445
Let's try something else,

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:30.013
maybe something a bit more relevant to today.

00:03:30.013 --> 00:03:32.743
Now here are live images being pulled straight from the feed.

00:03:32.743 --> 00:03:34.331
If you come and watch this a week from now,

00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:35.875
this will be completely different,

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:38.384
dynamic, just like the web, and just like the web,

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.436
everything is sourced, so click your link,

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:44.229
and you go straight to Flickr and see the source image.

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.475
Everything you've seen today is built with the basic

00:03:46.475 --> 00:03:50.035
building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

00:03:50.035 --> 00:03:51.954
That means it's completely remixable. It also means

00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:54.518
there's no proprietary software. All you need

00:03:54.518 --> 00:03:57.477
is a web browser.

00:03:57.477 --> 00:04:00.847
So imagine if every video that we watched on the web

00:04:00.847 --> 00:04:03.893
worked like the web, completely remixable,

00:04:03.893 --> 00:04:06.640
linked to its source content, and interactive

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.021
for everyone who views it.

00:04:09.021 --> 00:04:12.017
I think Popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on

00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:14.395
the web, and the way we understand the world we live in.

00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:20.081
Thank you. (Applause)
