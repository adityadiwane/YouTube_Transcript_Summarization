00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
We see with the eyes,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
but we see with the brain as well.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.160
And seeing with the brain
is often called imagination.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.160
And we are familiar with
the landscapes of our own imagination,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.160
our inscapes. 
We've lived with them all our lives.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.160
But there are also hallucinations as well,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
and hallucinations 
are completely different.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
They don't seem to be of our creation.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
They don't seem to be under our control.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
They seem to come from the outside,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
and to mimic perception.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
So I am going to be talking
about hallucinations,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.160
and a particular sort
of visual hallucination

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.160
which I see among my patients.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
A few months ago, I got a phone call

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
from a nursing home where I work.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.160
They told me that one of their residents,
an old lady in her 90s,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
was seeing things,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
and they wondered if she'd gone bonkers

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
or, because she was an old lady,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
whether she'd had a stroke,
or whether she had Alzheimer's.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.160
And so they asked me if
I would come and see Rosalie,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
the old lady.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
I went in to see her.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
It was evident straight away

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
that she was perfectly sane

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
and lucid and 
of good intelligence,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.160
but she'd been very startled
and very bewildered,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
because she'd been seeing things.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
And she told me --

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
the nurses hadn't mentioned this --

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
that she was blind,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.160
that she had been completely blind
from macular degeneration for five years.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
But now, for the last few days,
she'd been seeing things.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
So I said, "What sort of things?"

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
And she said, "People in Eastern dress,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.160
in drapes, walking up and down stairs.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
A man who turns towards me and smiles.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160
But he has huge teeth
on one side of his mouth.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
Animals too.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
I see a white building.
It's snowing, a soft snow.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.160
I see this horse with a harness,
dragging the snow away.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.160
Then, one night, the scene changes.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
I see cats and dogs walking towards me.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
They come to a certain point
and then stop.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
Then it changes again.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
I see a lot of children.
They are walking up and down stairs.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
They wear bright colors, rose and blue,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
like Eastern dress."

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
Sometimes, she said,
before the people come on,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.160
she may hallucinate
pink and blue squares on the floor,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
which seem to go up to the ceiling.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.160
I said, "Is this like a dream?"

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
And she said, "No, it's not
like a dream. It's like a movie."

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
She said, "It's got color.
It's got motion.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.160
But it's completely silent,
like a silent movie."

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
And she said that
it's a rather boring movie.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
She said, "All these people
with Eastern dress,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.160
walking up and down,
very repetitive, very limited."

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
(Laughter)

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
And she has a sense of humor.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
She knew it was a hallucination.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
But she was frightened.
She'd lived 95 years

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
and she'd never had
a hallucination before.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
She said that the hallucinations
were unrelated

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.160
to anything she was thinking
or feeling or doing,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.160
that they seemed to come on
by themselves, or disappear.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
She had no control over them.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
She said she didn't recognize

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
any of the people or places

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
in the hallucinations.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
And none of the people
or the animals,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.160
well, they all seemed oblivious of her.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
And she didn't know what was going on.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
She wondered if she was going mad

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
or losing her mind.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Well, I examined her carefully.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
She was a bright old lady,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.160
perfectly sane. She had
no medical problems.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160
She wasn't on any medications
which could produce hallucinations.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
But she was blind.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
And I then said to her,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
"I think I know what you have."

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.160
I said, "There is a special form
of visual hallucination

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.160
which may go with deteriorating
vision or blindness.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
This was originally described," I said,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
"right back in the 18th century,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
by a man called Charles Bonnet.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
There is nothing wrong with your brain.
There is nothing wrong with your mind.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome."

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
And she was very relieved at this,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.160
that there was nothing
seriously the matter,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
and also rather curious.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
She said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?"

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
She said, "Did he have them himself?"

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
And she said, "Tell all the nurses

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
(Laughter)

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.160
"I'm not crazy. I'm not demented.
I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
Well, so I did tell the nurses.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
Now this, for me, is a common situation.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
I work in old-age homes, largely.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
I see a lot of elderly people

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.160
who are hearing impaired
or visually impaired.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
About 10 percent
of the hearing impaired people

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
get musical hallucinations.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
And about 10 percent
of the visually impaired people

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
get visual hallucinations.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
You don't have to be completely blind,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
only sufficiently impaired.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
Now with the original description
in the 18th century,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
Charles Bonnet did not have them.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
His grandfather had these hallucinations.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
His grandfather was a magistrate,
an elderly man.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.160
He'd had cataract surgery.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
His vision was pretty poor.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.160
And in 1759, he described to his grandson

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
various things he was seeing.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
The first thing he said was he saw

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
a handkerchief in midair.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
It was a large blue handkerchief

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
with four orange circles.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
And he knew it was a hallucination.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
You don't have handkerchiefs in midair.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.160
And then he saw a big wheel in midair.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.160
But sometimes he wasn't sure
whether he was hallucinating or not,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
because the hallucinations would fit

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
in the context of the visions.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
So on one occasion,
when his granddaughters were visiting them,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.160
he said, "And who are these
handsome young men with you?"

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
And they said, "Alas, Grandpapa,
there are no handsome young men."

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.160
And then the handsome
young men disappeared.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
It's typical of these hallucinations

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
that they may come in a flash
and disappear in a flash.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160
They don't usually fade in and out.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
They are rather sudden,
and they change suddenly.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
Charles Lullin, the grandfather,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
saw hundreds of different figures,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
different landscapes of all sorts.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.160
On one occasion, he saw a man
in a bathrobe smoking a pipe,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
and realized it was himself.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
That was the only figure he recognized.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
On one occasion when he was walking
in the streets of Paris,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
But when he got back home,
he saw a miniature of the scaffolding

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.160
six inches high, on his study table.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
This repetition of perception

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
is sometimes called palinopsia.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.160
With him and with Rosalie,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
what seems to be going on --

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
and Rosalie said, "What's going on?" --

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
and I said that as you lose vision,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
as the visual parts of the brain
are no longer getting any input,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.160
they become hyperactive and excitable,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
and they start to fire spontaneously.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
And you start to see things.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
The things you see
can be very complicated indeed.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.160
With another patient of mine,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
who, also had some vision,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.160
the vision she had could be disturbing.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
On one occasion, she said she saw

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
And he turned around. And then

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160
he divided into six figures
in striped shirts,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
who started walking towards her.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
And then the six figures came together again,
like a concertina.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
Once, when she was driving,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
or rather, her husband was driving,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
the road divided into four

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.160
and she felt herself going
simultaneously up four roads.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.160
She had very mobile
hallucinations as well.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
A lot of them had to do with a car.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
Sometimes she would see a teenage boy

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.160
sitting on the hood of the car.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
He was very tenacious
and he moved rather gracefully

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
when the car turned.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
And then when they came to a stop,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff,
100 foot in the air,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
and then disappear.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.160
Another patient of mine
had a different sort of hallucination.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
This was a woman who
didn't have trouble with her eyes,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
but the visual parts of her brain,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
a little tumor in the occipital cortex.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.160
And, above all, she would see cartoons.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.160
These cartoons would be transparent

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
and would cover
half the visual field, like a screen.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:34.160
And especially she saw
cartoons of Kermit the Frog.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.160
(Laughter)

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
Now, I don't watch Sesame Street,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160
but she made a point of saying,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.160
"Why Kermit?" she said,
"Kermit the Frog means nothing to me.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
You know, I was wondering
about Freudian determinants.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
Why Kermit?

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.160
She didn't mind the cartoons too much.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.160
But what did disturb her
was she got very persistent

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
images or hallucinations of faces

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.160
and as with Rosalie,
the faces were often deformed,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.160
with very large teeth or very large eyes.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
And these frightened her.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.160
Well, what is going on with these people?

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.160
As a physician, I have to try
and define what's going on,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160
and to reassure people,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.160
especially to reassure them
that they're not going insane.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
Something like 10 percent, as I said,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
of visually impaired people get these.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.160
But no more than one percent
of the people acknowledge them,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160
because they are afraid
they will be seen as insane or something.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
And if they do mention them
to their own doctors

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
they may be misdiagnosed.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
In particular,
the notion is that if you see

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
things or hear things, you're going mad,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
but the psychotic hallucinations 
are quite different.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
Psychotic hallucinations,
whether they are visual or vocal,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
they address you. They accuse you.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
They seduce you. They humiliate you.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
They jeer at you.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
You interact with them.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.160
There is none of this quality
of being addressed

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.160
There is a film. You're seeing a film
which has nothing to do with you,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
or that's how people think about it.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.160
There is also a rare thing
called temporal lobe epilepsy,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
and sometimes, if one has this,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
one may feel oneself transported back

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
to a time and place in the past.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.160
You're at a particular road junction.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
You smell chestnuts roasting.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160
You hear the traffic.
All the senses are involved.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
And you're waiting for your girl.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.160
And it's that Tuesday
evening back in 1982.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
And the temporal lobe hallucinations

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
are all-sense hallucinations,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
full of feeling, full of familiarity,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
located in space and time,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
coherent, dramatic.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
The Charles Bonnet
ones are quite different.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.160
So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
you have all sorts of levels,

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
from the geometrical hallucinations --

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.160
the pink and blue squares the woman had --

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.160
up to quite elaborate hallucinations

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
with figures and especially faces.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
Faces, and sometimes deformed faces,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160
are the single commonest thing

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
in these hallucinations.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
And one of the second
commonest is cartoons.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.160
So, what is going on?

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
Fascinatingly, in the last few years,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.160
it's been possible to do
functional brain imagery,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.160
to do fMRI on people
as they are hallucinating.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.160
And in fact, to find that different parts

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
of the visual brain are activated

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
as they are hallucinating.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
When people have these
simple geometrical hallucinations,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.160
the primary visual cortex is activated.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
This is the part of the brain
which perceives edges and patterns.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.160
You don't form images
with your primary visual cortex.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.160
When images are formed,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.160
a higher part of the visual cortex

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160
is involved in the temporal lobe.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.160
And in particular,
one area of the temporal lobe

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
is called the fusiform gyrus.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.160
And it's known that if people
have damage in the fusiform gyrus,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.160
they maybe lose
the ability to recognize faces.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.160
But if there is an abnormal activity
in the fusiform gyrus,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
they may hallucinate faces,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
and this is exactly what you find
in some of these people.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.160
There is an area
in the anterior part of this gyrus

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.160
where teeth and eyes are represented,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.160
and that part of the gyrus is activated

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.160
when people get
the deformed hallucinations.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
There is another part of the brain

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
which is especially activated

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
when one sees cartoons.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
It's activated when
one recognizes cartoons,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.160
when one draws cartoons,
and when one hallucinates them.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
It's very interesting
that that should be specific.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
There are other parts of the brain
which are specifically involved

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
with the recognition and hallucination

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
of buildings and landscapes.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.160
Around 1970, it was found
that there were not only parts of the brain,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160
but particular cells.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.160
"Face cells" were discovered around 1970.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.160
And now we know
that there are hundreds of other

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160
sorts of cells,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
which can be very, very specific.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
So you may not only have

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
"car" cells,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.160
you may have "Aston Martin" cells.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.160
(Laughter)

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
I saw an Aston Martin this morning.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
I had to bring it in.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.160
And now it's in there somewhere.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.160
(Laughter)

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.160
Now, at this level, in what's called
the inferotemporal cortex,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
there are only visual images,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
or figments or fragments.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
It's only at higher levels

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
that the other senses join in

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
and there are connections
with memory and emotion.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.160
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome,

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.160
you don't go to those higher levels.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
You're in these levels
of inferior visual cortex

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
where you have thousands
and tens of thousands

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.160
and millions of images,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
or figments,
or fragmentary figments,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
all neurally encoded

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.160
in particular cells
or small clusters of cells.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.160
Normally these are all part of

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.160
the integrated stream
of perception, or imagination,

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.160
and one is not conscious of them.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.160
It is only if one
is visually impaired or blind

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
that the process is interrupted.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
And instead of getting normal perception,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160
you're getting an anarchic,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.160
convulsive stimulation, or release,

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.160
of all of these visual cells

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.160
in the inferotemporal cortex.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
So, suddenly you see a face.
Suddenly you see a car.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
Suddenly this, and suddenly that.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.160
The mind does its best to organize

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
and to give some sort
of coherence to this,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
but not terribly successfully.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.160
When these were first described,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.160
it was thought that
they could be interpreted like dreams.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
But in fact people say,

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160
"I don't recognize the people.
I can't form any associations."

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.160
"Kermit means nothing to me."

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.160
You don't get anywhere
thinking of them as dreams.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.160
Well, I've more
or less said what I wanted.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
I think I just want to recapitulate

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
and say this is common.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160
Think of the number of blind people.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
There must be hundreds
of thousands of blind people

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.160
who have these hallucinations,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.160
but are too scared to mention them.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.160
So this sort of thing
needs to be brought into

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:50.160
notice, for patients,
for doctors, for the public.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.160
Finally, I think they are

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160
infinitely interesting and valuable,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.160
for giving one some insight
as to how the brain works.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.160
Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago --

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.160
he wondered how,
thinking these hallucinations,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.160
how, as he put it,
the theater of the mind

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.160
could be generated
by the machinery of the brain.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.160
Now, 250 years later,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.160
I think we're beginning
to glimpse how this is done.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.160
Thanks very much.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.160
(Applause)

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.160
Chris Anderson: That was superb.
Thank you so much.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160
You speak about these things
with so much insight

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.160
and empathy for your patients.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:36.160
Have you yourself experienced
any of the syndromes you write about?

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.160
Oliver Sacks: I was afraid you'd ask that.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.160
(Laughter)

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.160
Well, yeah, a lot of them.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.160
And actually I'm a little
visually impaired myself.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.160
I'm blind in one eye,
and not terribly good in the other.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.160
And I see the geometrical hallucinations.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
But they stop there.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.160
CA: And they don't disturb you?

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.160
Because you understand what's doing it,
it doesn't make you worried?

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.160
OS: Well they don't disturb me
any more than my tinnitus,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.160
which I ignore.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.160
They occasionally interest me,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160
and I have many pictures
of them in my notebooks.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.160
I've gone and had an fMRI myself,

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.160
to see how my visual cortex
is taking over.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.160
And when I see all these hexagons

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.160
and complex things,
which I also have,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
in visual migraine,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.160
I wonder whether everyone
sees things like this,

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.160
and whether things
like cave art or ornamental art

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.160
may have been derived from them a bit.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.160
CA: That was an utterly,
utterly fascinating talk.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.160
Thank you so much for sharing.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
OS: Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.160
(Applause)
