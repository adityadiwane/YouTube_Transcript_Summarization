00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
You know, culture was born of the imagination,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it --

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
came into being when our species descended

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
from our progenitor, Homo erectus,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
and, infused with consciousness, began a journey that would carry it

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
to every corner of the habitable world.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
For a time, we shared the stage with our distant cousins, Neanderthal,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
who clearly had some spark of awareness,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
but -- whether it was the increase in the size of the brain,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
or the development of language,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
or some other evolutionary catalyst --

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.160
we quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
By the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
27,000 years ago,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
our direct ancestors had already,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
and for 5,000 years,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
been crawling into the belly of the earth,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
they had brought into being

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
the great art of the Upper Paleolithic.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
And I spent two months in the caves of southwest France

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
with the poet Clayton Eshleman, who wrote a beautiful book called "Juniper Fuse."

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
And you could look at this art and you could, of course,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
see the complex social organization

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
of the people who brought it into being.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
But more importantly, it spoke of a deeper yearning,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
something far more sophisticated than hunting magic.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
And the way Clayton put it was this way.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.160
He said, "You know, clearly at some point,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
we were all of an animal nature, and at some point, we weren't."

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
And he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
through ritual, to rekindle a connection

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
that had been irrevocably lost.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
So, he saw this art not as

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.160
hunting magic, but as postcards of nostalgia.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
And viewed in that light,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
it takes on a whole other resonance.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
And the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
is that as an aesthetic expression,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
it lasted for almost 20,000 years.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
If these were postcards of nostalgia,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
ours was a very long farewell indeed.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
And it was also the beginning of our discontent,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
because if you wanted to distill all of our experience

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
since the Paleolithic, it would come down to two words:

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
how and why.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
And these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
Now, all people share the same

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
raw, adaptive imperatives.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
We all have children.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
We all have to deal with the mystery of death,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
the world that waits beyond death,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
the elders who fall away into their elderly years.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
All of this is part of our common experience,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
and this shouldn't surprise us, because, after all,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
biologists have finally proven it to be true,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
something that philosophers have always dreamt to be true.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
And that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
We are all cut from the same genetic cloth.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
All of humanity, probably, is descended from a thousand people

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
who left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
But the corollary of that is that,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
if we all are brothers and sisters

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
and share the same genetic material,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
all human populations share the same raw human genius,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
the same intellectual acuity.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
And so whether that genius is placed

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
into -- technological wizardry

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
has been the great achievement of the West --

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
or by contrast, into unraveling the complex threads

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
of memory inherent in a myth,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
There is no progression of affairs

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
in human experience.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
There is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
that conveniently places Victorian England at the apex

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
and descends down the flanks

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
to the so-called primitives of the world.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
All peoples are simply cultural options,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
different visions of life itself.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
But what do I mean by different visions of life

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
making for completely different

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
possibilities for existence?

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
Well, let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
ever brought into being by the imagination,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
that of Polynesia.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
10,000 square kilometers,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
tens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
I recently sailed on the Hokulea,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
named after the sacred star of Hawaii,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
throughout the South Pacific to make a film

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
about the navigators.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
These are men and women who, even today, can name

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
250 stars in the night sky.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
These are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
of islands beyond the visible horizon,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
simply by watching the reverberation of waves

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
across the hull of their vessel, knowing full well

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
that every island group in the Pacific

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
has its unique refractive pattern

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
that can be read with the same perspicacity

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
These are sailors who in the darkness, in the hull of the vessel,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
can distinguish as many as 32 different sea swells

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
moving through the canoe at any one point in time,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
distinguishing local wave disturbances

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
that can be followed with the same ease

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
Indeed, if you took all of the genius

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
that allowed us to put a man on the moon

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
and applied it to an understanding of the ocean,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
what you would get is Polynesia.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
And if we slip from the realm of the sea

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
into the realm of the spirit of the imagination,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
And I recently made a film called "The Buddhist Science of the Mind."

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
Why did we use that word, science?

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
What is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
What is Buddhism but 2,500 years

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
of empirical observation

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
as to the nature of mind?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
I travelled for a month in Nepal with our good friend, Matthieu Ricard,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
and you'll remember Matthieu famously said to all of us

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
here once at TED,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
"Western science is a major response to minor needs."

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
We spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be 100

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
without losing our teeth.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
The Buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160
Their billboards are manuals,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.160
prayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
And with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche, we began a pilgrimage

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
to a curious destination,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
accompanied by a great doctor.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
And the destination was a single room in a nunnery,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
where a woman had gone into lifelong retreat

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
55 years before.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
And en route, we took darshan from Rinpoche,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
and he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
the essence of the Buddhist path.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
All life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
It means things happen.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
The cause of suffering is ignorance.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
By that, the Buddha did not mean stupidity;

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
he meant clinging to the illusion

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
that life is static and predictable.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
The third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
And the fourth and most important, of course,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
was the delineation of a contemplative practice

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160
that not only had the possibility

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
of a transformation of the human heart,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
but had 2,500 years of empirical evidence

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
that such a transformation was a certainty.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
And so, when this door opened onto the face of a woman

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
who had not been out of that room in 55 years,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160
you did not see a mad woman.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
You saw a woman who was more clear

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
than a pool of water in a mountain stream.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
And of course, this is what the Tibetan monks told us.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
They said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
you went to the moon, but you did.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
You may not believe that we achieve enlightenment

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
in one lifetime, but we do.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
And if we move from the realm of the spirit

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160
to the realm of the physical,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
to the sacred geography of Peru --

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160
I've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160
that literally believe that the Earth is alive,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
responsive to all of their aspirations,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
all of their needs.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
And, of course, the human population

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
has its own reciprocal obligations.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
I spent 30 years living amongst

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
the people of Chinchero

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
and I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
Once each year, the fastest young boy

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
in each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
And for one day, he wears the clothing of his sister

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
and he becomes a transvestite,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
a waylaka. And for that day,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
he leads all able-bodied men on a run,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
but it's not your ordinary run.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
You start off at 11,500 feet.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
You run down to the base of the sacred mountain, Antakillqa.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.160
You run up to 15,000 feet,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
descend 3,000 feet.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
Climb again over the course of 24 hours.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160
And of course, the waylakama spin,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
the trajectory of the route,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
is marked by holy mounds of Earth,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160
where coke is given to the Earth, libations of alcohol to the wind,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
the vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
And the metaphor is clear: you go into the mountain as an individual,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
but through exhaustion, through sacrifice,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
you emerge as a community that has once again

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
reaffirmed its sense of place in the planet.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
And at 48, I was the only outsider ever to go through this,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
only one to finish it.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
I only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
than anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160
But these localized rituals become pan-Andean,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
and these fantastic festivals,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
like that of the Qoyllur Rit'i, which occurs

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
when the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
It's kind of like an Andean Woodstock:

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
60,000 Indians on pilgrimage

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
to the end of a dirt road

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
that leads to the sacred valley, called the Sinakara,

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
which is dominated by three tongues

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160
of the great glacier.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
The metaphor is so clear. You bring the crosses from your community,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
in this wonderful fusion of Christian

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
and pre-Columbian ideas.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
You place the cross into the ice,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.160
in the shadow of Ausangate, the most sacred of all Apus,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
or sacred mountains of the Inca.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
Now, these ideas and these events

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
allow us even to deconstruct iconic places

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
that many of you have been to, like Machu Picchu.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
Machu Picchu was never a lost city.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
On the contrary, it was completely linked in

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.160
to the 14,000 kilometers of royal roads

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.160
the Inca made in less than a century.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
But more importantly, it was linked in

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
to the Andean notions of sacred geography.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
The intiwatana, the hitching post to the sun,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
that falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
which is Sugarloaf Mountain, called Huayna Picchu.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
If you come to the south of the intiwatana, you find an altar.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
Climb Huayna Picchu, find another altar.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
Take a direct north-south bearing,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
you find to your astonishment

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
that it bisects the intiwatana stone,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
goes to the skyline,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
hits the heart of Salcantay, the second of the most important mountains

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
of the Incan empire.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
And then beyond Salcantay, of course,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
directly in that same alignment, the Milky Way overhead.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160
But what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below?

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
The sacred river, the Urubamba, or the Vilcanota,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
which is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
but it's also the trajectory that Viracocha walked

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
And where does the river rise?

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.160
Right on the slopes of the Koariti.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
So, 500 years after Columbus,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
these ancient rhythms of landscape

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
are played out in ritual.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160
Now, when I was here at the first TED,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
I showed this photograph: two men of the Elder Brothers,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.160
the descendants, survivors of El Dorado.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.160
These, of course, are the descendants

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.160
of the ancient Tairona civilization.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
If those of you who are here remember that I mentioned

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.160
but the training for the priesthood is extraordinary.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.160
Taken from their families, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
for 18 years -- two nine-year periods deliberately chosen

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.160
to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.160
All that time, the world only exists as an abstraction,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
as they are taught the values of their society.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
and their prayers alone, maintain the cosmic balance.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.160
Now, the measure of a society is not only what it does,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
but the quality of its aspirations.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160
And I always wanted to go back into these mountains,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.160
to see if this could possibly be true,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.160
as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160
Reichel-Dolmatoff.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
So, literally two weeks ago,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
I returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
on what was clearly the most

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
extraordinary trip of my life.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
These really are a people who live and breathe

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
the realm of the sacred,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
a baroque religiosity that is simply awesome.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
They consume more coca leaves than any human population,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
half a pound per man, per day.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
The gourd you see here is --

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
everything in their lives is symbolic.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160
Their central metaphor is a loom.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
They say, "Upon this loom, I weave my life."

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
They refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
as "threads."

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.160
When they pray for the dead, they make these gestures with their hands,

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
spinning their thoughts into the heavens.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
You can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
The gourd is a feminine aspect; the stick is a male.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
You put the stick in the powder

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.160
to take the sacred ashes -- well, they're not ashes,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.160
they're burnt limestone --

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
to empower the coca leaf, to change

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.160
the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
of cocaine hydrochloride.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
But if you break a gourd, you cannot simply throw it away,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
because every stroke of that stick

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
that has built up that calcium,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
the measure of a man's life,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
has a thought behind it.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
Fields are planted in such an extraordinary way,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160
that the one side of the field

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.160
is planted like that by the women.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
The other side is planted like that by the men. Metaphorically,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.160
you turn it on the side, and you have a piece of cloth.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
And they are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.160
the greatest goldsmiths of South America,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
who in the wake of the conquest,

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.160
retreated into this isolated volcanic massif

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
that soars to 20,000 feet

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
above the Caribbean coastal plain.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
There are four societies:

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
the Kogi, the Wiwa, the Kankwano and the Arhuacos.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
I traveled with the Arhuacos,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
and the wonderful thing about this story

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.160
was that this man, Danilo Villafane --

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.160
if we just jump back here for a second.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160
When I first met Danilo, in the Colombian embassy in Washington,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
I couldn't help but say, "You know,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
you look a lot like an old friend of mine."

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.160
Well, it turns out he was the son of my friend, Adalberto,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.160
from 1974, who had been killed by the FARC.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
And I said, "Danilo, you won't remember this,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
but when you were an infant, I carried you on my back,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
up and down the mountains."

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.160
And because of that, Danilo invited us

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.160
to go to the very heart of the world,

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
a place where no journalist had ever been permitted.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
Not simply to the flanks of the mountains,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.160
And this man sitting cross-legged

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
is now a grown-up Eugenio,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
a man who I've known since 1974.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.160
And this is one of those initiates.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
No, it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for 18 years,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160
but they are kept within the confines

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
of the ceremonial men's circle

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
for 18 years.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
This little boy will never step outside

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160
of the sacred fields

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.160
that surround the men's hut for all that time,

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.160
until he begins his journey of initiation.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.160
For that entire time, the world only exists as an abstraction,

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
as he is taught the values of society,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160
including this notion that their prayers alone

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
maintain the cosmic balance.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160
Before we could begin our journey,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
we had to be cleansed at the portal of the Earth.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.160
And you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet --

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.160
there must be nothing between the feet

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
and the Earth for a mamo.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
And this is actually the place where the Great Mother

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.160
sent the spindle into the world

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160
that elevated the mountains and created the homeland

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
that they call the heart of the world.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
We traveled high into the paramo,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.160
and as we crested the hills,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.160
we realized that the men were interpreting

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
every single bump on the landscape

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
in terms of their own intense religiosity.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
And then of course, as we reached our final destination,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
a place called Mamancana,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
we were in for a surprise,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
because the FARC were waiting to kidnap us.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.160
And so we ended up being taken aside into these huts,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.160
hidden away until the darkness.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
And then, abandoning all our gear,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.160
we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
in a quite dramatic scene.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
It's going to look like a John Ford Western.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160
And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn, so it was quite harrowing.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
It will be a very interesting film. But what was fascinating

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
is that the minute there was a sense of dangers,

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.160
the mamos went into a circle of divination.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
And of course, this is a photograph

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160
literally taken the night we were in hiding,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.160
as they divine their route

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
to take us out of the mountains.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
We were able to, because we had trained

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
people in filmmaking,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
continue with our work,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
and send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
to the final sacred lakes

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
to get the last shots for the film,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
and we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160
taking the elements from the highlands to the sea.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
And here you see how their sacred landscape

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160
has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
and yet, still they pray.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
And it's an amazing thing to think

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
that this close to Miami,

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.160
two hours from Miami, there is an entire civilization of people

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.160
praying every day for your well-being.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160
They call themselves the Elder Brothers.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160
They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160
as the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.160
why it is that we do what we do to the Earth.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.160
Now, if we slip to another end of the world,

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.160
I was up in the high Arctic

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.160
to tell a story about global warming,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160
inspired in part by

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160
the former Vice President's wonderful book.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.160
And what struck me so extraordinary

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.160
was to be again with the Inuit --

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.160
a people who don't fear the cold, but take advantage of it.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.160
A people who

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160
find a way, with their imagination,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.160
to carve life out of that very frozen.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160
A people for whom blood on ice

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
is not a sign of death, but an affirmation of life.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.160
And yet tragically, when you now go to those northern communities,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.160
you find to your astonishment

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.160
that whereas the sea ice used to come in in September

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.160
and stay till July,

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.160
in a place like Kanak in northern Greenland,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.160
it literally comes in now in November

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160
and stays until March.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.160
So, their entire year has been cut in half.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.160
Now, I want to stress that none of these peoples

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.160
that I've been quickly talking about here

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
are disappearing worlds.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160
These are not dying peoples.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.160
On the contrary, you know,

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.160
you discover that the world is not flat.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.160
The world remains a rich tapestry.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.160
It remains a rich topography of the spirit.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.160
These myriad voices of humanity

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.160
are not failed attempts at being new,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.160
failed attempts at being modern.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.160
They're unique facets of the human imagination.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.160
They're unique answers to a fundamental question:

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.160
what does it mean to be human and alive?

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.160
And when asked that question, they respond

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.160
with 6,000 different voices.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.160
And collectively, those voices become our human repertoire

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.160
for dealing with the challenges that will confront us

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.160
in the ensuing millennia.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.160
Our industrial society is scarcely

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.160
300 years old.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.160
That shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.160
that we have all of the answers

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.160
for all of the questions that will confront us

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.160
in the ensuing millennia.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160
The myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.160
They are unique answers to that fundamental question:

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.160
what does it mean to be human and alive?

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160
And there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth,

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.160
taking with it not only plants and animals,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.160
but the legacy of humanity's brilliance.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.160
Right now, as we sit here in this room,

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.160
of those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.160
fully half aren't being taught to children.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.160
So, you're living through a time

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.160
when virtually half of humanity's intellectual,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.160
social and spiritual legacy

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.160
is being allowed to slip away.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.160
This does not have to happen.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.160
These peoples are not failed attempts at being modern --

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.160
quaint and colorful and destined to fade away

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.160
as if by natural law.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.160
In every case, these are dynamic, living peoples

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.160
being driven out of existence by identifiable forces.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.160
That's actually an optimistic observation,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.160
because it suggests that if human beings

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.160
are the agents of cultural destruction,

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.160
we can also be, and must be,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
the facilitators of cultural survival.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.160
Thank you very much.
