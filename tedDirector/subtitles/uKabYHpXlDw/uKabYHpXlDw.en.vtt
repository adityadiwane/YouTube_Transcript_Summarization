00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.330
When I knew I was going to come to speak to you, I thought,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
"I gotta call my mother."

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
I have a little Cuban mother -- she's about that big.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
You still with me? (Laughter)

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.330
I called her up.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
"Hello, how're you doing, baby?"

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you."

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?"

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
I said, "I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people."

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.330
to the White House."

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
"Ma, don't start!"

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
And I told her I was coming to TED, and she said,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.330
"What's the problem?"

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
And I said, "Well, I'm not sure."

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.330
I said, "I have to talk to them about stories.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
It's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'"

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.330
And she said, "Well, you design a story when you make it up,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
it's entertainment when you tell it,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
and you're going to use a microphone."

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
(Laughter)

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
I said, "You're a peach, ma. Pop there?"

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?"

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
(Laughter)

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.330
Then my pop got on there.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
My pop, he's one of the old souls, you know --

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
old Cuban man from Camaguey.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
Camaguey is a province in Cuba.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
He's from Florida.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
He was born there in 1924.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.330
He grew up in a bohio of dirt floors,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
and the structure was the kind used by the Tainos,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
our old Arawak ancestors.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.330
My father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.330
and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
"Papi, help."

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
"I already heard your mother. I think she's right."

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
(Laughter)

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
"After what I just told you?"

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
My whole life, my father's been there.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
So we talked for a few minutes, and he said,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
"Why don't you tell them what you believe?"

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
I love that, but we don't have the time.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.330
Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.330
Great story is the art of letting go.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
So I'm going to tell you a little story.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
Remember, this tradition comes to us

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.330
not from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.330
or we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
Back then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.330
When Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
Have you been watching the commercials?

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.330
Because every one of us has this desire, for once -- just once --

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
to tell our story and have it heard.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.330
There are stories you tell from stages.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.330
There's stories that you may tell

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
in a small group of people with some good wine.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.330
And there's stories you tell late at night to a friend,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
maybe once in your life.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:39.330
And then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
I'm not telling you that story.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
I'm telling you this one.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
It's called, "You're Going to Miss Me."

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
It's about human connection.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
My Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
in that short character sketch,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.330
came to the United States one thousand years ago.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.330
I was born in 19 -- I forget, and I came to this country

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
We went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
And Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
And in that little Southern town, I grew up,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
and grew up hearing these stories.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
But this story only happened a few years ago.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
I called my mom.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
It was a Saturday morning.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
It's delicious. It's savory.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth --

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.330
is that enough? It makes your armpits juicy, you know?

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.330
That kind of food, yeah.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
This is the sensory part of the program, people.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
I called my mother, and she said, "Carmen, I need you to come, please.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
I need to go to the mall, and you know your father now,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
he takes a nap in the afternoon, and I got to go.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.330
I got an errand to run."

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you --

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
Esther, my mother, had stopped driving several years ago,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.330
guys, naturally included flashing, blue lights.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.330
But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.330
and when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well, rapport.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
"Ma'am, did you know that was a light you just ran?"

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
(Spanish)

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
"You don't speak English?"

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
"No."

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.330
(Laughter)

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
But eventually, every dog has its day,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
and she ended up in traffic court,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
where she bartered with the judge for a discount.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
There's a historical marker.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
But now she was a septuagenarian, she'd stopped driving.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.330
And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
to take her to have her hair dyed, you know,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
you know, same color as the Buick.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
Anybody? All right.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.330
Little picks on the legs, where she does her needlepoint, and leaves little loops.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
Rockports -- they're for this.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
That's why they call them that.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.330
(Laughter)

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
This is her ensemble.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
And this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.330
when I have a lot to do, but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.330
I'm not going political on you but ... And so, I go to my mother's.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
I show up. She's in the carport.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.330
Of course, they have a carport.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
The kind with the corrugated roof, you know.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.330
The Buick's parked outside,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
and she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
"I got a surprise for you, baby!"

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
"We taking your car?"

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
"Not we, I."

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.330
And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
Oh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.330
Issued, evidently, by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
Blithering fucking idiots.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.330
(Laughter)

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.330
I said, "Is that thing real?"

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.330
"I think so."

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.330
"Can you even see?"

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.330
"I guess I must."

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.330
"Oh, Jesus."

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
She gets into the car -- she's sitting on two phone books.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
She's engineered an umbrella so she can -- bam! -- slam the door.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
Her daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream cone

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
in the middle of her forehead, is still standing there, slack-jawed.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.330
"You coming? You no coming?"

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
"Oh, my God." I said, "OK, fine. Does pop know you're driving?"

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
"Are you kidding me?"

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.330
"How are you doing it?"

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.330
"He's got to sleep sometime."

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
And so we left my father fast asleep, because I knew he'd kill me

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
if I let her go by herself, and we get in the car.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.330
Puts it in reverse. Fifty-five out of the driveway, in reverse.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
I am buckling in seatbelts from the front.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
I'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
I mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about?

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.330
And she's whistling, and finally I do the kind of

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
birth breathing -- you know, that one?

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
Only a couple of women are going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Right.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.330
And I said, "Ma, would you slow down?"

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
Because now she's picked up the Highway 285,

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
the perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now --

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.330
there's seven lanes, she's on all of them, y'all.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.330
I said, "Ma, pick a lane!"

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
"They give you seven lanes, they expect you to use them."

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
And there she goes, right.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.330
I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
So, I think, hey, we can talk. It'll be a diversion.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
It'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse, maybe.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
"Mommy, I know you have been stopped."

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
"No, no, what you talking about?"

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.330
"You have a license. How long have you been driving?"

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.330
"Four or five days."

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.330
"Yeah. And you haven't been stopped?"

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
"I did not get a ticket."

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.330
I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on."

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
"OK, so I stopped at a light

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
and there's a guy, you know, in the back."

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
"Would this guy have, like, a blue uniform

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
and a terrified look on his face?"

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.330
"You weren't there, don't start."

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
"Come on. You got a ticket?"

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
"No." She explained,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
"The man" -- I have to tell you as she did,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
because it loses something if I don't, you know --

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
"he come to the window, and he does a thing like this,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
which tells me he's pretty old, you know.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
So I look up and I'm thinking,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute."

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.330
"Ma, are you still doing that?"

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
"If it works, it works, baby.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
So, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.'

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
Well, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps."

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
(Laughter)

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
So he's talking to her, and at some point she says,

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.330
"Then, you know, it was it. That was it. It was done."

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
"Yeah? What?

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
He gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?"

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
"No, I look up, and the light, she change."

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.330
(Laughter)

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.330
You should be terrified.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
Now, I don't know if she's toying with me,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
kind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse --

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
left paw, right paw, left paw, right paw --

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
but by now, we've reached the mall.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
Now, you have all been at a mall during the holidays, yes?

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.330
Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.330
Audience: Yes.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.330
Carmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
praying to that saint of perpetual availability

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
some guy's going to turn on the brake lights

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.330
just as you pull up behind him.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
But that doesn't happen most of the time, right?

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
So, first I say, "Ma, why are we here?"

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.330
"You mean, like, in the car?"

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
"No, don't -- why are we here today?

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.330
It's Saturday. It's the holidays."

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.330
"Because I have to exchange your father's underwear."

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.330
Now, see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.330
that you really have to -- you know, in my mind, it's a rabbit's warren,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.330
this woman's mind.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.330
Do I want to walk in, because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor --

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
enough metaphors for you? -- somewhere, I may not get out.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.330
But you know.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.330
(Laughter)

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
"Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now?

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.330
And why? What is wrong with his underwear?"

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.330
"It will upset you."

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
"It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?"

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.330
"No, no, no. The only thing with him is, he's an idiot.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.330
I sent him to the store, which was my first mistake,

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
and he went to buy underwear, and he bought the grippers,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.330
and he's supposed to buy the boxers."

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.330
"Why?"

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
"I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children."

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.330
"Oh, my God!"

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.330
(Laughter)

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.330
Olivia? Huh? Huh?

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.330
By now, we have now crawled another four feet,

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.330
and my mother finally says to me, "I knew it, I knew it.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
I'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you? Right there."

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
And she points out the passenger window, and I look out,

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
and three -- three -- aisles down,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
"Look, the Chevy."

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
You want to laugh, but you don't know --

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
you're that politically corrected, have you noticed?

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.330
Correct the other direction now, it's OK.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.330
"Look, the Chevy -- he's coming this way."

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.330
"Mama, mama, mama, wait, wait, wait. The Chevy is three aisles away."

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
She looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child,

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.330
the cretin, the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.330
"I know that, honey. Get out of the car

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
and go stand in the parking space till I get there."

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.330
OK, I want a vote. Come on, come on. No, no.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
How many of you once in your -- you were a kid, you were an adult --

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone?

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
See, we're a secret club with a secret handshake.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
(Laughter)

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
And years of therapy later, we're doing great.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
We're doing great. We're doing fine.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.330
Well, I stood up to her.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:49.330
This is -- you know, you'd think by now I'm -- and still holding?

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
I said, "No way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life."

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
Of course, her comeback is, "When have I embarrassed you?"

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
(Spanish)

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
And she's still talking while she puts the car in park,

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
hits the emergency brake, opens the door,

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age,

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.330
she jumps out of the car, knocks out the phone books,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.330
and then she walks around --

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.330
she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her --

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
around the front of the car.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
She has amazing land speed for a woman her age, too.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.330
Before I know it, she has skiddled across the parking lot

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.330
and in between the cars, and people behind me, with that kind of

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.330
usual religious charity that the holidays bring us, wah-wah wah-wah.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
"I'm coming." Italian hand signals follow.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
I scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
This is new and fast, just so you -- are you still with us?

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
We'll wait for the slow ones. OK.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
I start, and this is where a child says to me --

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.330
because this is my laconic child.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
A brevity, brevity of everything with this child.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
You know, she eats small portions.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
Language is something to be meted out

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:55.330
in small phonemes, you know -- just little hmm, hmm-hmm.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
She wields great power.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:05.330
She listens, because that's what people who tell stories do first.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
But she pauses occasionally and says,

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.330
"How do you spell that? What year? OK."

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.330
When she writes the expose in about 20 years,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.330
don't believe a word of it.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.330
But this is my daughter, Lauren, my remarkable daughter,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330
my borderline Asperger's kid.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.330
Bless you, Dr. Watson.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.330
She says, "Ma, you got to look!"

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.330
Now, when this kid says I got to look, you know.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.330
But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
I grew up with this woman.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
I said, "Lauren, you know what, give me a play-by-play. I can't."

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.330
"No, mama, you got to look."

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
I got to look. You got to look.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
Don't you want to look?

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
There she is.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.330
I look in bewildered awe:

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
she's standing, those Rockports slightly apart, but grounded.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.330
She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse, and she is wielding it.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:14:01.330
She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:06.330
of her little personality, in that crone-ish voice, saying things like,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.330
"Back it up, buddy! No, it's reserved!"

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.330
(Laughter)

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.330
Ready? Brace yourselves. Here it comes.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
"No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
Honey, sit up so they can see you."

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.330
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.330
I finally come -- and now, it's the South.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
I don't know what part of the country you live in.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
I think we all secretly love stories.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
We all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.330
We want to curl up and say, "Tell it to me, tell it to me.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
Come on, honey, tell it to me."

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
But in the South, we love a good story.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
People have pulled aside,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
I mean, they've come out of that queue line,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
they have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
Bets are placed.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
"I'm with the little lady. Damn!"

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
(Laughter)

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
She is, after all, Cuban.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
I'm thinking, "Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break."

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.330
Like you've never thought that in your life? Right? Yeah.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.330
I pull in. I put the car in park.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.330
Engine's still running -- mine, not the car.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.330
I jump out next to her going, "Don't you move!"

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.330
"I'm not going anywhere."

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.330
She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.330
I come out, and there's Esther.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.330
She's hugging the purse.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
"Que?" Which means "what," and so much more.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:21.330
(Laughter)

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.330
"Ma, have you no shame?

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.330
People are watching us all around," right?

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.330
Now, some of them you've got to make up, people.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.330
Secret of the trade.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.330
Guess what? Some of these stories I sculpt a little, here and there.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.330
Some, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.330
She says this to me.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.330
After I say -- let me refresh you --

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.330
"have you no shame?"

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:51.330
"No. I gave it up with pantyhose -- they're both too binding."

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.330
(Laughter)

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:58.330
(Applause)

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:03.330
Yeah, you can clap, but then you're about 30 seconds from the end.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.330
I'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.330
Intrepid soul.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.330
I'm thinking, "This is my kid. How dare she?

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.330
She jumped out of that car."

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.330
That's OK, because my mother yells at me, I yell at her.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.330
It's a beautiful hierarchy, and it works.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.330
(Laughter)

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.330
I turn around, but it's not a child. It's a young woman,

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.330
a little taller than I, pale green, amused eyes.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.330
With her is a young man -- husband, brother, lover, it's not my job.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.330
And she says, "Pardon me, ma'am" -- that's how we talk down there --

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.330
"is that your mother?"

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.330
I said, "No, I follow little old women around parking lots

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.330
to see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!"

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.330
The boy, now, he says. "Well, what my sister meant" --

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:43.330
they look at each other, it's a knowing glance -- "God, she's crazy!"

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.330
I said, (Spanish), and the young girl and the young boy say,

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.330
"No, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing."

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.330
I said, "Look, please, let me take care of her, OK,

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.330
because I know her, and believe me, she's like a small atomic weapon,

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.330
you know, you just want to handle her really gingerly."

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.330
And the girl goes, "I know, but, I mean, I swear to God,

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.330
she reminds us of our mother."

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.330
I almost miss it.

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.330
He turns to her on the heel of his shoe.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:14.330
It's a half-whisper, "God, I miss her."

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.330
They turn then, shoulder to shoulder, and walk away,

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.330
lost in their own reverie.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.330
Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:30.330
And I turn to Esther, who's rocking on those 'ports, and says,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.330
"You know what, honey?"

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.330
"What, ma?"

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.330
"I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about 14, 15 more years,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:43.330
if you're lucky, but after that, honey, you're going to miss me."

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:52.330
(Applause)
