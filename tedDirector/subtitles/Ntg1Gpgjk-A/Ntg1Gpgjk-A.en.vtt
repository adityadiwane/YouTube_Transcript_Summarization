00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So, I kind of believe that we're in like the "cave-painting" era of computer interfaces.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Like, they're very kind of -- they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and I'd like to change all that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Hit me.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
OK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's very flat, kind of rigid.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
you know, 30 years.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's so much more subtle, so much more visceral

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
-- you know, what's visible, what's not.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So I kind of have a -- this is BumpTop.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So you can bump things -- they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
things collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I can -- let me just grab these guys -- I can turn things into piles

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
instead of just the folders that we have.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
or you know, flip through them like a book

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
or I can lay them out like a deck of cards.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
When they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Also, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Also some of the stuff we can do is,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
for these individual icons we thought -- I mean,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And one of the things I can do is make it bigger

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
if I want to emphasize it and make it more important.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
(Laughter)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Despite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
just like paper. Remember, you know, something for later.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Or if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and, you know, toss it to the corner.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Also just like paper, around our workspace

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and I can do the same thing here,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And I can pull them off when I want to work with them.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
you know, "Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer."

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So one thing we have for that is like a grid align,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
More boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Let's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software --

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -- but browsing photographs.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
okay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And that's BumpTop. Thanks!
