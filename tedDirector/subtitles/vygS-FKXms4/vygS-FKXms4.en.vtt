00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
You know, what I do is write for children,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
and I'm probably America's

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
most widely read children's author, in fact.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And I always tell people

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and no one has ever chose farmer.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
I'm here today to talk to you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
about circles and epiphanies.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And you know, an epiphany

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
You've just got to go around the block

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
to see it as an epiphany.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
That's a painting of a circle.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
It's the kind of complicated circle

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
that I'm going to tell you about.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
My circle began back in the '60s

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
in high school in Stow, Ohio

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
where I was the class queer.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
I was the guy beaten up bloody

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
every week in the boys' room,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
until one teacher saved my life.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
in the teachers' lounge.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
She did it in secret.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
She did it for three years.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And I had to get out of town.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and I ended up in San Francisco, California --

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
met a lover --

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
and back in the '80s, found it necessary

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.260
to begin work on AIDS organizations.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
About three or four years ago,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
I got a phone call in the middle of the night

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
from that teacher, Mrs. Posten,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
who said, "I need to see you.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
I'm disappointed

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
that we never got to know each other as adults.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Could you please come to Ohio,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and please bring that man

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
that I know you have found by now.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And I should mention

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
that I have pancreatic cancer,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and I'd like you to please

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
be quick about this."

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
We found her one, we got her there,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and we took care of her

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and watched over her family,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
because it was necessary.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
It's something we knew how to do.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
got to know me,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
she turned into a box of ashes

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and was placed in my hands.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And what had happened

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
was the circle had closed,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
it had become a circle --

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
and that epiphany I talked about

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
presented itself.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
The epiphany is

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
that death is a part of life.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
She saved my life;

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.260
I and my partner saved hers.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And you know, that part of life needs everything

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
that the rest of life does.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
It needs truth and beauty,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
It also needs --

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
it needs dignity,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
love and pleasure,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and it's our job to hand those things out.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Thank you.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.260
(Applause)
