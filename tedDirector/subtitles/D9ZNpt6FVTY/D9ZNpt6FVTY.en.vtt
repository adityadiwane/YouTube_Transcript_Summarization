00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:17.001
"When I become famous,
I will tell everyone

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:19.159
that I know a hero named Marlon Peterson."

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:21.758
Heroes rarely look like me.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:23.854
In fact,

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:25.558
I'm what garbage looks like.

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:28.966
No, not the most appealing
way to open a talk

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.687
or start a conversation,

00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:34.184
and perhaps you have some questions
going through your head about that.

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:36.582
Why would this man say
such a thing about himself?

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:38.079
What does he mean?

00:00:38.103 --> 00:00:42.289
How can someone view him as a hero
when he sees himself as garbage?

00:00:43.073 --> 00:00:46.156
I believe we learn more from questions
than we do from answers.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.463
Because when we're questioning something,

00:00:48.487 --> 00:00:51.821
we're invested in taking in
some sort of new information,

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:56.082
or grappling with some sort of ignorance
that makes us feel uncomfortable.

00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:57.812
And that's why I'm here:

00:00:57.836 --> 00:00:59.371
to push us to question,

00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:01.470
even when it makes us uncomfortable.

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.032
My parents are from Trinidad and Tobago,

00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:07.269
the southernmost island in the Caribbean.

00:01:07.293 --> 00:01:10.271
Trinidad is also home
to the only acoustic instrument

00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:12.165
invented in the 20th century:

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:13.472
the steel pan.

00:01:14.138 --> 00:01:16.531
Deriving from the African drums

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:19.832
and evolving from the genius
of one of the ghettos in Trinidad,

00:01:19.856 --> 00:01:21.542
a city called Laventille,

00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.542
and the disregard
of the American military ...

00:01:25.357 --> 00:01:26.653
Well, I should tell you,

00:01:26.677 --> 00:01:30.044
America, during WWII, had
military bases set up in Trinidad,

00:01:30.068 --> 00:01:31.489
and when the war ended,

00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:35.049
they left the island littered
with empty oil drums --

00:01:35.073 --> 00:01:36.318
their trash.

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:41.051
So people from Laventille
repurposed the old drums left behind

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:43.278
into the full chromatic scale:

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:44.510
the steel pan.

00:01:44.907 --> 00:01:49.291
Playing music now from Beethoven
to Bob Marley to 50 Cent,

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:53.553
those people literally made
music out of garbage.

00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:57.073
Twelve days before my 20th birthday,

00:01:57.097 --> 00:02:00.968
I was arrested for my role
in a violent robbery attempt

00:02:00.992 --> 00:02:02.204
in lower Manhattan.

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:05.017
While people were sitting
in a coffee shop,

00:02:06.172 --> 00:02:07.539
four people were shot.

00:02:09.192 --> 00:02:10.519
Two were killed.

00:02:11.504 --> 00:02:12.945
Five of us were arrested.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.671
We were all the products
of Trinidad and Tobago.

00:02:16.695 --> 00:02:18.604
We were the "bad immigrants,"

00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:22.664
or the "anchor babies" that Trump
and millions of Americans easily malign.

00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:26.781
I was discarded, like waste material --

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:29.009
and justifiably so to many.

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:33.042
I eventually served 10 years, two months
and seven days of a prison sentence.

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:38.922
I was sentenced to a decade of punishment
in a correctional institution.

00:02:39.786 --> 00:02:42.330
I was sentenced to irrelevance --

00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:43.997
the opposite of humanity.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.630
Interestingly,

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:51.677
it was during those years in prison
that a series of letters redeemed me,

00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:54.540
helped me move beyond
the darkness and the guilt

00:02:54.564 --> 00:02:57.452
associated with the worst
moment of my young life.

00:02:58.025 --> 00:02:59.875
It gave me a sense that I was useful.

00:03:00.758 --> 00:03:02.742
She was 13 years old.

00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:05.704
She had wrote that she saw me as a hero.

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:07.706
I remember reading that,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.457
and I remember crying
when I read those words.

00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:13.678
She was one of over 50 students

00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:17.752
and 150 letters that I wrote during
a mentoring correspondence program

00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:19.386
that I co-designed with a friend

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.740
who was a teacher
at a middle school in Brooklyn,

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:22.920
my hometown.

00:03:22.944 --> 00:03:25.000
We called it the Young Scholars Program.

00:03:25.693 --> 00:03:29.415
Every time those young people
shared their stories with me,

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.046
their struggles,

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.843
every time they drew a picture
of their favorite cartoon character

00:03:34.867 --> 00:03:36.302
and sent it to me,

00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:40.696
every time they said they depended
on my letters or my words of advice,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.619
it boosted my sense of worthiness.

00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:46.736
It gave me a sense of what
I could contribute to this planet.

00:03:47.328 --> 00:03:48.773
It transformed my life.

00:03:49.368 --> 00:03:52.266
Because of those letters
and what they shared with me,

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.155
their stories of teen life,

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:56.249
they gave me the permission,

00:03:56.273 --> 00:03:58.689
they gave me the courage
to admit to myself

00:03:58.713 --> 00:04:01.516
that there were reasons -- not excuses --

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.953
but that there were reasons
for that fateful day in October of 1999;

00:04:06.617 --> 00:04:09.259
that the trauma associated
with living in a community

00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:11.457
where guns are easier
to get than sneakers;

00:04:12.612 --> 00:04:18.631
that the trauma associated with being
raped at gunpoint at the age of 14;

00:04:19.427 --> 00:04:22.124
that those are reasons for me

00:04:22.148 --> 00:04:23.938
why making that decision,

00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:25.127
that fatal decision,

00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:27.115
was not an unlikely proposition.

00:04:28.012 --> 00:04:30.719
Because those letters
mattered so much to me,

00:04:30.743 --> 00:04:32.151
because writing and receiving

00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:34.432
and having that communication
with those folks

00:04:34.456 --> 00:04:35.955
so hugely impacted my life,

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.861
I decided to share the opportunity
with some friends of mine

00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:40.281
who were also inside with me.

00:04:40.305 --> 00:04:42.262
My friends Bill and Cory and Arocks,

00:04:42.286 --> 00:04:44.510
all in prison for violent crimes also,

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:47.338
shared their words of wisdom
with the young people as well,

00:04:47.362 --> 00:04:49.623
and received the sense
of relevancy in return.

00:04:50.142 --> 00:04:53.328
We are now published writers
and youth program innovators

00:04:53.352 --> 00:04:55.101
and trauma experts

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:56.994
and gun violence prevention advocates,

00:04:57.018 --> 00:04:58.396
and TED talkers and --

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.446
(Laughter)

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.924
and good daddies.

00:05:00.948 --> 00:05:03.763
That's what I call a positive
return of investment.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.720
Above all else,

00:05:05.744 --> 00:05:09.647
what building that program
taught me was that when we sow,

00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:13.433
when we invest in the humanity
of people no matter where they're at,

00:05:13.457 --> 00:05:15.922
we can reap amazing rewards.

00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:19.146
In this latest era
of criminal justice reform,

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.094
I often question and wonder why --

00:05:22.812 --> 00:05:24.345
why is it that so many believe

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:27.835
that only those who have been convicted
of nonviolent drug offenses

00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:31.669
merit empathy and recognized humanity?

00:05:32.908 --> 00:05:35.385
Criminal justice reform is human justice.

00:05:35.813 --> 00:05:37.288
Am I not human?

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.178
When we invest in resources
that amplify the relevancy of people

00:05:43.202 --> 00:05:44.672
in communities like Laventille

00:05:44.696 --> 00:05:46.845
or parts of Brooklyn or a ghetto near you,

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:49.541
we can literally create
the communities that we want.

00:05:50.044 --> 00:05:51.423
We can do better.

00:05:51.447 --> 00:05:55.035
We can do better than investing solely
in law enforcement as a resource,

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:57.956
because they don't give us
a sense of relevancy

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.530
that is at the core of why so many of us
do so many harmful things

00:06:01.554 --> 00:06:04.226
in the pursuit of mattering.

00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:09.225
See, gun violence is just a visible
display of a lot of underlying traumas.

00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:13.295
When we invest in the redemptive
value of relevancy,

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:17.711
we can render a return of both
personal responsibility and healing.

00:06:18.124 --> 00:06:20.368
That's the people work I care about,

00:06:20.392 --> 00:06:21.824
because people work.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:27.061
Family, I'm asking you
to do the hard work,

00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:28.533
the difficult work,

00:06:28.557 --> 00:06:31.492
the churning work of bestowing
undeserved kindness

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.963
upon those who we can relegate as garbage,

00:06:33.987 --> 00:06:36.155
who we can disregard and discard easily.

00:06:36.843 --> 00:06:38.169
I'm asking myself.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.250
Over the past two months,

00:06:41.274 --> 00:06:43.368
I've lost two friends to gun violence,

00:06:43.961 --> 00:06:45.659
both innocent bystanders.

00:06:46.748 --> 00:06:49.835
One was caught in a drive-by
while walking home.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.033
The other was sitting in a café
while eating breakfast,

00:06:54.057 --> 00:06:55.758
while on vacation in Miami.

00:06:57.595 --> 00:07:00.913
I'm asking myself to see
the redemptive value of relevancy

00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:02.639
in the people that murdered them,

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:06.014
because of the hard work
of seeing the value in me.

00:07:06.671 --> 00:07:10.805
I'm pushing us to challenge
our own capacity

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:13.194
to fully experience our humanity,

00:07:13.218 --> 00:07:15.207
by understanding the full biography

00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:18.276
of people who we can
easily choose not to see,

00:07:19.728 --> 00:07:22.945
because heroes are waiting
to be recognized,

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:24.805
and music is waiting to be made.

00:07:25.656 --> 00:07:26.924
Thank you.

00:07:26.948 --> 00:07:30.886
(Applause)
