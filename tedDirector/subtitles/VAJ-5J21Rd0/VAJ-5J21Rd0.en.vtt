00:00:15.997 --> 00:00:18.426
Human beings start putting each other into boxes

00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:20.243
the second that they see each other --

00:00:20.243 --> 00:00:23.313
Is that person dangerous? Are they attractive?

00:00:23.313 --> 00:00:26.579
Are they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity?

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.113
We do this little interrogation when we meet people

00:00:29.113 --> 00:00:31.280
to make a mental resume for them.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.797
What's your name? Where are you from?

00:00:32.797 --> 00:00:36.158
How old are you? What do you do?

00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:38.959
Then we get more personal with it.

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:42.107
Have you ever had any diseases?

00:00:42.107 --> 00:00:44.094
Have you ever been divorced?

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:47.540
Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now?

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.257
What are you into? Who are you into?

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:51.123
What gender do you like to sleep with?

00:00:51.123 --> 00:00:53.553
I get it.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.305
We are neurologically hardwired

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.689
to seek out people like ourselves.

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:59.874
We start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough

00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:01.807
to know what acceptance feels like.

00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:04.157
We bond together based on anything that we can --

00:01:04.157 --> 00:01:09.609
music preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on.

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:16.497
We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices.

00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:18.958
Sometimes, though, just the question "what do you do?"

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.918
can feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box

00:01:20.918 --> 00:01:22.447
and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it.

00:01:22.447 --> 00:01:26.014
Because the categories, I've found, are too limiting.

00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:27.898
The boxes are too narrow.

00:01:27.898 --> 00:01:30.015
And this can get really dangerous.

00:01:30.015 --> 00:01:31.796
So here's a disclaimer about me, though,

00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:33.398
before we get too deep into this.

00:01:33.398 --> 00:01:36.383
I grew up in a very sheltered environment.

00:01:36.383 --> 00:01:40.329
I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s,

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.224
two blocks from the epicenter of punk music.

00:01:44.224 --> 00:01:46.314
I was shielded from the pains of bigotry

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:50.414
and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing.

00:01:50.414 --> 00:01:53.835
Where I come from, if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker

00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:55.963
or a performance artist of some kind,

00:01:55.963 --> 00:01:57.947
you were the weirdo.

00:01:57.947 --> 00:01:59.230
(Laughter)

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.315
It was an unorthodox upbringing,

00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:03.826
but as a kid on the streets of New York,

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:05.797
you learn how to trust your own instincts,

00:02:05.797 --> 00:02:08.730
you learn how to go with your own ideas.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.969
So when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy.

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.436
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them.

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:16.869
They said they wouldn't let girls play.

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.279
So I went home, and I shaved my head,

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.901
and I came back the next day and I said, "I'm a boy."

00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:21.915
I mean, who knows, right?

00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:25.728
When you're six, maybe you can do that.

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:29.361
I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn't.

00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:32.003
I kept up the charade for eight years.

00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:36.170
So this is me when I was 11.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.681
I was playing a kid named Walter

00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:39.870
in a movie called "Julian Po."

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.304
I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him.

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:45.354
See, I was also a child actor,

00:02:45.354 --> 00:02:48.036
which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity,

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:54.124
because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy.

00:02:54.124 --> 00:02:57.240
In fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl --

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.556
not my teachers at school, not my friends,

00:02:59.556 --> 00:03:01.408
not the directors that I worked with.

00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:03.673
Kids would often come up to me in class

00:03:03.673 --> 00:03:05.907
and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple

00:03:05.907 --> 00:03:09.256
or grab my crotch to check what I was working with.

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:11.617
When I would go to the bathroom, I would turn my shoes around in the stalls

00:03:11.617 --> 00:03:14.172
so that it looked like I was peeing standing up.

00:03:14.172 --> 00:03:16.240
At sleepovers I would have panic attacks

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.624
trying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me

00:03:18.624 --> 00:03:20.356
without outing myself.

00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:22.408
It's worth mentioning though

00:03:22.408 --> 00:03:26.257
that I didn't hate my body or my genitalia.

00:03:26.257 --> 00:03:28.024
I didn't feel like I was in the wrong body.

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:30.056
I felt like I was performing this elaborate act.

00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:33.883
I wouldn't have qualified as transgender.

00:03:33.883 --> 00:03:36.129
If my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy,

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.852
they probably would have diagnosed me

00:03:37.852 --> 00:03:39.638
as something like gender dysmorphic

00:03:39.638 --> 00:03:42.041
and put me on hormones to stave off puberty.

00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:42.925
But in my particular case,

00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:44.640
I just woke up one day when I was 14,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.223
and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again.

00:03:47.223 --> 00:03:50.223
Puberty had hit, and I had no idea what being a girl meant,

00:03:50.223 --> 00:03:53.848
and I was ready to figure out who I actually was.

00:03:53.848 --> 00:03:56.253
When a kid behaves like I did,

00:03:56.253 --> 00:03:58.089
they don't exactly have to come out, right?

00:03:58.089 --> 00:04:00.350
No one is exactly shocked.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.094
(Laughter)

00:04:04.094 --> 00:04:08.557
But I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents.

00:04:08.557 --> 00:04:10.423
When I was 15, and I called my father

00:04:10.423 --> 00:04:12.123
to tell him that I had fallen in love,

00:04:12.123 --> 00:04:14.423
it was the last thing on either of our minds

00:04:14.423 --> 00:04:16.039
to discuss what the consequences were

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.457
of the fact that my first love was a girl.

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:20.739
Three years later, when I fell in love with a man,

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.323
neither of my parents batted an eyelash either.

00:04:23.323 --> 00:04:26.706
See, it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood

00:04:26.706 --> 00:04:28.740
that I wasn't ever asked to define myself

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.087
as any one thing at any point.

00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:34.906
I was just allowed to be me, growing and changing in every moment.

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:37.951
So four, almost five years ago,

00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:41.266
Proposition 8, the great marriage equality debate,

00:04:41.266 --> 00:04:43.241
was raising a lot of dust around this country.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.852
And at the time, getting married wasn't really something

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:46.985
I spent a lot of time thinking about.

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:49.791
But I was struck by the fact that America,

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:51.856
a country with such a tarnished civil rights record,

00:04:51.856 --> 00:04:54.472
could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly.

00:04:54.472 --> 00:04:56.440
And I remember watching the discussion on television

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.241
and thinking how interesting it was

00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:01.272
that the separation of church and state

00:05:01.272 --> 00:05:04.891
was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country,

00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:06.473
between places where people believed in it

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.258
and places where people didn't.

00:05:08.258 --> 00:05:14.506
And then, that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me.

00:05:14.506 --> 00:05:17.624
If this was a war with two disparate sides,

00:05:17.624 --> 00:05:20.405
I, by default, fell on team gay,

00:05:20.405 --> 00:05:23.591
because I certainly wasn't 100 percent straight.

00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:26.840
At the time I was just beginning to emerge

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.757
from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag

00:05:30.757 --> 00:05:32.590
that saw me go from being a boy

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.812
to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes

00:05:35.812 --> 00:05:38.602
to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy,

00:05:38.602 --> 00:05:41.268
over-compensating, boy-chasing girly-girl

00:05:41.268 --> 00:05:45.236
to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was,

00:05:45.236 --> 00:05:47.643
a tomboyish girl

00:05:47.643 --> 00:05:50.852
who liked both boys and girls depending on the person.

00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:56.003
I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls, much like myself,

00:05:56.003 --> 00:05:57.669
who fell kind of between-the-lines --

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.206
girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear,

00:06:01.206 --> 00:06:05.164
girls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish,

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:08.159
girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees,

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.257
girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls

00:06:11.257 --> 00:06:13.106
who all hated being boxed in to anything.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:16.857
I loved these people, and I admired their freedom,

00:06:16.857 --> 00:06:19.790
but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.640
exploded into these raging debates

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.206
where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television.

00:06:27.206 --> 00:06:29.539
And this powerful awareness rolled in over me

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:34.906
that I was a minority, and in my own home country,

00:06:34.906 --> 00:06:37.557
based on one facet of my character.

00:06:37.557 --> 00:06:43.172
I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen.

00:06:43.172 --> 00:06:44.706
I was not an activist.

00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:47.206
I wave no flags in my own life.

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:49.345
But I was plagued by this question:

00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:52.291
How could anyone vote to strip the rights

00:06:52.291 --> 00:06:54.456
of the vast variety of people that I knew

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.890
based on one element of their character?

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.406
How could they say that we as a group

00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:02.339
were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else?

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.706
Were we even a group? What group?

00:07:04.706 --> 00:07:08.573
And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination?

00:07:08.573 --> 00:07:12.616
Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was?

00:07:12.616 --> 00:07:14.507
And then it occurred to me,

00:07:14.507 --> 00:07:16.790
perhaps if they could look into the eyes

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.571
of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship

00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:22.473
it might make it harder for them to do.

00:07:22.473 --> 00:07:24.457
It might give them pause.

00:07:24.457 --> 00:07:30.297
Obviously I couldn't get 20 million people to the same dinner party,

00:07:30.297 --> 00:07:34.628
so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically

00:07:34.628 --> 00:07:37.594
without any artifice, without any lighting,

00:07:37.594 --> 00:07:40.828
or without any manipulation of any kind on my part.

00:07:40.828 --> 00:07:43.578
Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers

00:07:43.578 --> 00:07:46.294
without the fear of him ripping your face off.

00:07:46.294 --> 00:07:49.691
For me, photography is not just about exposing film,

00:07:49.691 --> 00:07:51.644
it's about exposing the viewer

00:07:51.644 --> 00:07:53.745
to something new, a place they haven't gone before,

00:07:53.745 --> 00:07:57.060
but most importantly, to people that they might be afraid of.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.904
Life magazine introduced generations of people

00:07:58.904 --> 00:08:02.978
to distant, far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures.

00:08:02.978 --> 00:08:09.211
So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits,

00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:10.961
mugshots if you will.

00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:14.729
And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:17.130
that was not 100 percent straight,

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.313
which, if you don't know, is a limitless number of people.

00:08:20.313 --> 00:08:22.363
(Laughter)

00:08:22.363 --> 00:08:25.029
So this was a very large undertaking,

00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:26.913
and to do it we needed some help.

00:08:26.913 --> 00:08:29.446
So I ran out in the freezing cold,

00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:32.854
and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to

00:08:32.854 --> 00:08:36.824
in February of about two years ago.

00:08:36.824 --> 00:08:40.947
And I took those photographs, and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help.

00:08:40.947 --> 00:08:43.313
And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York.

00:08:43.313 --> 00:08:46.324
And then we made this.

00:08:46.324 --> 00:08:58.601
(Music)

00:08:58.601 --> 00:09:02.784
Video: I'm iO Tillett Wright, and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City.

00:09:02.784 --> 00:09:16.092
(Music)

00:09:16.092 --> 00:09:20.754
Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today.

00:09:20.754 --> 00:09:22.377
My aim is to take a simple portrait

00:09:22.377 --> 00:09:25.027
of anyone who's anything other than 100 percent straight

00:09:25.027 --> 00:09:30.247
or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way.

00:09:30.247 --> 00:09:33.245
My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us

00:09:33.245 --> 00:09:35.363
through the simplicity of a face.

00:09:35.363 --> 00:09:38.051
(Music)

00:09:38.051 --> 00:09:41.141
"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."

00:09:41.141 --> 00:09:43.558
It's written in the Declaration of Independence.

00:09:43.558 --> 00:09:44.825
We are failing as a nation

00:09:44.825 --> 00:09:46.934
to uphold the morals upon which we were founded.

00:09:46.934 --> 00:09:49.141
There is no equality in the United States.

00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:51.539
["What does equality mean to you?"]

00:09:51.539 --> 00:09:53.177
["Marriage"] ["Freedom"] ["Civil rights"]

00:09:53.177 --> 00:09:55.303
["Treat every person as you'd treat yourself"]

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:58.923
It's when you don't have to think about it, simple as that.

00:09:58.923 --> 00:10:01.713
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage.

00:10:01.713 --> 00:10:05.809
Today in 29 states, more than half of this country,

00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:10.180
you can legally be fired just for your sexuality.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.331
["Who is responsible for equality?"]

00:10:13.331 --> 00:10:16.342
I've heard hundreds of people give the same answer:

00:10:16.342 --> 00:10:19.818
"We are all responsible for equality."

00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:22.671
So far we've shot 300 faces in New York City.

00:10:22.671 --> 00:10:24.087
And we wouldn't have been able to do any of it

00:10:24.087 --> 00:10:26.972
without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign.

00:10:26.972 --> 00:10:28.921
I want to take the project across the country.

00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:33.004
I want to visit 25 American cities, and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people.

00:10:33.004 --> 00:10:36.987
This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation.

00:10:36.987 --> 00:10:39.164
I challenge you to look into the faces of these people

00:10:39.164 --> 00:10:42.026
and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being.

00:10:42.026 --> 00:10:44.066
(Music)

00:10:44.066 --> 00:10:46.333
["Self evident truths"]

00:10:46.348 --> 00:10:48.012
["4,000 faces across America"]

00:10:48.013 --> 00:10:52.569
(Music)

00:10:52.569 --> 00:11:00.817
(Applause)

00:11:00.817 --> 00:11:05.100
iO Tillett Wright: Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.350
Almost 85,000 people watched that video,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.850
and then they started emailing us from all over the country,

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.517
asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces.

00:11:15.517 --> 00:11:19.867
And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated.

00:11:19.867 --> 00:11:23.368
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces.

00:11:23.368 --> 00:11:27.433
That video was made in the spring of 2011,

00:11:27.433 --> 00:11:30.890
and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.796
and photographed almost 2,000 people.

00:11:33.796 --> 00:11:36.806
I know that this is a talk,

00:11:36.806 --> 00:11:40.072
but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet

00:11:40.072 --> 00:11:41.321
and have you just look at these faces

00:11:41.321 --> 00:11:45.191
because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them.

00:11:45.191 --> 00:11:47.724
Because if a picture is worth a thousand words,

00:11:47.724 --> 00:11:51.063
then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary.

00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:16.008
So after traveling and talking to people

00:12:16.008 --> 00:12:19.856
in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas,

00:12:19.856 --> 00:12:23.391
we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on.

00:12:23.391 --> 00:12:25.277
Visibility really is key.

00:12:25.277 --> 00:12:28.540
Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.990
Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family,

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.907
you're far more likely to explore sympathy for it

00:12:34.907 --> 00:12:36.473
or explore a new perspective on it.

00:12:36.473 --> 00:12:39.124
Of course, in my travels I met people

00:12:39.124 --> 00:12:43.323
who legally divorced their children for being other than straight,

00:12:43.323 --> 00:12:45.691
but I also met people who were Southern Baptists

00:12:45.691 --> 00:12:48.707
who switched churches because their child was a lesbian.

00:12:48.707 --> 00:12:52.857
Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths.

00:12:52.857 --> 00:12:56.273
But here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting:

00:12:56.273 --> 00:13:00.623
Self Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us.

00:13:00.623 --> 00:13:04.007
In fact, on the contrary, it highlights them.

00:13:04.007 --> 00:13:06.106
It presents, not just the complexities

00:13:06.106 --> 00:13:08.273
found in a procession of different human beings,

00:13:08.273 --> 00:13:11.873
but the complexities found within each individual person.

00:13:11.873 --> 00:13:16.758
It wasn't that we had too many boxes, it was that we had too few.

00:13:22.778 --> 00:13:29.563
At some point I realized that my mission to photograph "gays" was inherently flawed,

00:13:29.563 --> 00:13:32.751
because there were a million different shades of gay.

00:13:32.751 --> 00:13:35.497
Here I was trying to help,

00:13:35.497 --> 00:13:38.690
and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid --

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.196
yet another box.

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:44.416
At some point I added a question to the release form

00:13:44.416 --> 00:13:46.345
that asked people to quantify themselves

00:13:46.345 --> 00:13:49.145
on a scale of one to 100 percent gay.

00:13:49.145 --> 00:13:53.061
And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me.

00:13:53.061 --> 00:13:55.862
(Laughter)

00:13:55.862 --> 00:13:57.062
People didn't know what to do

00:13:57.062 --> 00:13:59.465
because they had never been presented with the option before.

00:13:59.465 --> 00:14:01.652
Can you quantify your openness?

00:14:01.652 --> 00:14:03.562
Once they got over the shock, though,

00:14:03.562 --> 00:14:07.645
by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent

00:14:07.645 --> 00:14:10.162
or the 3 to 20 percent marks.

00:14:10.162 --> 00:14:12.863
Of course, there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other,

00:14:12.863 --> 00:14:15.331
but I found that a much larger proportion of people

00:14:15.331 --> 00:14:18.180
identified as something that was much more nuanced.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:24.389
I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as "Grey."

00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:28.373
Let me be clear though -- and this is very important --

00:14:28.373 --> 00:14:33.089
in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist.

00:14:33.089 --> 00:14:37.889
And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative,

00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:40.756
because if any of you happen to be of the belief

00:14:40.756 --> 00:14:42.623
that sexual orientation is a choice,

00:14:42.623 --> 00:14:44.156
I invite you to go out and try to be grey.

00:14:44.156 --> 00:14:46.422
I'll take your picture just for trying.

00:14:46.422 --> 00:14:47.805
(Laughter)

00:14:47.805 --> 00:14:52.222
What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional.

00:14:52.222 --> 00:14:57.990
The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this:

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.207
If you have gay people over here

00:15:00.207 --> 00:15:03.855
and you have straight people over here,

00:15:03.855 --> 00:15:06.823
and while we recognize that most people identify

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:09.526
as somewhere closer to one binary or another,

00:15:09.526 --> 00:15:14.472
there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between.

00:15:14.472 --> 00:15:17.506
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one.

00:15:17.506 --> 00:15:19.790
Because, for example, if you pass a law

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.293
that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior,

00:15:23.293 --> 00:15:26.060
where exactly do you draw the line?

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:31.926
Is it over here, by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far?

00:15:31.926 --> 00:15:33.227
Or is it over here

00:15:33.227 --> 00:15:37.326
by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far?

00:15:37.326 --> 00:15:41.976
Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen?

00:15:41.976 --> 00:15:46.792
Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels

00:15:46.792 --> 00:15:51.094
is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is.

00:15:51.094 --> 00:15:53.705
After traveling so much and meeting so many people,

00:15:53.705 --> 00:15:57.210
let me tell you, there are just as many jerks and sweethearts

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.159
and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:03.109
and every other polarization you can possibly think of

00:16:03.109 --> 00:16:05.243
within the LGBT community

00:16:05.243 --> 00:16:08.759
as there are within the human race.

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:13.377
Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs,

00:16:13.377 --> 00:16:17.042
and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle,

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:18.443
just being other than straight

00:16:18.443 --> 00:16:23.459
doesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common.

00:16:23.459 --> 00:16:31.860
So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.059
as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms,

00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:40.518
bus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers,

00:16:40.518 --> 00:16:43.593
perhaps in watching this procession of humanity,

00:16:43.593 --> 00:16:46.510
something interesting and useful will begin to happen.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:50.227
Hopefully these categories, these binaries,

00:16:50.227 --> 00:16:51.976
these over-simplified boxes

00:16:51.976 --> 00:16:57.042
will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away.

00:16:57.042 --> 00:17:00.460
Because really, they describe nothing that we see

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.809
and no one that we know and nothing that we are.

00:17:03.809 --> 00:17:09.410
What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.993
And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity.

00:17:12.993 --> 00:17:17.334
At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights.

00:17:17.334 --> 00:17:20.893
So is it me particularly

00:17:20.893 --> 00:17:24.395
that you would choose to deny the right to housing,

00:17:24.395 --> 00:17:27.376
the right to adopt children, the right to marriage,

00:17:27.376 --> 00:17:31.009
the freedom to shop here, live here, buy here?

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:33.088
Am I the one that you choose to disown

00:17:33.088 --> 00:17:37.510
as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father,

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.858
your neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president,

00:17:39.858 --> 00:17:43.308
your police woman or the fireman?

00:17:43.308 --> 00:17:46.326
It's too late.

00:17:46.326 --> 00:17:49.627
Because I already am all of those things.

00:17:49.627 --> 00:17:53.992
We already are all of those things, and we always have been.

00:17:53.992 --> 00:17:56.798
So please don't greet us as strangers,

00:17:56.798 --> 00:18:00.351
greet us as your fellow human beings, period.

00:18:00.351 --> 00:18:01.667
Thank you.

00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:12.594
(Applause)
