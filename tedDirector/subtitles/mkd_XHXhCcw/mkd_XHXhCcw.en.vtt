00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:17.400
Chris Anderson: Welcome
to this next edition of TED Dialogues.

00:00:17.424 --> 00:00:20.490
We're trying to do
some bridging here today.

00:00:20.514 --> 00:00:23.434
You know, the American dream
has inspired millions of people

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:26.218
around the world for many years.

00:00:26.757 --> 00:00:32.474
Today, I think, you can say
that America is divided,

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:34.159
perhaps more than ever,

00:00:34.183 --> 00:00:36.238
and the divisions seem
to be getting worse.

00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:40.103
It's actually really hard
for people on different sides

00:00:40.127 --> 00:00:41.581
to even have a conversation.

00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:43.917
People almost feel...

00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:45.587
disgusted with each other.

00:00:46.468 --> 00:00:49.692
Some families can't even speak
to each other right now.

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:56.049
Our purpose in this dialogue today
is to try to do something about that,

00:00:56.073 --> 00:00:58.733
to try to have a different kind
of conversation,

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:02.998
to do some listening, some thinking,
some understanding.

00:01:03.022 --> 00:01:06.450
And I have two people with us
to help us do that.

00:01:06.474 --> 00:01:09.713
They're not going to come at this
hammer and tong against each other.

00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:11.501
This is not like cable news.

00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:17.018
This is two people who have both spent
a lot of their working life

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:19.329
in the political center
or right of the center.

00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:23.317
They've immersed themselves
in conservative worldviews, if you like.

00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:25.464
They know that space very well.

00:01:25.488 --> 00:01:27.197
And we're going to explore together

00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:30.242
how to think about
what is happening right now,

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:33.411
and whether we can find new ways to bridge

00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:36.652
and just to have wiser,
more connected conversations.

00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:39.779
With me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson,

00:01:39.803 --> 00:01:45.093
who has spent a decade
working at Fox News,

00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:49.595
hosting "Fox and Friends"
and then "The Real Story,"

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.392
before taking a courageous stance
in filing sexual harassment claims

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:56.632
against Roger Ailes,

00:01:56.656 --> 00:02:00.021
which eventually led
to his departure from Fox News.

00:02:00.482 --> 00:02:03.285
David Brooks, who has earned the wrath

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:06.223
of many of [The New York Times's]
left-leaning readers

00:02:06.247 --> 00:02:09.135
because of his conservative views,

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.093
and more recently, perhaps,
some of the right-leaning readers

00:02:12.117 --> 00:02:15.384
because of his criticism
of some aspects of Trump.

00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:18.544
Yet, his columns are usually

00:02:18.568 --> 00:02:22.964
the top one, two or three
most-read content of the day

00:02:22.988 --> 00:02:24.228
because they're brilliant,

00:02:24.252 --> 00:02:26.551
because they bring psychology
and social science

00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:30.028
to providing understanding
for what's going on.

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:33.325
So without further ado, a huge welcome
to Gretchen and David.

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.507
Come and join me.

00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:38.244
(Applause)

00:02:38.268 --> 00:02:40.634
So, Gretchen.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:45.349
Sixty-three million Americans
voted for Donald Trump.

00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:48.039
Why did they do this?

00:02:48.063 --> 00:02:51.583
Gretchen Carlson: There are a lot
of reasons, in my mind, why it happened.

00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:54.882
I mean, I think it was a movement
of sorts, but it started long ago.

00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:56.714
It didn't just happen overnight.

00:02:56.738 --> 00:02:59.649
"Anger" would be the first word
that I would think of --

00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:03.936
anger with nothing
being done in Washington,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.024
anger about not being heard.

00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:10.191
I think there was a huge swath
of the population

00:03:10.215 --> 00:03:12.964
that feels like Washington
never listens to them,

00:03:12.988 --> 00:03:17.222
you know, a good part of the middle
of America, not just the coasts,

00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:21.455
and he was somebody they felt
was listening to their concerns.

00:03:21.976 --> 00:03:26.202
So I think those two issues
would be the main reason.

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:28.276
I have to throw in there also celebrity.

00:03:29.212 --> 00:03:34.878
I think that had a huge impact
on Donald Trump becoming president.

00:03:34.902 --> 00:03:37.532
CA: Was the anger justified?

00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:39.444
David Brooks: Yeah, I think so.

00:03:39.468 --> 00:03:43.542
In 2015 and early 2016,
I wrote about 30 columns

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:44.917
with the following theme:

00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:47.928
don't worry, Donald Trump will never
be the Republican nominee.

00:03:47.952 --> 00:03:49.112
(Laughter)

00:03:49.136 --> 00:03:51.334
And having done that
and gotten that so wrong,

00:03:51.358 --> 00:03:54.542
I decided to spend the ensuing year
just out in Trumpworld,

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:57.436
and I found a lot of economic dislocation.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.030
I ran into a woman in West Virginia
who was going to a funeral for her mom.

00:04:01.054 --> 00:04:04.522
She said, "The nice thing about
being Catholic is we don't have to speak,

00:04:04.546 --> 00:04:06.818
and that's good,
because we're not word people."

00:04:06.842 --> 00:04:08.824
That phrase rung in my head: word people.

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:11.624
A lot of us in the TED community
are word people,

00:04:11.648 --> 00:04:14.775
but if you're not, the economy
has not been angled toward you,

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.436
and so 11 million men, for example,
are out of the labor force

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.069
because those jobs are done away.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.633
A lot of social injury.

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:24.954
You used to be able to say,
"I'm not the richest person in the world,

00:04:24.978 --> 00:04:26.196
I'm not the most famous,

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.525
but my neighbors can count on me
and I get some dignity out of that."

00:04:29.549 --> 00:04:33.103
And because of celebritification
or whatever, if you're not rich or famous,

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:34.285
you feel invisible.

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:37.621
And a lot of moral injury,
sense of feeling betrayed,

00:04:37.645 --> 00:04:41.500
and frankly, in this country,
we almost have one success story,

00:04:41.524 --> 00:04:45.094
which is you go to college, get
a white-collar job, and you're a success,

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.206
and if you don't fit in that formula,

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.987
you feel like you're not respected.

00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:50.829
And so that accumulation of things --

00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:53.045
and when I talked to Trump
voters and still do,

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.754
I found most of them completely
realistic about his failings,

00:04:56.778 --> 00:04:58.416
but they said, this is my shot.

00:04:59.154 --> 00:05:02.400
GC: And yet I predicted
that he would be the nominee,

00:05:02.424 --> 00:05:04.608
because I've known him for 27 years.

00:05:04.632 --> 00:05:06.422
He's a master marketer,

00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:08.449
and one of the things
he did extremely well

00:05:08.473 --> 00:05:10.667
that President Obama also did
extremely well,

00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:12.729
was simplifying the message,

00:05:12.753 --> 00:05:15.541
simplifying down to phrases

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.614
and to a populist message.

00:05:17.638 --> 00:05:20.363
Even if he can't achieve it,
it sounded good.

00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:24.625
And many people latched on
to that simplicity again.

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:26.594
It's something they could grasp onto:

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:30.015
"I get that. I want that.
That sounds fantastic."

00:05:30.771 --> 00:05:33.695
And I remember when he used to come
on my show originally,

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:36.120
before "The Apprentice"
was even "The Apprentice,"

00:05:36.144 --> 00:05:38.323
and he'd say it was the number
one show on TV.

00:05:38.347 --> 00:05:40.104
I'd say back to him, "No, it's not."

00:05:40.128 --> 00:05:42.038
And he would say, "Yes it is, Gretchen."

00:05:42.062 --> 00:05:43.946
And I would say, "No it's not."

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.505
But people at home would see that,
and they'd be like,

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:49.105
"Wow, I should be watching
the number one show on TV."

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.082
And -- lo and behold -- it became
the number one show on TV.

00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:55.408
So he had this, I've seen
this ability in him

00:05:55.432 --> 00:05:57.630
to be the master marketer.

00:05:57.654 --> 00:06:00.238
CA: It's puzzling
to a lot of people on the left

00:06:00.262 --> 00:06:03.521
that so many women voted for him,

00:06:03.545 --> 00:06:05.082
despite some of his comments.

00:06:05.106 --> 00:06:07.821
GC: I wrote a column
about this for Time Motto,

00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:12.137
saying that I really believe
that lot of people put on blinders,

00:06:13.144 --> 00:06:16.003
and maybe for the first time,

00:06:16.027 --> 00:06:18.799
some people decided
that policies they believed in

00:06:18.823 --> 00:06:21.371
and being heard
and not being invisible anymore

00:06:21.395 --> 00:06:23.346
was more important to them

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.946
than the way in which he had acted
or acts as a human.

00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:29.779
And so human dignity --

00:06:29.803 --> 00:06:33.271
whether it would be the dust-up
about the disabled reporter,

00:06:33.295 --> 00:06:35.835
or what happened
in that audiotape with Billy Bush

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:38.064
and the way in which he spoke
about women --

00:06:39.121 --> 00:06:41.068
they put that aside

00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:43.713
and pretended as if
they hadn't seen that or heard that,

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:47.773
because to them,
policies were more important.

00:06:47.797 --> 00:06:50.608
CA: Right, so just because
someone voted for Trump,

00:06:50.632 --> 00:06:54.359
it's not blind adherence to everything
that he's said or stood for.

00:06:54.383 --> 00:06:57.205
GC: No. I heard a lot of people
that would say to me,

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.292
"Wow, I just wish he would shut up
before the election.

00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:03.018
If he would just stay quiet,
he'd get elected."

00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:06.840
CA: And so, maybe for people on the left
there's a trap there,

00:07:06.864 --> 00:07:12.442
to sort of despise
or just be baffled by the support,

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:15.550
assuming that it's for some
of the unattractive features.

00:07:15.574 --> 00:07:18.119
Actually, maybe they're supporting
him despite those,

00:07:18.143 --> 00:07:19.929
because they see something exciting.

00:07:19.953 --> 00:07:21.295
They see a man of action.

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:26.377
They see the choking hold of government
being thrown off in some way

00:07:26.401 --> 00:07:27.740
and they're excited by that.

00:07:27.764 --> 00:07:31.140
GC: But don't forget we saw that
on the left as well -- Bernie Sanders.

00:07:31.164 --> 00:07:35.118
So this is one of the commonalities
that I think we can talk about today,

00:07:35.142 --> 00:07:38.185
"The Year of the Outsider,"
David -- right?

00:07:38.823 --> 00:07:42.088
And even though Bernie Sanders
has been in Congress for a long time,

00:07:42.112 --> 00:07:44.325
he was deemed an outsider this time.

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:46.691
And so there was anger
on the left as well,

00:07:46.715 --> 00:07:50.166
and so many people were in favor
of Bernie Sanders.

00:07:50.674 --> 00:07:54.562
So I see it as a commonality.

00:07:54.586 --> 00:07:57.165
People who like Trump,
people who like Bernie Sanders,

00:07:57.189 --> 00:08:00.992
they were liking different policies,
but the underpinning was anger.

00:08:01.016 --> 00:08:05.586
CA: David, there's often
this narrative, then,

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.801
that the sole explanation
for Trump's victory and his rise

00:08:10.825 --> 00:08:15.777
is his tapping into anger
in a very visceral way.

00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:20.459
But you've written a bit about
that it's actually more than that,

00:08:20.483 --> 00:08:23.681
that there's a worldview
that's being worked on here.

00:08:23.705 --> 00:08:24.978
Could you talk about that?

00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:27.557
DB: I would say he understood what,
frankly, I didn't,

00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:29.437
which is what debate we were having.

00:08:29.461 --> 00:08:31.894
And so I'd grown up starting with Reagan,

00:08:31.918 --> 00:08:34.822
and it was the big government
versus small government debate.

00:08:34.846 --> 00:08:37.035
It was Barry Goldwater
versus George McGovern,

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:41.164
and that was the debate
we had been having for a generation.

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:45.353
It was: Democrats wanted to use
government to enhance equality,

00:08:45.377 --> 00:08:48.125
Republicans wanted to limit government
to enhance freedom.

00:08:48.149 --> 00:08:49.332
That was the debate.

00:08:49.356 --> 00:08:52.166
He understood what I think
the two major parties did not,

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.134
which was that's not the debate anymore.

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:56.487
The debate is now open versus closed.

00:08:56.511 --> 00:08:59.777
On one side are those who have
the tailwinds of globalization

00:08:59.801 --> 00:09:02.034
and the meritocracy blowing at their back,

00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:04.457
and they tend to favor open trade,

00:09:04.481 --> 00:09:06.466
open borders, open social mores,

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.452
because there are so many opportunities.

00:09:08.476 --> 00:09:11.932
On the other side are those
who feel the headwinds of globalization

00:09:11.956 --> 00:09:14.348
and the meritocracy
just blasting in their faces,

00:09:14.372 --> 00:09:18.303
and they favor closed trade,
closed borders, closed social mores,

00:09:18.327 --> 00:09:20.418
because they just want some security.

00:09:20.442 --> 00:09:22.586
And so he was right
on that fundamental issue,

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.262
and people were willing
to overlook a lot to get there.

00:09:25.286 --> 00:09:27.393
And so he felt that sense of security.

00:09:27.417 --> 00:09:31.746
We're speaking the morning after
Trump's joint session speech.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.596
There are three traditional
groups in the Republican Party.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.398
There are the foreign policies hawks

00:09:36.422 --> 00:09:38.477
who believe in America
as global policeman.

00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:40.354
Trump totally repudiated that view.

00:09:40.378 --> 00:09:42.424
Second, there was the social conservatives

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:44.155
who believed in religious liberty,

00:09:44.179 --> 00:09:46.092
pro-life,

00:09:46.116 --> 00:09:48.585
prayer in schools.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.175
He totally ignored that.

00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:54.634
There was not a single mention
of a single social conservative issue.

00:09:54.658 --> 00:09:56.477
And then there were the fiscal hawks,

00:09:56.501 --> 00:09:59.619
the people who wanted to cut down
on the national debt, Tea Party,

00:09:59.643 --> 00:10:00.949
cut the size of government.

00:10:00.973 --> 00:10:02.828
He's expanding the size of government!

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:06.534
Here's a man who has single-handedly
revolutionized a major American party

00:10:06.558 --> 00:10:09.531
because he understood
where the debate was headed

00:10:09.555 --> 00:10:10.902
before other people.

00:10:10.926 --> 00:10:12.941
And then guys like Steve Bannon come in

00:10:12.965 --> 00:10:14.992
and give him substance to his impulses.

00:10:16.027 --> 00:10:17.796
CA: And so take that a bit further,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.575
and maybe expand a bit more
on your insights

00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:23.862
into Steve Bannon's worldview.

00:10:23.886 --> 00:10:26.618
Because he's sometimes tarred
in very simple terms

00:10:26.642 --> 00:10:33.253
as this dangerous, racist,
xenophobic, anger-sparking person.

00:10:33.277 --> 00:10:37.793
There's more to the story;
that is perhaps an unfair simplification.

00:10:37.817 --> 00:10:39.253
DB: I think that part is true,

00:10:39.277 --> 00:10:41.747
but there's another part
that's probably true, too.

00:10:41.771 --> 00:10:43.931
He's part of a global movement.

00:10:43.955 --> 00:10:46.640
It's like being around Marxists in 1917.

00:10:46.664 --> 00:10:50.860
There's him here, there's the UKIP party,
there's the National Front in France,

00:10:50.884 --> 00:10:53.929
there's Putin, there's a Turkish version,
a Philippine version.

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:57.424
So we have to recognize that this
is a global intellectual movement.

00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:58.663
And it believes

00:10:58.687 --> 00:11:03.944
that wisdom and virtue is not held
in individual conversation and civility

00:11:03.968 --> 00:11:07.370
the way a lot of us
in the enlightenment side of the world do.

00:11:07.394 --> 00:11:10.972
It's held in -- the German word
is the "volk" -- in the people,

00:11:10.996 --> 00:11:13.856
in the common, instinctive wisdom
of the plain people.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:19.498
And the essential virtue of that people
is always being threatened by outsiders.

00:11:19.522 --> 00:11:22.205
And he's got a strategy
for how to get there.

00:11:22.229 --> 00:11:26.257
He's got a series of policies
to bring the people up

00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:28.607
and repudiate the outsiders,

00:11:28.631 --> 00:11:33.400
whether those outsiders
are Islam, Mexicans, the media,

00:11:33.424 --> 00:11:35.294
the coastal elites...

00:11:35.318 --> 00:11:38.631
And there's a whole worldview there;
it's a very coherent worldview.

00:11:38.655 --> 00:11:40.554
I sort of have more respect for him.

00:11:40.578 --> 00:11:43.829
I loathe what he stands for
and I think he's wrong on the substance,

00:11:43.853 --> 00:11:46.560
but it's interesting to see someone
with a set of ideas

00:11:46.584 --> 00:11:48.557
find a vehicle, Donald Trump,

00:11:48.581 --> 00:11:51.699
and then try to take control
of the White House

00:11:51.723 --> 00:11:53.825
in order to advance his viewpoint.

00:11:53.849 --> 00:11:58.675
CA: So it's almost become, like,
that the core question of our time now is:

00:11:58.699 --> 00:12:03.720
Can you be patriotic
but also have a global mindset?

00:12:03.744 --> 00:12:08.015
Are these two things
implacably opposed to each other?

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:11.500
I mean, a lot of conservatives

00:12:11.524 --> 00:12:13.971
and, to the extent
that it's a different category,

00:12:13.995 --> 00:12:15.276
a lot of Trump supporters,

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.226
are infuriated by the coastal elites
and the globalists

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.236
because they see them
as, sort of, not cheering for America,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.922
not embracing fully American values.

00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:29.498
I mean, have you seen that
in your conversations with people,

00:12:29.522 --> 00:12:31.426
in your understanding of their mindset?

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.651
GC: I do think that there's
a huge difference between --

00:12:34.675 --> 00:12:36.657
I hate to put people in categories, but,

00:12:36.681 --> 00:12:40.642
Middle America versus
people who live on the coasts.

00:12:40.666 --> 00:12:42.732
It's an entirely different existence.

00:12:42.756 --> 00:12:46.422
And I grew up in Minnesota, so I have
an understanding of Middle America,

00:12:46.446 --> 00:12:47.802
and I've never forgotten it.

00:12:47.826 --> 00:12:51.333
And maybe that's why I have
an understanding of what happened here,

00:12:51.357 --> 00:12:56.181
because those people often feel
like nobody's listening to them,

00:12:56.205 --> 00:13:00.693
and that we're only concentrating
on California and New York.

00:13:00.717 --> 00:13:05.241
And so I think that was a huge reason
why Trump was elected.

00:13:05.265 --> 00:13:09.353
I mean, these people felt like
they were being heard.

00:13:09.377 --> 00:13:13.527
Whether or not patriotism falls into that,

00:13:13.551 --> 00:13:14.720
I'm not sure about that.

00:13:14.744 --> 00:13:15.915
I do know one thing:

00:13:15.939 --> 00:13:19.994
a lot of things Trump talked about
last night are not conservative things.

00:13:20.018 --> 00:13:22.495
Had Hillary Clinton gotten up
and given that speech,

00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:24.876
not one Republican would have
stood up to applaud.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.527
I mean, he's talking about spending
a trillion dollars on infrastructure.

00:13:28.551 --> 00:13:30.389
That is not a conservative viewpoint.

00:13:30.413 --> 00:13:33.392
He talked about government-mandated
maternity leave.

00:13:34.132 --> 00:13:37.150
A lot of women may love that;
it's not a conservative viewpoint.

00:13:37.174 --> 00:13:38.325
So it's fascinating

00:13:38.349 --> 00:13:42.049
that people who loved what his message
was during the campaign,

00:13:42.073 --> 00:13:44.675
I'm not sure -- how do you
think they'll react to that?

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:46.885
DB: I should say I grew up
in Lower Manhattan,

00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:49.640
in the triangle between ABC Carpets,
the Strand Bookstore

00:13:49.664 --> 00:13:50.978
and The Odeon restaurant.

00:13:51.002 --> 00:13:52.633
(Laughter)

00:13:52.657 --> 00:13:54.511
GC: Come to Minnesota sometime!

00:13:54.535 --> 00:13:55.768
(Laughter)

00:13:55.792 --> 00:14:01.442
CA: You are a card-carrying member
of the coastal elite, my man.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:03.718
But what did you make
of the speech last night?

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:07.189
It seemed to be a move
to a more moderate position,

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:08.364
on the face of it.

00:14:08.388 --> 00:14:10.415
DB: Yeah, I thought it
was his best speech,

00:14:10.439 --> 00:14:12.477
and it took away the freakishness of him.

00:14:12.501 --> 00:14:14.357
I do think he's a moral freak,

00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:17.183
and I think he'll be undone by that fact,

00:14:17.207 --> 00:14:19.986
the fact that he just doesn't know
anything about anything

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.263
and is uncurious about it.

00:14:21.287 --> 00:14:22.380
(Laughter)

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:24.569
But if you take away these minor flaws,

00:14:24.593 --> 00:14:26.665
I think we got to see him at his best,

00:14:26.689 --> 00:14:29.807
and it was revealing for me
to see him at his best,

00:14:29.831 --> 00:14:34.348
because to me, it exposed a central
contradiction that he's got to confront,

00:14:34.372 --> 00:14:37.376
that a lot of what he's doing
is offering security.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.198
So, "I'm ordering closed borders,

00:14:39.222 --> 00:14:42.085
I'm going to secure the world
for you, for my people."

00:14:42.109 --> 00:14:45.157
But then if you actually look
at a lot of his economic policies,

00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:48.962
like health care reform, which is about
private health care accounts,

00:14:48.986 --> 00:14:51.851
that's not security, that's risk.

00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:55.571
Educational vouchers: that's risk.
Deregulation: that's risk.

00:14:55.595 --> 00:14:59.572
There's really a contradiction
between the security of the mindset

00:14:59.596 --> 00:15:02.380
and a lot of the policies,
which are very risk-oriented.

00:15:02.404 --> 00:15:05.905
And what I would say, especially
having spent this year,

00:15:05.929 --> 00:15:09.794
the people in rural Minnesota,
in New Mexico --

00:15:09.818 --> 00:15:11.883
they've got enough risk in their lives.

00:15:11.907 --> 00:15:15.222
And so they're going to say,
"No thank you."

00:15:15.246 --> 00:15:19.014
And I think his health care repeal
will fail for that reason.

00:15:19.038 --> 00:15:21.983
CA: But despite the criticisms
you just made of him,

00:15:22.007 --> 00:15:26.219
it does at least seem that he's listening

00:15:26.243 --> 00:15:28.417
to a surprisingly wide range of voices;

00:15:28.441 --> 00:15:31.212
it's not like everyone
is coming from the same place.

00:15:31.236 --> 00:15:36.496
And maybe that leads to a certain
amount of chaos and confusion, but --

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.742
GC: I actually don't think he's listening
to a wide range of voices.

00:15:39.766 --> 00:15:41.796
I think he's listening to very few people.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.623
That's just my impression of it.

00:15:43.647 --> 00:15:46.102
I believe that some of the things
he said last night

00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:48.149
had Ivanka all over them.

00:15:48.173 --> 00:15:52.087
So I believe he was listening
to her before that speech.

00:15:52.111 --> 00:15:56.334
And he was Teleprompter Trump
last night, as opposed to Twitter Trump.

00:15:56.358 --> 00:15:58.483
And that's why, before we came out here,

00:15:58.507 --> 00:16:02.718
I said, "We better check Twitter
to see if anything's changed."

00:16:02.742 --> 00:16:04.931
And also I think you have to keep in mind

00:16:04.955 --> 00:16:08.138
that because he's such a unique character,

00:16:08.162 --> 00:16:11.007
what was the bar that we
were expecting last night?

00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:13.887
Was it here or here or here?

00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:17.673
And so he comes out
and gives a looking political speech,

00:16:17.697 --> 00:16:21.085
and everyone goes, "Wow! He can do it."

00:16:21.109 --> 00:16:23.131
It just depends
on which direction he goes.

00:16:23.155 --> 00:16:25.520
DB: Yeah, and we're trying
to build bridges here,

00:16:25.544 --> 00:16:28.581
and especially for an audience
that may have contempt for Trump,

00:16:28.605 --> 00:16:30.854
it's important to say,
no, this is a real thing.

00:16:30.878 --> 00:16:34.732
But as I try my best to go an hour
showing respect for him,

00:16:34.756 --> 00:16:36.747
my thyroid is surging,

00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:40.143
because I think the oddities
of his character

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:42.648
really are condemnatory
and are going to doom him.

00:16:42.672 --> 00:16:48.130
CA: Your reputation is as a conservative.

00:16:48.154 --> 00:16:50.528
People would you describe you
as right of center,

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:54.785
and yet here you are
with this visceral reaction against him

00:16:54.809 --> 00:16:56.435
and some of what he stands for.

00:16:56.459 --> 00:17:00.086
I mean, I'm -- how do you have
a conversation?

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.039
The people who support him,
on evidence so far,

00:17:03.063 --> 00:17:05.255
are probably pretty excited.

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:10.437
He's certainly shown real engagement

00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:12.577
in a lot of what he promised to do,

00:17:12.601 --> 00:17:16.702
and there is a strong desire
to change the system radically.

00:17:16.726 --> 00:17:20.856
People hate what government has become
and how it's left them out.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.662
GC: I totally agree with that,

00:17:22.686 --> 00:17:26.353
but I think that when he was proposing
a huge government program last night

00:17:26.377 --> 00:17:30.445
that we used to call the bad s-word,
"stimulus," I find it completely ironic.

00:17:30.469 --> 00:17:32.477
To spend a trillion dollars
on something --

00:17:32.501 --> 00:17:34.276
that is not a conservative viewpoint.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.786
Then again, I don't really believe
he's a Republican.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.831
DB: And I would say, as someone
who identifies as conservative:

00:17:39.855 --> 00:17:41.018
first of all,

00:17:41.042 --> 00:17:44.080
to be conservative is to believe
in the limitations of politics.

00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:47.222
Samuel Johnson said, "Of all the things
that human hearts endure,

00:17:47.246 --> 00:17:49.693
how few are those that kings
can cause and cure."

00:17:49.717 --> 00:17:51.362
Politics is a limited realm;

00:17:51.386 --> 00:17:54.423
what matters most
is the moral nature of the society.

00:17:54.447 --> 00:17:56.616
And so I have to think
character comes first,

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.013
and a man who doesn't pass
the character threshold

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:00.377
cannot be a good president.

00:18:00.401 --> 00:18:03.066
Second, I'm the kind
of conservative who --

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.777
I harken back to Alexander Hamilton,

00:18:05.801 --> 00:18:08.131
who was a Latino hip-hop star
from the heights --

00:18:08.155 --> 00:18:12.230
(Laughter)

00:18:12.254 --> 00:18:17.625
but his definition of America
was very future-oriented.

00:18:17.649 --> 00:18:20.005
He was a poor boy from the islands

00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:24.342
who had this rapid and amazing
rise to success,

00:18:24.366 --> 00:18:27.319
and he wanted government to give
poor boys and girls like him

00:18:27.343 --> 00:18:28.497
a chance to succeed,

00:18:28.521 --> 00:18:31.742
using limited but energetic government
to create social mobility.

00:18:31.766 --> 00:18:35.350
For him and for Lincoln
and for Teddy Roosevelt,

00:18:35.374 --> 00:18:37.709
the idea of America
was the idea of the future.

00:18:37.733 --> 00:18:40.624
We may have division and racism
and slavery in our past,

00:18:40.648 --> 00:18:42.540
but we have a common future.

00:18:42.564 --> 00:18:46.762
The definition of America that Steve
Bannon stands for is backwards-looking.

00:18:46.786 --> 00:18:48.733
It's nostalgic; it's for the past.

00:18:48.757 --> 00:18:51.237
And that is not traditionally
the American identity.

00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:53.721
That's traditionally, frankly,
the Russian identity.

00:18:53.745 --> 00:18:55.227
That's how they define virtue.

00:18:55.251 --> 00:18:58.104
And so I think it is a fundamental
and foundational betrayal

00:18:58.128 --> 00:19:00.057
of what conservatism used to stand for.

00:19:00.081 --> 00:19:02.429
CA: Well, I'd like actually
like to hear from you,

00:19:02.453 --> 00:19:05.475
and if we see some comments coming in
from some of you, we'll --

00:19:05.499 --> 00:19:06.971
oh, well here's one right now.

00:19:06.995 --> 00:19:10.135
Jeffrey Alan Carnegie: I've tried
to convince progressive friends

00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:13.051
that they need to understand
what motivates Trump supporters,

00:19:13.075 --> 00:19:15.492
yet many of them have given up
trying to understand

00:19:15.516 --> 00:19:18.660
in the face of what they perceive
as lies, selfishness and hatred.

00:19:18.684 --> 00:19:21.869
How would you reach out to such people,
the Tea Party of the left,

00:19:21.893 --> 00:19:23.706
to try to bridge this divide?

00:19:24.898 --> 00:19:27.976
GC: I actually think
there are commonalities in anger,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.438
as I expressed earlier.

00:19:29.462 --> 00:19:33.892
So I think you can come to the table,
both being passionate about something.

00:19:33.916 --> 00:19:35.446
So at least you care.

00:19:36.255 --> 00:19:39.962
And I would like to believe --
the c-word has also become

00:19:39.986 --> 00:19:42.562
a horrible word -- "compromise," right?

00:19:42.586 --> 00:19:44.657
So you have the far left
and the far right,

00:19:44.681 --> 00:19:46.064
and compromise -- forget it.

00:19:46.088 --> 00:19:48.369
Those groups don't want
to even think about it.

00:19:48.393 --> 00:19:51.483
But you have a huge swath
of voters, myself included,

00:19:51.507 --> 00:19:53.235
who are registered independents,

00:19:53.259 --> 00:19:55.227
like 40 percent of us, right?

00:19:55.251 --> 00:19:59.552
So there is a huge faction of America
that wants to see change

00:19:59.576 --> 00:20:02.210
and wants to see people come together.

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:04.000
It's just that we have to figure out

00:20:04.024 --> 00:20:05.435
how to do that.

00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:07.577
CA: So let's talk about that for a minute,

00:20:07.601 --> 00:20:10.821
because we're having these TED Dialogues,
we're trying to bridge.

00:20:10.845 --> 00:20:14.521
There's a lot of people out there,
right now, perhaps especially on the left,

00:20:14.545 --> 00:20:16.336
who think this is a terrible idea,

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:22.299
that actually, the only moral response
to the great tyranny

00:20:22.323 --> 00:20:26.334
that may be about to emerge in America

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:29.990
is to resist it at every stage,
is to fight it tooth and nail,

00:20:30.014 --> 00:20:31.895
it's a mistake to try and do this.

00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:33.101
Just fight!

00:20:33.821 --> 00:20:36.166
Is there a case for that?

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.770
DB: It depends what "fight" means.
If it means literal fighting, then no.

00:20:39.794 --> 00:20:42.918
If it means marching, well maybe
marching to raise consciousness,

00:20:42.942 --> 00:20:44.207
that seems fine.

00:20:44.231 --> 00:20:48.362
But if you want change in this country,
we do it through parties and politics.

00:20:48.386 --> 00:20:53.163
We organize parties, and those parties
are big, diverse, messy coalitions,

00:20:53.187 --> 00:20:54.805
and we engage in politics,

00:20:54.829 --> 00:20:57.157
and politics is always
morally unsatisfying

00:20:57.181 --> 00:20:59.658
because it's always
a bunch of compromises.

00:20:59.682 --> 00:21:03.464
But politics is essentially
a competition between partial truths.

00:21:03.488 --> 00:21:06.123
The Trump people have a piece
of the truth in America.

00:21:06.147 --> 00:21:09.260
I think Trump himself is the wrong answer
to the right question,

00:21:09.284 --> 00:21:11.295
but they have some truth,

00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:15.468
and it's truth found in the epidemic
of opiates around the country,

00:21:15.492 --> 00:21:18.484
it's truth found in
the spread of loneliness,

00:21:18.508 --> 00:21:21.467
it's the truth found in people
whose lives are inverted.

00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:23.913
They peaked professionally at age 30,

00:21:23.937 --> 00:21:25.962
and it's all been downhill since.

00:21:25.986 --> 00:21:28.500
And so, understanding that
doesn't take fighting,

00:21:28.524 --> 00:21:30.475
it takes conversation and then asking,

00:21:30.499 --> 00:21:32.509
"What are we going to replace Trump with?"

00:21:32.533 --> 00:21:35.200
GC: But you saw fighting last night,
even at the speech,

00:21:35.224 --> 00:21:38.092
because you saw the Democratic women
who came and wore white

00:21:38.116 --> 00:21:39.824
to honor the suffragette movement.

00:21:39.848 --> 00:21:41.875
I remember back during the campaign

00:21:41.899 --> 00:21:45.388
where some Trump supporters wanted
to actually get rid of the amendment

00:21:45.412 --> 00:21:47.126
that allowed us to vote as women.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.318
It was like, what?

00:21:49.342 --> 00:21:51.668
So I don't know if
that's the right way to fight.

00:21:51.692 --> 00:21:54.500
It was interesting,
because I was looking in the audience,

00:21:54.524 --> 00:21:57.079
trying to see Democratic women
who didn't wear white.

00:21:57.103 --> 00:21:58.653
So there's a lot going on there,

00:21:58.677 --> 00:22:05.312
and there's a lot of ways to fight
that are not necessarily doing that.

00:22:05.336 --> 00:22:07.810
CA: I mean, one of the key
questions, to me, is:

00:22:07.834 --> 00:22:13.483
The people who voted for Trump
but, if you like, are more in the center,

00:22:13.507 --> 00:22:17.089
like they're possibly
amenable to persuasion --

00:22:17.113 --> 00:22:22.904
are they more likely to be persuaded
by seeing a passionate uprising

00:22:22.928 --> 00:22:26.441
of people saying, "No, no, no, you can't!"

00:22:26.465 --> 00:22:30.379
or will that actually piss them off
and push them away?

00:22:30.403 --> 00:22:32.051
DB: How are any of us persuaded?

00:22:32.075 --> 00:22:35.402
Am I going to persuade you by saying,
"Well, you're kind of a bigot,

00:22:35.426 --> 00:22:38.367
you're supporting bigotry,
you're supporting sexism.

00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:43.019
You're a primitive, fascistic rise
from some authoritarian past"?

00:22:43.043 --> 00:22:45.728
That's probably not going to be
too persuasive to you.

00:22:45.752 --> 00:22:48.393
And so the way any of us
are persuaded is by:

00:22:48.417 --> 00:22:52.759
a) some basic show of respect
for the point of view, and saying,

00:22:52.783 --> 00:22:56.102
"I think this guy is not going
to get you where you need to go."

00:22:56.126 --> 00:22:59.506
And there are two phrases
you've heard over and over again,

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.023
wherever you go in the country.

00:23:01.047 --> 00:23:02.938
One, the phrase "flyover country."

00:23:02.962 --> 00:23:04.810
And that's been heard for years,

00:23:04.834 --> 00:23:08.530
but I would say this year,
I heard it almost on an hourly basis,

00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:10.065
a sense of feeling invisible.

00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:13.847
And then the sense a sense of the phrase
"political correctness."

00:23:13.871 --> 00:23:17.950
Just that rebellion: "They're not even
letting us say what we think."

00:23:17.974 --> 00:23:19.299
And I teach at Yale.

00:23:19.323 --> 00:23:23.592
The narrowing of debate is real.

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:27.473
CA: So you would say this is a trap
that liberals have fallen into

00:23:27.497 --> 00:23:30.593
by celebrating causes
they really believe in,

00:23:30.617 --> 00:23:34.579
often expressed through the language
of "political correctness."

00:23:34.603 --> 00:23:38.938
They have done damage.
They have pushed people away.

00:23:38.962 --> 00:23:41.110
DB: I would say
a lot of the argument, though,

00:23:41.134 --> 00:23:43.495
with "descent to fascism,"
"authoritarianism" --

00:23:43.519 --> 00:23:45.708
that just feels over-the-top to people.

00:23:45.732 --> 00:23:48.515
And listen, I've written
eight million anti-Trump columns,

00:23:48.539 --> 00:23:51.209
but it is a problem, especially
for the coastal media,

00:23:51.233 --> 00:23:55.406
that every time he does something
slightly wrong, we go to 11,

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.616
and we're at 11 every day.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.480
And it just strains
credibility at some point.

00:24:00.504 --> 00:24:03.230
CA: Crying wolf a little too loud
and a little too early.

00:24:03.254 --> 00:24:06.121
But there may be a time
when we really do have to cry wolf.

00:24:06.145 --> 00:24:08.717
GC: But see -- one of the most
important things to me

00:24:08.741 --> 00:24:11.362
is how the conservative media
handles Trump.

00:24:12.259 --> 00:24:16.832
Will they call him out
when things are not true,

00:24:16.856 --> 00:24:19.039
or will they just go along with it?

00:24:19.063 --> 00:24:23.092
To me, that is what is essential
in this entire discussion,

00:24:23.116 --> 00:24:27.700
because when you have
followers of somebody

00:24:27.724 --> 00:24:31.356
who don't really care
if he tells the truth or not,

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.665
that can be very dangerous.

00:24:33.689 --> 00:24:37.975
So to me, it's: How is the conservative
media going to respond to it?

00:24:37.999 --> 00:24:40.493
I mean, you've been calling them out.

00:24:40.517 --> 00:24:44.902
But how will other forms
of conservative media deal with that

00:24:44.926 --> 00:24:46.084
as we move forward?

00:24:46.108 --> 00:24:47.504
DB: It's all shifted, though.

00:24:47.528 --> 00:24:51.166
The conservative media used to be Fox
or Charles Krauthammer or George Will.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.194
They're no longer the conservative media.

00:24:53.218 --> 00:24:56.049
Now there's another whole set
of institutions further right,

00:24:56.073 --> 00:25:01.670
which is Breitbart and Infowars,
Alex Jones, Laura Ingraham,

00:25:01.694 --> 00:25:05.495
and so they're the ones who are now
his base, not even so much Fox.

00:25:05.519 --> 00:25:09.606
CA: My last question for the time being
is just on this question of the truth.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.509
I mean, it's one of the scariest
things to people right now,

00:25:12.533 --> 00:25:16.216
that there is no agreement,
nationally, on what is true.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.030
I've never seen anything like it,

00:25:18.054 --> 00:25:21.391
where facts are so massively disputed.

00:25:21.415 --> 00:25:24.966
Your whole newspaper, sir,
is delivering fake news every day.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.498
DB: And failing.

00:25:26.522 --> 00:25:27.610
(Laughter)

00:25:27.634 --> 00:25:29.590
CA: And failing. My commiserations.

00:25:29.614 --> 00:25:35.904
But is there any path

00:25:35.928 --> 00:25:39.738
whereby we can start to get
some kind of consensus,

00:25:39.762 --> 00:25:42.622
to believe the same things?

00:25:42.646 --> 00:25:46.214
Can online communities play a role here?

00:25:46.238 --> 00:25:47.407
How do we fix this?

00:25:47.431 --> 00:25:49.469
GC: See, I understand how that happened.

00:25:49.493 --> 00:25:51.692
That's another groundswell kind of emotion

00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:53.731
that was going on in the middle of America

00:25:53.755 --> 00:25:54.988
and not being heard,

00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:58.043
in thinking that the mainstream
media was biased.

00:25:58.067 --> 00:26:02.133
There's a difference, though,
between being biased and being fake.

00:26:02.157 --> 00:26:05.730
To me, that is a very important
distinction in this conversation.

00:26:05.754 --> 00:26:10.252
So let's just say that there was some bias
in the mainstream media.

00:26:10.276 --> 00:26:13.209
OK. So there are ways
to try and mend that.

00:26:13.233 --> 00:26:17.308
But what Trump's doing
is nuclearizing that and saying,

00:26:17.332 --> 00:26:19.870
"Look, we're just going to call
all of that fake."

00:26:19.894 --> 00:26:21.440
That's where it gets dangerous.

00:26:21.464 --> 00:26:24.325
CA: Do you think enough of his supporters

00:26:24.349 --> 00:26:28.594
have a greater loyalty
to the truth than to any ...

00:26:28.618 --> 00:26:33.257
Like, the principle
of not supporting something

00:26:33.281 --> 00:26:35.279
that is demonstrably not true

00:26:35.303 --> 00:26:38.264
actually matters, so there will be
a correction at some point?

00:26:38.288 --> 00:26:40.578
DB: I think the truth
eventually comes out.

00:26:40.602 --> 00:26:43.758
So for example, Donald Trump
has based a lot of his economic policy

00:26:43.782 --> 00:26:46.786
on this supposition that Americans
have lost manufacturing jobs

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.852
because they've been stolen
by the Chinese.

00:26:48.876 --> 00:26:51.802
That is maybe 13 percent
of the jobs that left.

00:26:51.826 --> 00:26:55.408
The truth is that 87 percent of the jobs
were replaced by technology.

00:26:55.432 --> 00:26:57.210
That is just the truth.

00:26:57.234 --> 00:26:59.896
And so as a result, when he says,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.887
"I'm going to close TPP
and all the jobs will come roaring back,"

00:27:03.911 --> 00:27:05.472
they will not come roaring back.

00:27:05.496 --> 00:27:08.580
So that is an actual fact, in my belief.

00:27:08.604 --> 00:27:09.762
And --

00:27:09.786 --> 00:27:11.085
(Laughter)

00:27:11.109 --> 00:27:13.825
GC: But I'm saying what
his supporters think is the truth,

00:27:13.849 --> 00:27:15.984
no matter how many times
you might say that,

00:27:16.008 --> 00:27:17.214
they still believe him.

00:27:17.238 --> 00:27:20.997
DB: But eventually either jobs
will come back or they will not come back,

00:27:21.021 --> 00:27:24.116
and at that point, either something
will work or it doesn't work,

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.935
and it doesn't work or not work
because of great marketing,

00:27:26.959 --> 00:27:29.504
it works because it actually
addresses a real problem

00:27:29.528 --> 00:27:32.014
and so I happen to think
the truth will out.

00:27:32.038 --> 00:27:35.981
CA: If you've got a question,
please raise your hand here.

00:27:36.005 --> 00:27:38.625
Yael Eisenstat: I'll speak into the box.

00:27:38.649 --> 00:27:41.643
My name's Yael Eisenstat.

00:27:41.667 --> 00:27:43.278
I hear a lot of this talk

00:27:43.302 --> 00:27:45.981
about how we all need to start
talking to each other more

00:27:46.005 --> 00:27:47.681
and understanding each other more,

00:27:47.705 --> 00:27:51.245
and I've even written about this,
published on this subject as well,

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:56.379
but now today I keep hearing liberals --
yes, I live in New York,

00:27:56.403 --> 00:27:58.126
I can be considered a liberal --

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.849
we sit here and self-analyze:

00:27:59.873 --> 00:28:02.182
What did we do to not understand
the Rust Belt?

00:28:02.206 --> 00:28:05.056
Or: What can we do to understand
Middle America better?

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.528
And what I'd like to know:

00:28:06.552 --> 00:28:10.478
Have you seen any attempts
or conversations from Middle America

00:28:10.502 --> 00:28:13.719
of what can I do to understand
the so-called coastal elites better?

00:28:13.743 --> 00:28:17.746
Because I'm just offended
as being put in a box as a coastal elite

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.994
as someone in Middle America is
as being considered a flyover state

00:28:21.018 --> 00:28:22.495
and not listened to.

00:28:22.519 --> 00:28:25.262
CA: There you go, I can hear Facebook
cheering as you --

00:28:25.286 --> 00:28:26.386
(Laughter)

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.960
DB: I would say -- and this is someone
who has been conservative

00:28:29.984 --> 00:28:31.150
all my adult life --

00:28:31.174 --> 00:28:32.941
when you grow up conservative,

00:28:32.965 --> 00:28:34.920
you learn to speak both languages.

00:28:35.626 --> 00:28:38.030
Because if I'm going to listen to music,

00:28:38.054 --> 00:28:40.172
I'm not going to listen to Ted Nugent.

00:28:40.196 --> 00:28:44.877
So a lot of my favorite rock bands
are all on the left.

00:28:44.901 --> 00:28:46.439
If I'm going to go to a school,

00:28:46.463 --> 00:28:49.216
I'm going probably to school
where the culture is liberal.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.847
If I'm going to watch a sitcom

00:28:50.871 --> 00:28:53.434
or a late-night comedy show,
it's going to be liberal.

00:28:53.458 --> 00:28:56.641
If I'm going to read a good newspaper,
it'll be the New York Times.

00:28:56.665 --> 00:28:58.931
As a result, you learn
to speak both languages.

00:28:58.955 --> 00:29:01.839
And that actually, at least
for a number of years,

00:29:01.863 --> 00:29:04.681
when I started at National Review
with William F. Buckley,

00:29:04.705 --> 00:29:06.185
it made us sharper,

00:29:06.209 --> 00:29:09.836
because we were used to arguing
against people every day.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.169
The problem now that's happened
is you have ghettoization on the right

00:29:13.193 --> 00:29:15.554
and you can live entirely in rightworld,

00:29:15.578 --> 00:29:19.049
so as a result, the quality of argument
on the right has diminished,

00:29:19.073 --> 00:29:21.616
because you're not in the other side

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.893
all the time.

00:29:22.917 --> 00:29:27.869
But I do think if you're living
in Minnesota or Iowa or Arizona,

00:29:27.893 --> 00:29:30.228
the coastal elites
make themselves aware to you,

00:29:30.252 --> 00:29:31.938
so you know that language as well,

00:29:31.962 --> 00:29:33.390
but it's not the reverse.

00:29:33.414 --> 00:29:37.645
CA: But what does Middle America
not get about coastal elites?

00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:40.709
So the critique is,

00:29:40.733 --> 00:29:43.495
you are not dealing
with the real problems.

00:29:43.519 --> 00:29:49.980
There's a feeling of a snobbishness,
an elitism that is very off-putting.

00:29:50.004 --> 00:29:51.172
What are they missing?

00:29:51.196 --> 00:29:54.699
If you could plant one piece of truth

00:29:54.723 --> 00:29:59.913
from the mindset of someone
in this room, for example,

00:29:59.937 --> 00:30:02.665
what would you say to them?

00:30:02.689 --> 00:30:04.604
DB: Just how insanely wonderful we are.

00:30:04.628 --> 00:30:06.231
(Laughter)

00:30:06.255 --> 00:30:08.605
No, I reject the category.

00:30:08.629 --> 00:30:12.113
The problem with populism
is the same problem with elitism.

00:30:12.137 --> 00:30:14.435
It's just a prejudice on the basis

00:30:14.459 --> 00:30:17.409
of probably an over-generalized 
social class distinction

00:30:17.433 --> 00:30:20.488
which is too simplistic
to apply in reality.

00:30:20.512 --> 00:30:23.454
Those of us in New York know
there are some people in New York

00:30:23.478 --> 00:30:26.405
who are completely awesome,
and some people who are pathetic,

00:30:26.429 --> 00:30:30.163
and if you live in Iowa, some people
are awesome and some people are pathetic.

00:30:30.187 --> 00:30:32.255
It's not a question
of what degree you have

00:30:32.279 --> 00:30:34.327
or where you happen to live
in the country.

00:30:34.351 --> 00:30:37.825
The distinction is just a crude
simplification to arouse political power.

00:30:37.849 --> 00:30:42.434
GC: But I would encourage people
to watch a television news show

00:30:42.458 --> 00:30:45.127
or read a column
that they normally wouldn't.

00:30:46.041 --> 00:30:51.067
So if you are a Trump supporter,
watch the other side for a day,

00:30:51.091 --> 00:30:53.112
because you need to come out of the bubble

00:30:53.136 --> 00:30:55.238
if you're ever going
to have a conversation.

00:30:55.262 --> 00:30:57.876
And both sides -- so if you're a liberal,

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.731
then watch something
that's very conservative.

00:31:00.755 --> 00:31:04.403
Read a column that is not something
you would normally read,

00:31:04.427 --> 00:31:07.717
because then you gain perspective
of what the other side is thinking,

00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:10.201
and to me, that's a start
of coming together.

00:31:10.225 --> 00:31:13.066
I worry about the same thing
you worry about, these bubbles.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.110
I think if you only watch
certain entities,

00:31:15.134 --> 00:31:18.065
you have no idea what the rest
of the world is talking about.

00:31:18.089 --> 00:31:20.598
DB: I think not only watching,

00:31:20.622 --> 00:31:23.636
being part of an organization
that meets at least once a month

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.990
that puts you in direct contact
with people completely unlike yourself

00:31:27.014 --> 00:31:29.165
is something we all have
a responsibility for.

00:31:29.189 --> 00:31:30.656
I may get this a little wrong,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.925
but I think of the top-selling
automotive models in this country,

00:31:33.949 --> 00:31:37.271
I think the top three or four
are all pickup trucks.

00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:41.107
So ask yourself: How many people
do I know who own a pickup truck?

00:31:41.131 --> 00:31:44.560
And it could be very few or zero
for a lot of people.

00:31:44.584 --> 00:31:47.538
And that's sort of a warning sign
kind of a problem.

00:31:47.562 --> 00:31:49.311
Where can I join a club

00:31:49.335 --> 00:31:52.749
where I'll have a lot in common
with a person who drives a pickup truck

00:31:52.773 --> 00:31:54.948
because we have a common
interest in whatever?

00:31:54.972 --> 00:31:57.784
CA: And so the internet is definitely
contributing to this.

00:31:57.808 --> 00:31:59.961
A question here from Chris Ajemian:

00:31:59.985 --> 00:32:02.110
"How do you feel structure
of communications,

00:32:02.134 --> 00:32:05.864
especially the prevalence of social
media and individualized content,

00:32:05.888 --> 00:32:08.358
can be used to bring together
a political divide,

00:32:08.382 --> 00:32:11.617
instead of just filing communities
into echo chambers?"

00:32:11.641 --> 00:32:16.090
I mean, it looks like Facebook
and Google, since the election,

00:32:16.114 --> 00:32:17.793
are working hard on this question.

00:32:17.817 --> 00:32:21.635
They're trying to change the algorithms

00:32:21.659 --> 00:32:25.298
so that they don't amplify fake news

00:32:25.322 --> 00:32:27.728
to the extent that it happened
last time round.

00:32:27.752 --> 00:32:29.976
Do you see any other
promising signs of ...?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.103
GC: ... or amplify one side
of the equation.

00:32:32.127 --> 00:32:33.278
CA: Exactly.

00:32:33.302 --> 00:32:37.667
GC: I think that was the constant
argument from the right,

00:32:37.691 --> 00:32:40.261
that social media
and the internet in general

00:32:40.285 --> 00:32:44.107
was putting articles towards the top
that were not their worldview.

00:32:44.131 --> 00:32:47.073
I think, again, that fed into the anger.

00:32:47.097 --> 00:32:48.632
It fed into the anger of:

00:32:48.656 --> 00:32:51.436
"You're pushing something
that's not what I believe."

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.880
But social media has obviously
changed everything,

00:32:53.904 --> 00:32:58.281
and I think Trump is the example
of Twitter changing absolutely everything.

00:32:58.305 --> 00:33:00.308
And from his point of view,

00:33:00.332 --> 00:33:04.629
he's reaching the American people
without a filter,

00:33:04.653 --> 00:33:07.368
which he believes the media is.

00:33:09.185 --> 00:33:11.604
CA: Question from the audience.

00:33:12.318 --> 00:33:14.143
Destiny: Hi. I'm Destiny.

00:33:14.167 --> 00:33:18.497
I have a question regarding political
correctness, and I'm curious:

00:33:18.521 --> 00:33:23.191
When did political correctness
become synonymous with silencing,

00:33:23.215 --> 00:33:28.330
versus a way that we speak
about other people

00:33:28.354 --> 00:33:31.493
to show them respect
and preserve their dignity?

00:33:31.517 --> 00:33:34.905
GC: Well, I think the conservative media
really pounded this issue

00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:36.793
for the last 10 years.

00:33:36.817 --> 00:33:40.178
I think that they really, really
spent a lot of time

00:33:40.202 --> 00:33:42.008
talking about political correctness,

00:33:42.032 --> 00:33:45.435
and how people should have
the ability to say what they think.

00:33:45.459 --> 00:33:47.629
Another reason why Trump
became so popular:

00:33:47.653 --> 00:33:49.531
because he says what he thinks.

00:33:49.555 --> 00:33:54.187
It also makes me think about the fact

00:33:55.576 --> 00:33:58.611
that I do believe there are a lot
of people in America

00:33:58.635 --> 00:34:02.527
who agree with Steve Bannon,

00:34:02.551 --> 00:34:04.490
but they would never say it publicly,

00:34:04.514 --> 00:34:07.598
and so voting for Trump
gave them the opportunity

00:34:07.622 --> 00:34:09.226
to agree with it silently.

00:34:10.636 --> 00:34:15.600
DB: On the issue of immigration,
it's a legitimate point of view

00:34:15.624 --> 00:34:18.051
that we have too many immigrants
in the country,

00:34:18.075 --> 00:34:19.541
that it's economically costly.

00:34:19.565 --> 00:34:20.921
CA: That we have too many --

00:34:20.945 --> 00:34:23.554
DB: Immigrants in the country,
especially from Britain.

00:34:23.578 --> 00:34:24.752
(Laughter)

00:34:24.776 --> 00:34:27.526
GC: I kind of like the British accent, OK?

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.897
CA: I apologize. America, I am sorry.

00:34:29.921 --> 00:34:31.576
(Laughter)

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.317
I'll go now.

00:34:33.341 --> 00:34:39.265
DB: But it became
sort of impermissible to say that,

00:34:39.289 --> 00:34:42.734
because it was a sign that somehow
you must be a bigot of some sort.

00:34:42.758 --> 00:34:46.709
So the political correctness
was not only cracking down on speech

00:34:46.733 --> 00:34:48.956
that we would all find
completely offensive,

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.762
it was cracking down on some speech
that was legitimate,

00:34:51.786 --> 00:34:56.334
and then it was turning speech
and thought into action

00:34:56.358 --> 00:34:58.418
and treating it as a crime,

00:34:58.442 --> 00:35:01.362
and people getting fired
and people thrown out of schools,

00:35:01.386 --> 00:35:03.128
and there were speech codes written.

00:35:03.152 --> 00:35:04.946
Now there are these diversity teams,

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:07.650
where if you say something
that somebody finds offensive,

00:35:07.674 --> 00:35:11.370
like, "Smoking is really dangerous,"
you can say "You're insulting my group,"

00:35:11.394 --> 00:35:14.932
and the team from the administration
will come down into your dorm room

00:35:14.956 --> 00:35:17.497
and put thought police upon you.

00:35:17.521 --> 00:35:22.710
And so there has been a genuine narrowing
of what is permissible to say.

00:35:22.734 --> 00:35:24.602
And some of it is legitimate.

00:35:24.626 --> 00:35:29.989
There are certain words that there
should be some social sanction against,

00:35:30.013 --> 00:35:32.987
but some of it was used
to enforce a political agenda.

00:35:33.011 --> 00:35:34.224
CA: So is that a project

00:35:34.248 --> 00:35:37.228
you would urge on liberals,
if you like -- progressives --

00:35:37.252 --> 00:35:42.169
to rethink the ground rules
around political correctness

00:35:42.193 --> 00:35:47.888
and accept a little more
uncomfortable language

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:50.746
in certain circumstances?

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.504
Can you see that being solved

00:35:52.528 --> 00:35:56.731
to an extent that others
won't be so offended?

00:35:56.755 --> 00:36:00.079
DB: I mean, most American universities,
especially elite universities,

00:36:00.103 --> 00:36:01.636
are overwhelmingly on the left,

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.522
and there's just an ease of temptation

00:36:03.546 --> 00:36:07.739
to use your overwhelming cultural power
to try to enforce some sort of thought

00:36:07.763 --> 00:36:10.052
that you think is right
and correct thought.

00:36:10.076 --> 00:36:13.279
So, be a little more self-suspicious
of, are we doing that?

00:36:13.303 --> 00:36:16.779
And second, my university,
the University of Chicago,

00:36:16.803 --> 00:36:19.533
sent out this letter saying,
we will have no safe spaces.

00:36:19.557 --> 00:36:21.967
There will be no critique
of micro-aggression.

00:36:21.991 --> 00:36:25.452
If you get your feelings hurt,
well, welcome to the world of education.

00:36:25.476 --> 00:36:26.890
I do think that policy --

00:36:26.914 --> 00:36:30.248
which is being embraced by a lot
of people on the left, by the way --

00:36:30.272 --> 00:36:32.438
is just a corrective to what's happened.

00:36:32.462 --> 00:36:34.571
CA: So here's a question
from Karen Holloway:

00:36:34.595 --> 00:36:36.925
How do we foster an American culture

00:36:36.949 --> 00:36:39.473
that's forward-looking, like Hamilton,

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:42.025
that expects and deals with change,

00:36:42.049 --> 00:36:45.733
rather than wanting to have everything
go back to some fictional past?

00:36:46.924 --> 00:36:48.502
That's an easy question, right?

00:36:48.526 --> 00:36:51.117
GC: Well, I'm still a believer
in the American dream,

00:36:51.141 --> 00:36:54.575
and I think what we can teach
our children is the basics,

00:36:54.599 --> 00:36:57.996
which is that hard work

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.530
and believing in yourself

00:37:01.417 --> 00:37:03.637
in America, you can achieve
whatever you want.

00:37:03.661 --> 00:37:05.322
I was told that every single day.

00:37:05.346 --> 00:37:09.377
When I got in the real world, I was like,
wow, that's maybe not always so true.

00:37:09.401 --> 00:37:11.072
But I still believe in that.

00:37:11.096 --> 00:37:12.669
Maybe I'm being too optimistic.

00:37:12.693 --> 00:37:16.404
So I still look towards the future
for that to continue.

00:37:16.928 --> 00:37:19.090
DB: I think you're being too optimistic.

00:37:19.114 --> 00:37:20.272
GC: You do?

00:37:20.296 --> 00:37:24.328
DB: The odds of an American young person
exceeding their parents' salary --

00:37:24.352 --> 00:37:26.889
a generation ago, like 86 percent did it.

00:37:26.913 --> 00:37:28.672
Now 51 percent do it.

00:37:28.696 --> 00:37:31.964
There's just been a problem
in social mobility in the country.

00:37:31.988 --> 00:37:36.817
CA: You've written that this entire
century has basically been a disaster,

00:37:36.841 --> 00:37:42.474
that the age of sunny growth is over
and we're in deep trouble.

00:37:42.498 --> 00:37:46.957
DB: Yeah, I mean, we averaged,
in real terms, population-adjusted,

00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:49.101
two or three percent growth for 50 years,

00:37:49.125 --> 00:37:51.669
and now we've had less
than one percent growth.

00:37:51.693 --> 00:37:54.192
And so there's something seeping out.

00:37:54.216 --> 00:37:58.789
And so if I'm going to tell people
that they should take risks,

00:37:58.813 --> 00:38:01.860
one of the things we're seeing
is a rapid decline in mobility,

00:38:01.884 --> 00:38:05.253
the number of people who are moving
across state lines,

00:38:05.277 --> 00:38:08.292
and that's especially true
among millennials.

00:38:08.316 --> 00:38:10.206
It's young people that are moving less.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:14.131
So how do we give people the security
from which they can take risk?

00:38:14.155 --> 00:38:17.737
And I'm a big believer in attachment
theory of raising children,

00:38:17.761 --> 00:38:20.345
and attachment theory
is based on the motto

00:38:20.369 --> 00:38:24.791
that all of life is a series
of daring adventures from a secure base.

00:38:25.399 --> 00:38:27.772
Have you parents given you a secure base?

00:38:27.796 --> 00:38:30.169
And as a society,
we do not have a secure base,

00:38:30.193 --> 00:38:34.581
and we won't get to that "Hamilton,"
risk-taking, energetic ethos

00:38:34.605 --> 00:38:37.062
until we can supply a secure base.

00:38:37.086 --> 00:38:40.485
CA: So I wonder whether
there's ground here

00:38:40.509 --> 00:38:45.266
to create almost like a shared agenda,
a bridging conversation,

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:50.636
on the one hand recognizing
that there is this really deep problem

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.165
that the system,
the economic system that we built,

00:38:53.189 --> 00:38:56.109
seems to be misfiring right now.

00:38:57.064 --> 00:39:02.434
Second, that maybe, if you're right
that it's not all about immigrants,

00:39:02.458 --> 00:39:04.416
it's probably more about technology,

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.464
if you could win that argument,

00:39:06.488 --> 00:39:11.657
that de-emphasizes what seems to me
the single most divisive territory

00:39:11.681 --> 00:39:15.735
between Trump supporters and others,
which is around the role of the other.

00:39:15.759 --> 00:39:19.809
It's very offensive to people on the left
to have the other demonized

00:39:19.833 --> 00:39:22.538
to the extent that the other
seems to be demonized.

00:39:22.562 --> 00:39:25.140
That feels deeply immoral,

00:39:25.164 --> 00:39:28.034
and maybe people on the left
could agree, as you said,

00:39:28.058 --> 00:39:30.919
that immigration
may have happened too fast,

00:39:30.943 --> 00:39:35.520
and there is a limit beyond which
human societies struggle,

00:39:35.544 --> 00:39:39.633
but nonetheless this whole problem
becomes de-emphasized

00:39:39.657 --> 00:39:41.792
if automation is the key issue,

00:39:41.816 --> 00:39:44.770
and then we try to work together
on recognizing that it's real,

00:39:44.794 --> 00:39:47.923
recognizing that the problem
probably wasn't properly addressed

00:39:47.947 --> 00:39:49.293
or seen or heard,

00:39:49.317 --> 00:39:52.626
and try to figure out
how to rebuild communities

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.658
using, well, using what?

00:39:54.682 --> 00:39:58.718
That seems to me to become
the fertile conversation of the future:

00:39:58.742 --> 00:40:01.862
How do we rebuild communities
in this modern age,

00:40:01.886 --> 00:40:04.218
with technology doing what it's doing,

00:40:04.242 --> 00:40:06.437
and reimagine this bright future?

00:40:06.461 --> 00:40:08.564
GC: That's why I go back to optimism.

00:40:08.588 --> 00:40:12.463
I'm not being ... it's not like
I'm not looking at the facts,

00:40:12.487 --> 00:40:14.925
where we've come or where we've come from.

00:40:14.949 --> 00:40:18.936
But for gosh sakes, if we don't look
at it from an optimistic point of view --

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.664
I'm refusing to do that just yet.

00:40:20.688 --> 00:40:24.902
I'm not raising my 12- and 13-year-old
to say, "Look, the world is dim."

00:40:24.926 --> 00:40:27.922
CA; We're going to have
one more question from the room here.

00:40:27.946 --> 00:40:31.612
Questioner: Hi. Hello. Sorry.

00:40:31.636 --> 00:40:35.140
You both mentioned
the infrastructure plan and Russia

00:40:35.164 --> 00:40:40.529
and some other things that wouldn't be
traditional Republican priorities.

00:40:40.553 --> 00:40:47.122
What do you think, or when,
will Republicans be motivated

00:40:47.146 --> 00:40:51.131
to take a stand against Trumpism?

00:40:51.559 --> 00:40:54.482
GC: After last night, not for a while.

00:40:54.506 --> 00:40:56.856
He changed a lot last night, I believe.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.531
DB: His popularity among Republicans --
he's got 85 percent approval,

00:41:00.555 --> 00:41:02.775
which is higher than Reagan
had at this time,

00:41:02.799 --> 00:41:05.715
and that's because society
has just gotten more polarized.

00:41:05.739 --> 00:41:08.388
So people follow the party
much more than they used to.

00:41:08.412 --> 00:41:11.568
So if you're waiting for Paul Ryan
and the Republicans in Congress

00:41:11.592 --> 00:41:12.751
to flake away,

00:41:12.775 --> 00:41:14.424
it's going to take a little while.

00:41:14.448 --> 00:41:17.930
GC: But also because they're all
concerned about reelection,

00:41:17.954 --> 00:41:21.649
and Trump has so much power
with getting people either for you

00:41:21.673 --> 00:41:23.114
or against you,

00:41:23.138 --> 00:41:25.476
and so, they're vacillating
every day, probably:

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.616
"Well, should I go against
or should I not?"

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:31.139
But last night, where he finally
sounded presidential,

00:41:31.163 --> 00:41:34.895
I think most Republicans are breathing
a sigh of relief today.

00:41:34.919 --> 00:41:37.209
DB: The half-life of that is short.

00:41:37.233 --> 00:41:40.488
GC: Right -- I was just going to say,
until Twitter happens again.

00:41:40.512 --> 00:41:43.580
CA: OK, I want to give
each of you the chance

00:41:43.604 --> 00:41:47.431
to imagine you're speaking
to -- I don't know --

00:41:47.455 --> 00:41:49.406
the people online who are watching this,

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:50.976
who may be Trump supporters,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.052
who may be on the left,
somewhere in the middle.

00:41:54.649 --> 00:42:01.444
How would you advise them to bridge
or to relate to other people?

00:42:01.468 --> 00:42:05.617
Can you share any final wisdom on this?

00:42:05.641 --> 00:42:09.415
Or if you think that they shouldn't,
tell them that as well.

00:42:09.439 --> 00:42:11.075
GC: I would just start by saying

00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:15.410
that I really think any change
and coming together starts from the top,

00:42:15.434 --> 00:42:17.372
just like any other organization.

00:42:18.534 --> 00:42:21.412
And I would love if, somehow,

00:42:21.436 --> 00:42:25.999
Trump supporters or people on the left
could encourage their leaders

00:42:26.023 --> 00:42:28.575
to show that compassion from the top,

00:42:28.599 --> 00:42:32.273
because imagine the change
that we could have

00:42:32.297 --> 00:42:34.425
if Donald Trump tweeted out today,

00:42:34.449 --> 00:42:36.110
to all of his supporters,

00:42:36.134 --> 00:42:38.794
"Let's not be vile anymore to each other.

00:42:38.818 --> 00:42:40.492
Let's have more understanding.

00:42:40.516 --> 00:42:43.346
As a leader, I'm going
to be more inclusive

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:45.305
to all of the people of America."

00:42:46.212 --> 00:42:48.305
To me, it starts at the top.

00:42:48.329 --> 00:42:51.706
Is he going to do that? I have no idea.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:54.430
But I think that everything
starts from the top,

00:42:54.454 --> 00:42:56.183
and the power that he has

00:42:56.207 --> 00:42:59.196
in encouraging his supporters

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:03.033
to have an understanding of where
people are coming from on the other side.

00:43:04.317 --> 00:43:06.816
CA: David. DB: Yeah, I guess I would say

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.582
I don't think we can teach
each other to be civil,

00:43:09.606 --> 00:43:11.349
and give us sermons on civility.

00:43:11.373 --> 00:43:12.617
That's not going to do it.

00:43:12.641 --> 00:43:14.325
It's substance and how we act,

00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:17.968
and the nice thing about Donald Trump
is he smashed our categories.

00:43:17.992 --> 00:43:22.114
All the categories that we thought
we were thinking in, they're obsolete.

00:43:22.138 --> 00:43:25.220
They were great for the 20th century.
They're not good for today.

00:43:25.244 --> 00:43:28.475
He's got an agenda which is about
closing borders and closing trade.

00:43:28.499 --> 00:43:30.324
I just don't think it's going to work.

00:43:30.348 --> 00:43:33.169
I think if we want to rebuild
communities, recreate jobs,

00:43:33.193 --> 00:43:34.847
we need a different set of agenda

00:43:34.871 --> 00:43:38.442
that smashes through all our current
divisions and our current categories.

00:43:38.466 --> 00:43:41.982
For me, that agenda is Reaganism
on macroeconomic policy,

00:43:42.006 --> 00:43:44.176
Sweden on welfare policy

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.402
and cuts across right and left.

00:43:46.426 --> 00:43:49.363
I think we have to have a dynamic
economy that creates growth.

00:43:49.387 --> 00:43:51.220
That's the Reagan on economic policy.

00:43:51.244 --> 00:43:53.209
But people have to have that secure base.

00:43:53.233 --> 00:43:55.284
There have to be
nurse-family partnerships;

00:43:55.308 --> 00:43:57.086
there has to be universal preschool;

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:59.105
there have to be charter schools;

00:43:59.129 --> 00:44:02.097
there have to be college programs
with wraparound programs

00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:03.602
for parents and communities.

00:44:03.626 --> 00:44:08.622
We need to help heal the crisis
of social solidarity in this country

00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:10.142
and help heal families,

00:44:10.166 --> 00:44:12.500
and government just has to get
a lot more involved

00:44:12.524 --> 00:44:16.187
in the way liberals like
to rebuild communities.

00:44:16.211 --> 00:44:19.433
At the other hand, we have to have
an economy that's free and open

00:44:19.457 --> 00:44:21.383
the way conservatives used to like.

00:44:21.407 --> 00:44:24.465
And so getting the substance right
is how you smash through

00:44:24.489 --> 00:44:25.881
the partisan identities,

00:44:25.905 --> 00:44:29.208
because the substance is what
ultimately shapes our polarization.

00:44:30.572 --> 00:44:32.541
CA: David and Gretchen, thank you so much

00:44:32.565 --> 00:44:34.700
for an absolutely
fascinating conversation.

00:44:34.724 --> 00:44:37.861
Thank you. That was really,
really interesting.

00:44:37.885 --> 00:44:41.208
(Applause)

00:44:41.232 --> 00:44:45.500
Hey, let's keep the conversation going.

00:44:45.524 --> 00:44:47.641
We're continuing to try and figure out

00:44:47.665 --> 00:44:49.301
whether we can add something here,

00:44:49.325 --> 00:44:51.366
so keep the conversation
going on Facebook.

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:55.080
Give us your thoughts from whatever part
of the political spectrum you're on,

00:44:55.104 --> 00:44:57.165
and actually, wherever
in the world you are.

00:44:57.189 --> 00:44:59.947
This is not just about America.
It's about the world, too.

00:45:01.296 --> 00:45:03.630
But we're not going
to end today without music,

00:45:03.654 --> 00:45:08.446
because if we put music
in every political conversation,

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:10.908
the world would be
completely different, frankly.

00:45:10.932 --> 00:45:12.710
It just would.

00:45:12.734 --> 00:45:15.341
(Applause)

00:45:15.365 --> 00:45:17.455
Up in Harlem, this extraordinary woman,

00:45:17.479 --> 00:45:19.904
Vy Higginsen, who's actually right here --

00:45:19.928 --> 00:45:21.169
let's get a shot of her.

00:45:21.193 --> 00:45:24.562
(Applause)

00:45:24.586 --> 00:45:28.869
She created this program
that brings teens together,

00:45:28.893 --> 00:45:32.337
teaches them the joy
and the impact of gospel music,

00:45:32.361 --> 00:45:36.340
and hundreds of teens have gone
through this program.

00:45:36.364 --> 00:45:37.883
It's transformative for them.

00:45:37.907 --> 00:45:40.095
The music they made, as you already heard,

00:45:40.119 --> 00:45:41.425
is extraordinary,

00:45:41.449 --> 00:45:45.823
and I can't think of a better way
of ending this TED Dialogue

00:45:45.847 --> 00:45:49.654
than welcoming Vy Higginsen's
Gospel Choir from Harlem.

00:45:49.678 --> 00:45:50.855
Thank you.

00:45:50.879 --> 00:45:54.037
(Applause)

00:46:10.708 --> 00:46:15.342
(Singing) Choir: O beautiful
for spacious skies

00:46:15.366 --> 00:46:20.298
For amber waves of grain

00:46:20.322 --> 00:46:25.046
For purple mountain majesties

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:29.776
Above the fruited plain

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.971
America!

00:46:34.469 --> 00:46:37.093
America!

00:46:39.002 --> 00:46:41.208
America!

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:45.626
America!

00:46:48.138 --> 00:46:52.790
God shed his grace on thee

00:46:52.814 --> 00:46:57.229
And crown thy good with brotherhood

00:46:57.253 --> 00:47:04.240
From sea to shining sea

00:47:11.468 --> 00:47:18.465
From sea to shining sea

00:47:25.237 --> 00:47:32.067
(Applause)
