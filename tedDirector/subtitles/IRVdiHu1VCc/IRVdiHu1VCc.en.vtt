00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:19.224
The "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:22.018
to a little town
in Colorado, called Craig.

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:23.859
It's only a couple dozen square miles.

00:00:23.883 --> 00:00:25.121
It's in the Rockies.

00:00:25.145 --> 00:00:27.689
And the job in question was sheep rancher.

00:00:27.713 --> 00:00:31.496
My role on the show, for those of you
who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.706
I'm an apprentice,

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.454
and I work with the people
who do the jobs in question.

00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:38.454
And my responsibilities
are to simply try and keep up,

00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:41.676
and give an honest account
of what it's like to be these people

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.136
for one day in their life.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.734
The job in question: herding sheep.

00:00:45.758 --> 00:00:46.911
Great.

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:50.246
We go to Craig and we check into a hotel,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.386
and I realize the next day

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.411
that castration is going to be
an absolute part of this work.

00:00:56.524 --> 00:00:59.136
Normally, I never do any research at all.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.647
But this is a touchy subject,
and I work for the Discovery Channel,

00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:07.278
and we want to portray accurately
whatever it is we do.

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:12.136
And we certainly want to do it
with a lot of respect for the animals.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.224
So I call the Humane Society and I say,

00:01:14.248 --> 00:01:17.662
"Look, I'm going to be castrating
some lambs. Can you tell me the deal?"

00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:20.223
And they're like, "Yeah,
it's pretty straightforward."

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:26.288
They use a band, basically, a rubber band,
like this, only a little smaller.

00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:28.509
This one was actually
around the playing cards

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.716
I got yesterday --

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.262
(Laughter)

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:33.177
But it had a certain familiarity to it.

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:36.383
And I said, "Well, what exactly
is the process?"

00:01:36.407 --> 00:01:39.252
And they said, "The band
is applied to the tail, tightly.

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:42.640
And then another band is applied
to the scrotum, tightly.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.136
Blood flow is slowly retarded;

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.256
a week later the parts
in question fall off.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.432
"Great -- got it."

00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:51.039
OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this.

00:01:51.063 --> 00:01:52.230
They confirm it.

00:01:52.254 --> 00:01:53.720
I also call PETA just for fun,

00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:55.890
and they don't like it,
but they confirm it.

00:01:55.914 --> 00:01:57.601
OK, that's basically how you do it.

00:01:57.625 --> 00:01:59.013
So the next day I go out.

00:01:59.037 --> 00:02:01.382
And I'm given a horse
and we go get the lambs

00:02:01.406 --> 00:02:03.442
and we take them to a pen that we built,

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:07.136
and we go about the business
of animal husbandry.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.605
Melanie is the wife of Albert.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.326
Albert is the shepherd in question.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.433
Melanie picks up the lamb,
one hand on both legs on the right,

00:02:14.457 --> 00:02:15.870
likewise on the left.

00:02:15.894 --> 00:02:18.073
Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up.

00:02:18.097 --> 00:02:19.271
Alright. Great.

00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:21.942
Albert goes in, I follow Albert,
the crew is around.

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:25.441
I always watch the process done
the first time before I try it.

00:02:25.465 --> 00:02:27.752
Being an apprentice,
you know, you do that.

00:02:27.776 --> 00:02:31.354
Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out,
you know, this black rubber band,

00:02:31.378 --> 00:02:33.378
but what comes out instead is a knife.

00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:37.213
And I'm like, "Hmm, that's not
rubber at all," you know?

00:02:37.237 --> 00:02:38.426
(Laughter)

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.244
And he kind of flicked it open
in a way that caught the sun

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:43.806
that was just coming
over the Rockies, it was very --

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.346
(Laughter)

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.557
It was ... it was impressive.

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:49.966
In the space of about two seconds,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.771
Albert had the knife
between the cartilage of the tail,

00:02:53.795 --> 00:02:56.442
right next to the butt of the lamb,

00:02:56.466 --> 00:03:00.002
and very quickly, the tail was gone
and in the bucket that I was holding.

00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:03.595
A second later, with a big thumb
and a well-calloused forefinger,

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.522
he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.

00:03:06.546 --> 00:03:08.371
And he pulled it toward him, like so,

00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:10.609
and he took the knife
and he put it on the tip.

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:13.243
"Now, you think you know
what's coming, Michael,

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:14.529
You don't, OK?"

00:03:14.553 --> 00:03:15.573
(Laughter)

00:03:15.597 --> 00:03:18.482
He snips it, throws the tip
over his shoulder,

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:20.822
and then grabs the scrotum
and pushes it upward,

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:24.745
and then his head dips down,
obscuring my view.

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.976
But what I hear is a slurping sound,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.913
and a noise that sounds like Velcro
being yanked off a sticky wall,

00:03:30.937 --> 00:03:32.340
and I am not even kidding.

00:03:33.884 --> 00:03:35.037
Can we roll the video?

00:03:35.061 --> 00:03:36.403
No, I'm kidding, we don't --

00:03:36.427 --> 00:03:38.423
(Laughter)

00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:40.687
I thought it best to talk in pictures.

00:03:41.426 --> 00:03:45.431
I do something now I've never, ever done
on a "Dirty Jobs" shoot, ever.

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:47.136
I say, "Time out. Stop."

00:03:47.777 --> 00:03:50.705
You guys know the show, we use take one;
we don't do take two.

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.647
There's no writing, there's no scripting,
there's no nonsense.

00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:55.824
We don't fool around, we don't rehearse --

00:03:55.848 --> 00:03:57.246
we shoot what we get!

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.391
I said, "Stop. This is nuts."

00:03:59.415 --> 00:04:00.569
I mean --

00:04:00.593 --> 00:04:01.878
(Laughter)

00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:03.082
"This is crazy.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.379
We can't do this."

00:04:05.403 --> 00:04:06.651
And Albert's like, "What?"

00:04:06.675 --> 00:04:08.872
And I'm like, "I don't know
what just happened,

00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:10.828
but there are testicles in this bucket,

00:04:10.852 --> 00:04:12.268
and that's not how we do it."

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:14.050
He said "Well, that's how we do it."

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:16.017
I said, "Why would you do it this way?"

00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:17.708
And before I even let him explain,

00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:20.713
I said, "I want to do it the right way,
with the rubber bands."

00:04:20.737 --> 00:04:22.631
And he says, "Like the Humane Society?"

00:04:22.655 --> 00:04:24.493
I said, "Yes, like the Humane Society.

00:04:24.517 --> 00:04:28.102
Let's do something that doesn't make
the lamb squeal and bleed.

00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:29.752
We're on in five continents, dude!

00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:32.560
We're on twice a day
on the Discovery -- we can't do this."

00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:33.763
He says, "OK."

00:04:33.787 --> 00:04:37.040
He goes to his box and pulls out
a bag of these little rubber bands.

00:04:37.064 --> 00:04:39.572
Melanie picks up another lamb,
puts it on the post,

00:04:39.596 --> 00:04:42.314
band goes on the tail,
band goes on the scrotum.

00:04:42.338 --> 00:04:46.110
Lamb goes on the ground,
lamb takes two steps, falls down,

00:04:46.134 --> 00:04:48.609
gets up, shakes a little,

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:50.624
takes another couple steps, falls down.

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:54.983
I'm like, this is not a good sign
for this lamb, at all.

00:04:55.007 --> 00:04:56.680
Gets up, walks to the corner.

00:04:56.704 --> 00:05:00.293
It's quivering, and it lies
down and it's in obvious distress.

00:05:00.317 --> 00:05:04.136
And I'm looking at the lamb
and I say, "Albert, how long?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.472
When does he get up?"

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:07.197
He's like, "A day?"

00:05:07.747 --> 00:05:10.385
I said, "A day! How long does
it take them to fall off?"

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:11.584
"A week."

00:05:11.608 --> 00:05:16.966
Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just done
his little procedure on

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.060
is, you know, he's just prancing
around, bleeding stopped.

00:05:21.084 --> 00:05:23.832
He's, you know, nibbling
on some grass, frolicking.

00:05:24.372 --> 00:05:29.362
And I was just so blown away
at how completely wrong I was,

00:05:29.386 --> 00:05:31.001
in that second.

00:05:31.025 --> 00:05:35.120
And I was reminded how utterly wrong
I am, so much of the time.

00:05:35.144 --> 00:05:36.240
(Laughter)

00:05:36.264 --> 00:05:38.056
And I was especially reminded

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.352
of what a ridiculously
short straw I had that day,

00:05:41.376 --> 00:05:43.843
because now I had to do
what Albert had just done,

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:46.522
and there are like 100
of these lambs in the pen.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:50.713
And suddenly, this whole thing's starting
to feel like a German porno,

00:05:50.737 --> 00:05:52.052
and I'm like --

00:05:52.076 --> 00:05:54.629
(Laughter)

00:05:54.653 --> 00:05:58.210
Melanie picks up the lamb,
puts it on the post, opens it up.

00:05:58.234 --> 00:05:59.501
Albert hands me the knife.

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.224
I go in, tail comes off.

00:06:01.248 --> 00:06:04.354
I go in, I grab the scrotum,
tip comes off.

00:06:04.378 --> 00:06:06.724
Albert instructs, "Push it way up there."

00:06:06.748 --> 00:06:07.899
I do.

00:06:07.923 --> 00:06:09.074
"Push it further."

00:06:09.098 --> 00:06:10.249
I do.

00:06:10.273 --> 00:06:13.548
The testicles emerge. They look
like thumbs, coming right at you.

00:06:13.572 --> 00:06:15.191
And he says, "Bite 'em.

00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:17.195
Just bite 'em off."

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:18.345
(Laughter)

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:20.458
And I heard him, I heard all the words --

00:06:20.482 --> 00:06:25.070
(Laughter)

00:06:25.094 --> 00:06:26.713
Like, how did I get here?

00:06:26.737 --> 00:06:28.619
How did -- I mean --

00:06:28.643 --> 00:06:29.975
how did I get here?

00:06:30.643 --> 00:06:35.988
It's just -- it's one of those moments
where the brain goes off on its own,

00:06:36.012 --> 00:06:39.136
and suddenly, I'm standing
there in the Rockies,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.546
and all I can think of is the Aristotelian
definition of a tragedy.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.671
You know, Aristotle says
a tragedy is that moment

00:06:47.695 --> 00:06:51.251
when the hero comes face to face
with his true identity.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:52.620
(Laughter)

00:06:52.644 --> 00:06:54.926
And I'm like, "What is this
jacked-up metaphor?

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.998
I don't like what I'm thinking right now."

00:06:57.022 --> 00:06:59.115
And I can't get this thought
out of my head,

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:01.247
and I can't get that vision
out of my sight,

00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:03.600
so I did what I had to do.

00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:05.625
I went in and I took them.

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:07.010
I took them like this,

00:07:07.034 --> 00:07:08.807
and I yanked my head back.

00:07:09.852 --> 00:07:13.649
And I'm standing there
with two testicles on my chin.

00:07:13.673 --> 00:07:15.594
(Laughter)

00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:18.770
And now I can't get --
I can't shake the metaphor.

00:07:18.794 --> 00:07:22.436
I'm still in "Poetics," in Aristotle,
and I'm thinking --

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.935
out of nowhere, two terms come crashing
into my head, that I hadn't heard

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:29.075
since my classics professor in college
drilled them there.

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:31.768
And they are "anagnorisis"
and "peripeteia."

00:07:31.792 --> 00:07:34.119
Anagnorisis and peripeteia.

00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:38.050
Anagnorisis is the Greek
word for discovery.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.506
Literally, the transition from ignorance
to knowledge is anagnorisis.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.872
It's what our network does;
it's what "Dirty Jobs" is.

00:07:47.896 --> 00:07:51.934
And I'm up to my neck
in anagnorises every single day.

00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.113
Great.

00:07:53.137 --> 00:07:55.275
The other word, peripeteia,

00:07:55.299 --> 00:08:00.613
that's the moment
in the great tragedies --

00:08:00.637 --> 00:08:02.875
Euripides and Sophocles.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:08.404
That's the moment where Oedipus has
his moment, where he suddenly realizes

00:08:08.428 --> 00:08:11.323
that hot chick he's been sleeping with
and having babies with

00:08:11.347 --> 00:08:12.746
is his mother.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.765
That's peripety, or peripeteia.

00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:17.948
And this metaphor in my head --

00:08:17.972 --> 00:08:20.713
I've got anagnorisis
and peripeteia on my chin --

00:08:20.737 --> 00:08:23.002
(Laughter)

00:08:23.026 --> 00:08:25.630
I've got to tell you,
it's such a great device, though.

00:08:25.654 --> 00:08:28.227
When you start to look for peripeteia,

00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:29.788
you find it everywhere.

00:08:29.812 --> 00:08:32.725
I mean, Bruce Willis
in "The Sixth Sense," right?

00:08:32.749 --> 00:08:36.305
Spends the whole movie trying to help
the little kid who sees dead people,

00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:38.054
and then -- boom! -- "Oh, I'm dead."

00:08:38.078 --> 00:08:39.238
Peripeteia. You know?

00:08:39.262 --> 00:08:42.732
It's crushing when the audience
sees it the right way.

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:45.257
Neo in "The Matrix," you know?

00:08:45.281 --> 00:08:47.256
"Oh, I'm living in a computer program.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.843
That's weird."

00:08:48.867 --> 00:08:51.800
These discoveries
that lead to sudden realizations.

00:08:52.443 --> 00:08:55.120
And I've been having them,
over 200 dirty jobs,

00:08:55.144 --> 00:08:57.276
I have them all the time, but that one --

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.772
that one drilled something home
in a way that I just wasn't prepared for.

00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:03.753
And, as I stood there,

00:09:04.236 --> 00:09:09.843
looking at the happy lamb
that I had just defiled --

00:09:09.867 --> 00:09:11.656
but it looked OK;

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.957
looking at that poor other little thing
that I'd done it the right way on,

00:09:15.981 --> 00:09:17.635
and I just was struck by --

00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:21.889
if I'm wrong about that,

00:09:21.913 --> 00:09:24.280
and if I'm wrong so often,
in a literal way,

00:09:24.304 --> 00:09:29.591
what other peripatetic misconceptions
might I be able to comment upon?

00:09:29.615 --> 00:09:32.092
Because, look --
I'm not a social anthropologist,

00:09:32.116 --> 00:09:33.432
but I have a friend who is.

00:09:33.456 --> 00:09:35.136
And I talk to him.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.687
(Laughter)

00:09:36.711 --> 00:09:38.213
And he says, "Hey Mike, look.

00:09:38.237 --> 00:09:42.221
I don't know if your brain is interested
in this sort of thing or not,

00:09:42.245 --> 00:09:44.515
but do you realize
you've shot in every state?

00:09:44.539 --> 00:09:47.811
You've worked in mining,
you've worked in fishing,

00:09:47.835 --> 00:09:51.503
you've worked in steel,
you've worked in every major industry.

00:09:51.527 --> 00:09:54.582
You've had your back
shoulder to shoulder with these guys

00:09:54.606 --> 00:09:58.212
that our politicians are desperate
to relate to every four years, right?"

00:09:58.236 --> 00:10:00.852
I can still see Hillary
doing the shots of rye,

00:10:00.876 --> 00:10:03.176
dribbling down her chin,
with the steel workers.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.399
I mean, these are the people
that I work with every single day.

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:10.807
"And if you have something to say
about their thoughts, collectively,

00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:12.745
it might be time to think about it.

00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:16.336
Because, dude, you know, four years."

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.587
So, that's in my head,
testicles are on my chin,

00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:22.496
thoughts are bouncing around.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.889
And, after that shoot,
"Dirty Jobs" really didn't change,

00:10:27.913 --> 00:10:31.367
in terms of what the show is,
but it changed for me, personally.

00:10:31.391 --> 00:10:33.270
And now, when I talk about the show,

00:10:33.294 --> 00:10:38.619
I no longer just tell the story
you heard and 190 like it.

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:42.875
I do, but I also start to talk
about some of the other things

00:10:42.899 --> 00:10:44.074
I got wrong;

00:10:44.098 --> 00:10:46.124
some of the other notions of work

00:10:46.148 --> 00:10:49.334
that I've just been assuming
are sacrosanct,

00:10:50.054 --> 00:10:51.205
and they're not.

00:10:51.229 --> 00:10:54.136
People with dirty jobs
are happier than you think.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.171
As a group, they're
the happiest people I know.

00:10:57.195 --> 00:11:00.177
And I don't want to start whistling
"Look for the Union Label,"

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:01.685
and all that happy-worker crap.

00:11:01.709 --> 00:11:04.106
I'm just telling you
that these are balanced people

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.285
who do unthinkable work.

00:11:05.309 --> 00:11:08.410
Roadkill picker-uppers whistle
while they work, I swear to God --

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:09.588
I did it with them.

00:11:09.612 --> 00:11:13.817
They've got this amazing
sort of symmetry to their life.

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:16.470
And I see it over and over and over again.

00:11:16.494 --> 00:11:18.584
So I started to wonder what would happen

00:11:18.608 --> 00:11:21.355
if we challenged
some of these sacred cows?

00:11:21.675 --> 00:11:23.363
Follow your passion --

00:11:23.387 --> 00:11:26.393
we've been talking about it
here for the last 36 hours.

00:11:27.035 --> 00:11:29.977
Follow your passion -- what could
possibly be wrong with that?

00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:32.004
It's probably the worst advice I ever got.

00:11:32.028 --> 00:11:33.102
(Laughter)

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:35.004
Follow your dreams and go broke, right?

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.850
I mean, that's all I heard growing up.

00:11:36.874 --> 00:11:38.700
I didn't know what to do with my life,

00:11:38.724 --> 00:11:41.865
but I was told if you follow your passion,
it's going to work out.

00:11:41.889 --> 00:11:43.690
I can give you 30 examples right now.

00:11:43.714 --> 00:11:45.787
Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas

00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:48.469
who collects the uneaten scraps
of food from the casinos

00:11:48.493 --> 00:11:50.180
and feeds them to his swine.

00:11:50.204 --> 00:11:51.355
Why?

00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:54.153
Because there's so much protein
in the stuff we don't eat,

00:11:54.177 --> 00:11:57.494
his pigs grow at twice the normal speed,
and he's one rich pig farmer.

00:11:57.518 --> 00:11:58.955
He's good for the environment,

00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:01.283
he spends his days
doing this incredible service,

00:12:01.307 --> 00:12:03.315
and he smells like hell,
but God bless him.

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:04.637
He's making a great living.

00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:06.930
You ask him, "Did you follow
your passion here?"

00:12:06.954 --> 00:12:08.109
and he'd laugh at you.

00:12:08.133 --> 00:12:12.378
The guy's worth -- he just got offered
like 60 million dollars for his farm

00:12:12.402 --> 00:12:14.608
and turned it down, outside of Vegas.

00:12:14.632 --> 00:12:16.053
He didn't follow his passion.

00:12:16.077 --> 00:12:19.023
He stepped back and he watched
where everybody was going,

00:12:19.047 --> 00:12:21.232
and he went the other way.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.276
And I hear that story over and over.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.872
Matt Freund, a dairy farmer
in New Canaan, Connecticut,

00:12:26.896 --> 00:12:28.622
who woke up one day and realized

00:12:28.646 --> 00:12:31.359
the crap from his cows
was worth more than their milk,

00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:35.265
if he could use it to make
these biodegradable flowerpots.

00:12:35.289 --> 00:12:38.439
Now he's selling them to Walmart, right?

00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:41.291
Follow his passion? The guy's -- come on.

00:12:41.646 --> 00:12:43.853
So I started to look at passion,

00:12:43.877 --> 00:12:47.975
I started to look
at efficiency vs. effectiveness.

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:51.168
As Tim talked about earlier,
that's a huge distinction.

00:12:51.192 --> 00:12:53.671
I started to look at teamwork
and determination.

00:12:53.695 --> 00:12:56.691
And basically, all those platitudes
they call "successories"

00:12:56.715 --> 00:13:00.642
that hang with that schmaltzy art
in boardrooms around the world right now,

00:13:00.666 --> 00:13:05.114
that stuff -- it's suddenly
all been turned on its head.

00:13:05.578 --> 00:13:09.128
Safety. Safety first is ...

00:13:09.239 --> 00:13:13.161
Going back to OSHA and PETA
and the Humane Society:

00:13:13.185 --> 00:13:15.461
What if OSHA got it wrong?

00:13:15.485 --> 00:13:17.832
I mean -- this is heresy,
what I'm about to say --

00:13:17.856 --> 00:13:20.275
but what if it's really safety third?

00:13:20.683 --> 00:13:21.853
Right?

00:13:21.877 --> 00:13:23.303
(Laughter)

00:13:23.327 --> 00:13:25.429
No, I mean, really.

00:13:25.564 --> 00:13:27.372
What I mean to say is:

00:13:27.396 --> 00:13:29.860
I value my safety on these crazy jobs

00:13:29.884 --> 00:13:32.446
as much as the people
that I'm working with,

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.746
but the ones who really get it done --

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.590
they're not out there
talking about safety first.

00:13:38.114 --> 00:13:40.136
They know that other things come first --

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.208
the business of doing
the work comes first,

00:13:42.232 --> 00:13:44.055
the business of getting it done.

00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:46.840
And I'll never forget,
up in the Bering Sea,

00:13:46.864 --> 00:13:49.598
I was on a crab boat
with the "Deadliest Catch" guys --

00:13:49.622 --> 00:13:51.914
which I also work on in the first season.

00:13:51.938 --> 00:13:54.614
We were about 100 miles
off the coast of Russia:

00:13:54.638 --> 00:13:59.035
50-foot seas, big waves, green water
coming over the wheelhouse, right?

00:13:59.059 --> 00:14:01.136
Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.058
and I was back with a guy,
lashing the pots down.

00:14:04.082 --> 00:14:06.238
So I'm 40 feet off the deck,

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:09.160
which is like looking down
at the top of your shoe, you know,

00:14:09.184 --> 00:14:10.791
and it's doing this in the ocean.

00:14:10.815 --> 00:14:11.971
Unspeakably dangerous.

00:14:11.995 --> 00:14:13.929
I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:16.706
and I say, with some level of incredulity,

00:14:17.298 --> 00:14:19.111
"Captain -- OSHA?"

00:14:19.135 --> 00:14:21.207
And he says, "OSHA? Ocean."

00:14:21.716 --> 00:14:23.136
And he points out there.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.491
(Laughter)

00:14:26.515 --> 00:14:31.466
But in that moment, what he said next
can't be repeated in the Lower 48.

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.091
It can't be repeated on any factory floor
or any construction site.

00:14:35.115 --> 00:14:37.000
But he looked at me and said, "Son," --

00:14:37.024 --> 00:14:39.771
he's my age, by the way,
he calls me "son," I love that --

00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:41.970
he says, "Son, I'm the captain
of a crab boat.

00:14:41.994 --> 00:14:44.563
My responsibility
is not to get you home alive.

00:14:44.587 --> 00:14:46.933
My responsibility
is to get you home rich."

00:14:46.957 --> 00:14:48.421
(Laughter)

00:14:48.445 --> 00:14:50.651
You want to get home alive,
that's on you."

00:14:50.675 --> 00:14:53.303
And for the rest
of that day -- safety first.

00:14:53.327 --> 00:14:54.970
I mean, I was like --

00:14:54.994 --> 00:15:01.304
So, the idea that we create
this sense of complacency

00:15:01.328 --> 00:15:05.827
when all we do is talk
about somebody else's responsibility

00:15:05.851 --> 00:15:07.784
as though it's our own, and vice versa.

00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:09.430
Anyhow, a whole lot of things.

00:15:09.454 --> 00:15:12.881
I could talk at length
about the many little distinctions we made

00:15:12.905 --> 00:15:15.761
and the endless list of ways
that I got it wrong.

00:15:15.785 --> 00:15:18.120
But what it all comes down to is this:

00:15:18.144 --> 00:15:19.339
I've formed a theory,

00:15:19.363 --> 00:15:22.778
and I'm going to share it now
in my remaining 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

00:15:22.802 --> 00:15:24.250
It goes like this:

00:15:25.013 --> 00:15:29.977
we've declared war on work,
as a society -- all of us.

00:15:30.001 --> 00:15:31.504
It's a civil war.

00:15:31.933 --> 00:15:33.826
It's a cold war, really.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.136
We didn't set out to do it

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.781
and we didn't twist our mustache
in some Machiavellian way,

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:41.027
but we've done it.

00:15:41.051 --> 00:15:44.750
And we've waged this war
on at least four fronts,

00:15:44.774 --> 00:15:46.257
certainly in Hollywood.

00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:48.891
The way we portray working people on TV --

00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:50.136
it's laughable.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.934
If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds

00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.049
and he's got a giant butt crack, admit it.

00:15:54.073 --> 00:15:55.324
You see him all the time.

00:15:55.348 --> 00:15:57.829
That's what plumbers look like, right?

00:15:57.853 --> 00:16:01.041
We turn them into heroes,
or we turn them into punch lines.

00:16:01.065 --> 00:16:02.247
That's what TV does.

00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:04.612
We try hard on "Dirty Jobs"
not to do that,

00:16:04.636 --> 00:16:07.068
which is why I do the work
and I don't cheat.

00:16:08.382 --> 00:16:11.022
But, we've waged this war
on Madison Avenue.

00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:15.660
So many of the commercials that come out
there in the way of a message --

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:17.137
what's really being said?

00:16:17.161 --> 00:16:19.943
"Your life would be better
if you could work a little less,

00:16:19.967 --> 00:16:22.800
didn't have to work so hard,
got home a little earlier,

00:16:22.824 --> 00:16:25.513
could retire a little faster,
punch out a little sooner."

00:16:25.537 --> 00:16:28.161
It's all in there,
over and over, again and again.

00:16:28.185 --> 00:16:29.336
Washington?

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.391
I can't even begin to talk
about the deals and policies in place

00:16:32.415 --> 00:16:35.924
that affect the bottom-line reality
of the available jobs,

00:16:35.948 --> 00:16:39.511
because I don't really know; I just know
that that's a front in this war.

00:16:39.535 --> 00:16:41.630
And right here, guys -- Silicon Valley.

00:16:41.654 --> 00:16:44.720
I mean -- how many people have
an iPhone on them right now?

00:16:44.744 --> 00:16:46.587
How many people have their BlackBerry?

00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:48.401
We're plugged in; we're connected.

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.688
I would never suggest for a second

00:16:50.712 --> 00:16:53.683
that something bad
has come out of the tech revolution.

00:16:53.707 --> 00:16:55.302
Good grief, not to this crowd.

00:16:55.326 --> 00:16:57.457
(Laughter)

00:16:57.481 --> 00:16:58.764
But I would suggest

00:16:58.788 --> 00:17:03.562
that innovation without imitation
is a complete waste of time.

00:17:04.132 --> 00:17:06.605
And nobody celebrates imitation

00:17:06.629 --> 00:17:10.371
the way "Dirty Jobs" guys
know it has to be done.

00:17:10.395 --> 00:17:13.807
Your iPhone without those people
making the same interface,

00:17:13.831 --> 00:17:16.291
the same circuitry,
the same board, over and over --

00:17:16.315 --> 00:17:19.823
all of that -- that's what makes
it equally as possible

00:17:19.847 --> 00:17:23.033
as the genius that goes inside of it.

00:17:23.057 --> 00:17:25.890
So, we've got this new toolbox. You know?

00:17:25.914 --> 00:17:29.500
Our tools today don't look
like shovels and picks.

00:17:29.524 --> 00:17:32.607
They look like the stuff
we walk around with.

00:17:32.631 --> 00:17:37.850
And so the collective
effect of all of that

00:17:37.874 --> 00:17:43.283
has been this marginalization
of lots and lots of jobs.

00:17:43.307 --> 00:17:46.310
And I realized, probably
too late in this game --

00:17:46.334 --> 00:17:49.788
I hope not, because I don't know
if I can do 200 more of these things --

00:17:49.812 --> 00:17:51.727
but we're going to do as many as we can.

00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:53.812
And to me, the most
important thing to know

00:17:53.836 --> 00:17:55.668
and to really come face to face with,

00:17:55.692 --> 00:17:58.465
is that fact that I got it wrong
about a lot of things,

00:17:58.489 --> 00:18:00.549
not just the testicles on my chin.

00:18:00.573 --> 00:18:03.136
I got a lot wrong.

00:18:03.913 --> 00:18:07.912
So, we're thinking --
by "we," I mean me --

00:18:07.936 --> 00:18:09.826
(Laughter)

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:14.377
that the thing to do is to talk
about a PR campaign for work --

00:18:15.013 --> 00:18:17.290
manual labor, skilled labor.

00:18:17.314 --> 00:18:22.603
Somebody needs to be out there,
talking about the forgotten benefits.

00:18:22.627 --> 00:18:24.388
I'm talking about grandfather stuff,

00:18:24.412 --> 00:18:26.359
the stuff a lot us probably grew up with

00:18:26.383 --> 00:18:30.616
but we've kind of --
you know, kind of lost a little.

00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:33.995
Barack wants to create
two and a half million jobs.

00:18:34.542 --> 00:18:36.198
The infrastructure is a huge deal.

00:18:36.222 --> 00:18:40.278
This war on work that I suppose exists,
has casualties like any other war.

00:18:40.302 --> 00:18:42.136
The infrastructure is the first one,

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.123
declining trade school enrollments
are the second one.

00:18:45.147 --> 00:18:49.988
Every single year, fewer electricians,
fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers,

00:18:50.012 --> 00:18:54.278
fewer welders, fewer pipe fitters,
fewer steam fitters.

00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:58.540
The infrastructure jobs that everybody
is talking about creating

00:18:58.564 --> 00:19:02.240
are those guys -- the ones
that have been in decline, over and over.

00:19:02.264 --> 00:19:05.270
Meanwhile, we've got
two trillion dollars, at a minimum,

00:19:05.294 --> 00:19:07.843
according to the American Society
of Civil Engineers,

00:19:07.867 --> 00:19:11.002
that we need to expend
to even make a dent in the infrastructure,

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:13.272
which is currently rated at a D minus.

00:19:13.296 --> 00:19:17.821
So, if I were running
for anything -- and I'm not --

00:19:17.845 --> 00:19:20.454
I would simply say
that the jobs we hope to make

00:19:20.478 --> 00:19:22.532
and the jobs we hope to create

00:19:22.556 --> 00:19:25.646
aren't going to stick unless
they're jobs that people want.

00:19:26.091 --> 00:19:28.686
And I know the point of this conference

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.617
is to celebrate things
that are near and dear to us,

00:19:31.641 --> 00:19:34.645
but I also know that clean
and dirty aren't opposites.

00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:38.290
They're two sides of the same coin,
just like innovation and imitation,

00:19:38.314 --> 00:19:43.399
like risk and responsibility,
like peripeteia and anagnorisis,

00:19:43.423 --> 00:19:47.054
like that poor little lamb,
who I hope isn't quivering anymore,

00:19:47.078 --> 00:19:48.570
and like my time that's gone.

00:19:48.594 --> 00:19:50.600
It's been great talking to you.

00:19:50.624 --> 00:19:52.136
And get back to work, will you?

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.160
(Applause)
