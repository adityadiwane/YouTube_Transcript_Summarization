00:00:12.418 --> 00:00:15.156
When my father and I started a company

00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:18.432
to 3D print human tissues and organs,

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:21.788
some people initially thought we were a little crazy.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.479
But since then, much progress has been made,

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:27.686
both in our lab and other labs around the world.

00:00:27.686 --> 00:00:30.953
And given this, we started getting questions like,

00:00:30.953 --> 00:00:33.680
"If you can grow human body parts,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.060
can you also grow animal products like meat and leather?"

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.502
When someone first suggested this to me,

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:44.456
quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy,

00:00:44.456 --> 00:00:46.559
but what I soon came to realize

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.805
was that this is not so crazy after all.

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:52.774
What's crazy is what we do today.

00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:54.963
I'm convinced that in 30 years,

00:00:54.963 --> 00:00:56.685
when we look back on today

00:00:56.685 --> 00:01:00.295
and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:03.198
to make our hamburgers and our handbags,

00:01:03.198 --> 00:01:05.380
we'll see this as being wasteful

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.670
and indeed crazy.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.782
Did you know that today we maintain

00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:14.123
a global herd of 60 billion animals

00:01:14.123 --> 00:01:19.699
to provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods?

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:21.769
And over the next few decades,

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:24.529
as the world's population expands to 10 billion,

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:26.174
this will need to nearly double

00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:28.759
to 100 billion animals.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.368
But maintaining this herd

00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:32.667
takes a major toll on our planet.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:36.286
Animals are not just raw materials.

00:01:36.286 --> 00:01:37.909
They're living beings,

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.827
and already our livestock

00:01:39.827 --> 00:01:42.406
is one of the largest users of land,

00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:43.758
fresh water,

00:01:43.758 --> 00:01:46.491
and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases

00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:48.120
which drive climate change.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.450
On top of this,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.674
when you get so many animals so close together,

00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:55.144
it creates a breeding ground for disease

00:01:55.144 --> 00:01:58.727
and opportunities for harm and abuse.

00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:01.257
Clearly, we cannot continue on this path

00:02:01.257 --> 00:02:05.080
which puts the environment, public health,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.522
and food security at risk.

00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:11.088
There is another way, because essentially,

00:02:11.088 --> 00:02:15.374
animal products are just collections of tissues,

00:02:15.374 --> 00:02:17.798
and right now we breed and raise

00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:19.727
highly complex animals

00:02:19.727 --> 00:02:21.418
only to create products

00:02:21.418 --> 00:02:24.133
that are made of relatively simple tissues.

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:27.343
What if, instead of starting with a complex

00:02:27.343 --> 00:02:29.465
and sentient animal,

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:33.013
we started with what the tissues are made of,

00:02:33.013 --> 00:02:35.559
the basic unit of life,

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.040
the cell?

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.760
This is biofabrication, where cells themselves

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.386
can be used to grow biological products

00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:46.278
like tissues and organs.

00:02:46.278 --> 00:02:47.976
Already in medicine,

00:02:47.976 --> 00:02:50.179
biofabrication techniques have been used

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:52.615
to grow sophisticated body parts,

00:02:52.615 --> 00:02:57.513
like ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone,

00:02:57.513 --> 00:03:00.747
that have been successfully implanted into patients.

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:04.855
And beyond medicine, biofabrication can be

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:09.621
a humane, sustainable and scalable new industry.

00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:15.431
And we should begin by reimagining leather.

00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:19.701
I emphasize leather because it is so widely used.

00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:24.604
It is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history.

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:26.505
Growing leather is also technically simpler

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:29.280
than growing other animal products like meat.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.390
It mainly uses one cell type,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.515
and it is largely two-dimensional.

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:38.683
It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators.

00:03:38.683 --> 00:03:41.781
Until biofabrication is better understood,

00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:43.966
it is clear that, initially at least,

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:48.017
more people would be willing to wear novel materials

00:03:48.017 --> 00:03:50.652
than would be willing to eat novel foods,

00:03:50.652 --> 00:03:52.603
no matter how delicious.

00:03:52.603 --> 00:03:55.710
In this sense, leather is a gateway material,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.782
a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.666
If we can succeed here,

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:05.942
it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat

00:04:05.942 --> 00:04:08.706
closer on the horizon.

00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:11.171
Now how do we do it?

00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:14.443
To grow leather, we begin by taking cells

00:04:14.443 --> 00:04:17.275
from an animal, through a simple biopsy.

00:04:17.275 --> 00:04:19.283
The animal could be a cow,

00:04:19.283 --> 00:04:21.980
lamb, or even something more exotic.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.032
This process does no harm,

00:04:24.032 --> 00:04:26.934
and Daisy the cow can live a happy life.

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.669
We then isolate the skin cells

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.538
and multiply them in a cell culture medium.

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:32.711
This takes millions of cells

00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:35.830
and expands them into billions.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.444
And we then coax these cells to produce collagen,

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.871
as they would naturally.

00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:42.200
This collagen is the stuff between cells.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.693
It's natural connective tissue.

00:04:44.693 --> 00:04:46.253
It's the extracellular matrix,

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:49.462
but in leather, it's the main building block.

00:04:49.462 --> 00:04:53.175
And what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen

00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:55.152
and we spread them out to form sheets,

00:04:55.152 --> 00:04:58.594
and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another,

00:04:58.594 --> 00:05:02.123
like phyllo pastry, to form thicker sheets,

00:05:02.123 --> 00:05:03.977
which we then let mature.

00:05:03.977 --> 00:05:07.189
And finally, we take this multilayered skin

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:11.112
and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process,

00:05:11.112 --> 00:05:13.288
we create leather.

00:05:13.288 --> 00:05:15.482
And so I'm very excited to show you,

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.631
for the first time,

00:05:17.631 --> 00:05:21.641
the first batch of our cultured leather,

00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:23.204
fresh from the lab.

00:05:23.204 --> 00:05:26.783
This is real, genuine leather,

00:05:26.783 --> 00:05:30.306
without the animal sacrifice.

00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:33.484
It can have all the characteristics of leather

00:05:33.484 --> 00:05:36.969
because it is made of the same cells,

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.918
and better yet,

00:05:38.918 --> 00:05:42.793
there is no hair to remove,

00:05:42.793 --> 00:05:45.326
no scars or insect's bites,

00:05:45.326 --> 00:05:46.766
and no waste.

00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:50.190
This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet,

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.276
a handbag or a car seat.

00:05:53.276 --> 00:05:56.492
It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow

00:05:56.492 --> 00:05:59.307
or an alligator.

00:05:59.322 --> 00:06:01.876
And because we make this material,

00:06:01.876 --> 00:06:04.158
we grow this leather from the ground up,

00:06:04.158 --> 00:06:07.191
we can control its properties in very interesting ways.

00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:09.726
This piece of leather

00:06:09.726 --> 00:06:13.244
is a mere seven tissue layers thick,

00:06:13.244 --> 00:06:17.047
and as you can see, it is nearly transparent.

00:06:17.047 --> 00:06:26.214
And this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque.

00:06:26.214 --> 00:06:29.224
You don't have that kind of fine control

00:06:29.224 --> 00:06:31.513
with conventional leather.

00:06:31.513 --> 00:06:34.758
And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities,

00:06:34.758 --> 00:06:38.523
like softness, breathability,

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:43.720
durability, elasticity and even things like pattern.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.891
We can mimic nature,

00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:49.179
but in some ways also improve upon it.

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:53.177
This type of leather can do what today's leather does,

00:06:53.177 --> 00:06:56.618
but with imagination, probably much more.

00:06:56.618 --> 00:07:00.847
What could the future of animal products look like?

00:07:00.847 --> 00:07:03.206
It need not look like this,

00:07:03.206 --> 00:07:05.939
which is actually the state of the art today.

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:08.931
Rather, it could be much more like this.

00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:11.164
Already, we have been manufacturing with cell cultures

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:13.929
for thousands of years, beginning with products

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:16.558
like wine, beer and yogurt.

00:07:16.558 --> 00:07:19.892
And speaking of food, our cultured food has evolved,

00:07:19.892 --> 00:07:22.153
and today we prepare cultured food

00:07:22.153 --> 00:07:24.471
in beautiful, sterile facilities like this.

00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:27.671
A brewery is essentially a bioreactor.

00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:30.440
It is where cell culture takes place.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.985
Imagine that in this facility,

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.731
instead of brewing beer,

00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:37.312
we were brewing leather

00:07:37.312 --> 00:07:40.009
or meat.

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:42.654
Imagine touring this facility,

00:07:42.654 --> 00:07:46.385
learning about how the leather or meat is cultured,

00:07:46.385 --> 00:07:49.146
seeing the process from beginning to end,

00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:50.542
and even trying some.

00:07:50.542 --> 00:07:53.648
It's clean, open and educational,

00:07:53.648 --> 00:07:56.068
and this is in contrast to the hidden,

00:07:56.068 --> 00:07:58.146
guarded and remote factories

00:07:58.146 --> 00:08:01.627
where leather and meat is produced today.

00:08:01.627 --> 00:08:04.454
Perhaps biofabrication

00:08:04.454 --> 00:08:08.734
is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind.

00:08:08.734 --> 00:08:11.187
It's environmentally responsible,

00:08:11.187 --> 00:08:14.349
efficient and humane.

00:08:14.349 --> 00:08:16.543
It allows us to be creative.

00:08:16.543 --> 00:08:19.763
We can design new materials, new products,

00:08:19.763 --> 00:08:22.962
and new facilities.

00:08:22.962 --> 00:08:26.802
We need to move past just killing animals

00:08:26.802 --> 00:08:28.635
as a resource

00:08:28.635 --> 00:08:34.556
to something more civilized and evolved.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:37.241
Perhaps we are ready for something

00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:42.826
literally and figuratively more cultured.

00:08:42.826 --> 00:08:44.207
Thank you.

00:08:44.207 --> 00:08:50.177
(Applause)
