00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I spent the best part of last year

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
working on a documentary

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
about my own happiness --

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
trying to see

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
if I can actually train my mind

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
in a particular way,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
like I can train my body,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
so I can end up with an improved feeling

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
of overall well-being.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Then this January,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
my mother died,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and pursuing a film like that

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.260
just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.260
So in a very typical, silly designer fashion,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
after years worth of work,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
pretty much all I have to show for it are the titles for the film.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.260
(Music)

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
They were still done

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
when I was on sabbatical with my company in Indonesia.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
We can see the first part here was designed here by pigs.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
It was a little bit too funky,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and we wanted a more feminine point of view

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and employed a duck

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
who did it in a much more fitting way --

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
fashion.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
My studio in Bali

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and monkeys, of course,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
are supposed to be the happiest of all animals.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
So we trained them to be able to do three separate words,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
to lay out them properly.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
You can see,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
The serif is not really in place.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
So of course, what you don't do properly yourself

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
is never deemed done really.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
So this is us climbing onto the trees

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and putting it up over the Sayan Valley

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
in Indonesia.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
In that year, what I did do a lot

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
was look at all sorts of surveys,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
looking at a lot of data on this subject.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And it turns out

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
that men and women

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
report very, very similar levels of happiness.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
This is a very quick overview

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
of all the studies that I looked at.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
That climate plays no role.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
That if you live in the best climate,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
in San Diego in the United States,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
or in the shittiest climate, in Buffalo, New York,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
you are going to be just as happy

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
in either place.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.260
If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S.,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
any salary increase you're going to experience

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
will have only a tiny, tiny influence

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
on your overall well-being.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Black people are just as happy as white people are.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
If you're old or young

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
it doesn't really make a difference.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
If you're ugly or if you're really, really good-looking

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
it makes no difference whatsoever.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
You will adapt to it and get used to it.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
If you have manageable health problems

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
it doesn't really matter.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Now this does matter.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
So now the woman on the right

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
is actually much happier than the guy on the left --

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
meaning that, if you have a lot of friends,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
and you have meaningful friendships,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
that does make a lot of difference.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
As well as being married -- you are likely to be much happier

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
than if you are single.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
A fellow TED speaker, Jonathan Haidt,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
came up with this beautiful little analogy

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.260
between the conscious and the unconscious mind.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
He says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
on this giant elephant, the unconscious.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And the rider thinks

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
that he can tell the elephant what to do,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
but the elephant really has his own ideas.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
If I look at my own life,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
I'm born in 1962 in Austria.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
If I would have been born a hundred years earlier,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
the big decisions in my life would have been made for me --

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.260
meaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in;

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
I would have very much likely

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
entered the same profession that my dad did;

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
and I would have very much likely married a woman

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
that my mom had selected.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
I, of course, and all of us,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
are very much in charge

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
of these big decisions in our lives.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
We live where we want to be --

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
at least in the West.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
We become what we really are interested in.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
We choose our own profession,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and we choose our own partners.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And so it's quite surprising

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
that many of us

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
let our unconscious influence those decisions

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.260
in ways that we are not quite aware of.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
If you look at the statistics

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and you see that the guy called George,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
when he decides on where he wants to live --

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
is it Florida or North Dakota? --

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
he goes and lives in Georgia.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
And if you look at a guy called Dennis,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
when he decides what to become --

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
is it a lawyer, or does he want to become a doctor

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
or a teacher? --

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
best chance is that he wants to become a dentist.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And if Paula decides

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
should she marry Joe or Jack,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.260
somehow Paul sounds the most interesting.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
And so even if we make

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
those very important decisions

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
for very silly reasons,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
it remains statistically true

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
that there are more Georges living in Georgia

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
and there are more Dennises becoming dentists

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and there are more Paulas who are married to Paul

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
than statistically viable.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
(Laughter)

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Now I, of course, thought,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
"Well this is American data,"

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.260
and I thought, "Well, those silly Americans.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
They get influenced by things

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
that they're not aware of.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
This is just completely ridiculous."

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Then, of course, I looked at my mom and my dad --

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
(Laughter)

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Karolina and Karl,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
and grandmom and granddad,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Josefine and Josef.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
So I am looking still for a Stephanie.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
I'll figure something out.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
and see what makes me happy as a designer,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
the easiest answer, of course,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
is do more of the stuff that I like to do

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
and much less of the stuff that I don't like to do --

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
for which it would be helpful

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
to know what it is that I actually do like to do.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
I'm a big list maker,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
so I came up with a list.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
One of them is to think without pressure.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
This is a project we're working on right now

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
with a very healthy deadline.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
It's a book on culture,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and, as you can see,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
culture is rapidly drifting around.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Doing things like I'm doing right now --

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
traveling to Cannes.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
The example I have here

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
is a chair that came out of the year in Bali --

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.260
clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
not being stuck behind

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
a single computer screen all day long

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and be here and there.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
Quite consciously, design projects

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
that need an incredible amount of various techniques,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
just basically to fight

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
straightforward adaptation.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Being close to the content --

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
that's the content really is close to my heart.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
This is a bus, or vehicle,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
for a charity, for an NGO

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.260
that wants to double the education budget in the United States --

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
carefully designed,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.260
so, by two inches, it still clears highway overpasses.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.260
Having end results -- things that come back from the printer well,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
like this little business card for an animation company

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
called Sideshow

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
on lenticular foils.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Working on projects

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
that actually have visible impacts,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.260
like a book for a deceased German artist

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
whose widow came to us

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.260
with the requirement to make her late husband famous.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
It just came out six months ago,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And I think that his widow

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
is going to be very successful on her quest.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
And lately, to be involved in projects

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
where I know about 50 percent of the project

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
technique-wise

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and the other 50 percent would be new.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
So in this case,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
it's an outside projection for Singapore

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
on these giant Times Square-like screens.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
And I of course knew stuff, as a designer,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
about typography,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
even though we worked with those animals not so successfully.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
But I didn't quite know

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
all that much about movement or film.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
But also because the content was very close.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
In this case, "Keeping a Diary

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Supports Personal Development" --

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
I've been keeping a diary since I was 12.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.260
And I've found that it influenced my life and work

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
in a very intriguing way.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
In this case also because

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
it's part of one of the many sentiments

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.260
that we build the whole series on --

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
Thank you so much.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
(Applause)
