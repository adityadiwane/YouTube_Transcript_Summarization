00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
When my brother called me in December of 1998,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
he said, "The news does not look good."

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
This is him on the screen.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
He'd just been diagnosed with ALS,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.260
which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
It paralyzes you. It starts by killing

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
the motor neurons in your spinal cord.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And you go from being a healthy,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
robust 29-year-old male

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
to someone that cannot breathe,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
cannot move, cannot speak.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.260
This has actually been, to me, a gift,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
because we began a journey

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
to learn a new way of thinking about life.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And even though Steven passed away three years ago

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
we had an amazing journey as a family.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
We did not even --

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
I think adversity is not even the right word.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
We looked at this and we said, "We're going to do something with this

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
in an incredibly positive way."

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And I want to talk today

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
about one of the things that we decided to do,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.260
which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Because, as we all know here today,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
it doesn't work very well.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
I want to talk about it in the context of a story.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
This is the story of my brother.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
But it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and go to something more.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
"Given my status, what is the best outcome

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?"

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
is what we are here to do in medicine, is what everyone should do.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And those questions all have variables to them.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
All of our statuses are different.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
All of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
is different, and our paths will be different,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
they are all stories.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
But it's a story until we convert it to data

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and so what we do, this concept we had,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
was to take Steven's status, "What is my status?"

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and go from this concept of walking, breathing,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and then his hands, speak,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and ultimately happiness and function.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
So, the first set of pathologies, they end up in the stick man

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
on his icon,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
but the rest of them are really what's important here.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Because Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
as he was in that pool, he could not walk,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
he could not use his arms -- that's why he had the little floaty things on them,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
did you see those? --

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
he was happy. We were at the beach,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
he was raising his son, and he was productive.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And we took this, and we converted it into data.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
It is a data point of Steven in a context.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Here he is in the pool. But here he is healthy,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
as a builder: taller, stronger,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
got all the women, amazing guy.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Here he is walking down the aisle,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
but he can barely walk now, so it's impaired.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
And he could still hold his wife's hand, but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
can't feed himself.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And here he is, paralyzed completely,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
unable to breathe and move, over this time journey.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
These stories of his life, converted to data.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
He renovated my carriage house

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
when he was completely paralyzed, and unable to speak,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and unable to breathe, and he won an award for a historic restoration.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
So, here's Steven alone, sharing this story in the world.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
And this is the insight, the thing that we are

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
excited about,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
because we have gone away from the community that we are,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
We need to give to others to be successful.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
So, Steven is sharing this story,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
but he is not alone.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
There are so many other people sharing their stories.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Not stories in words, but stories in data and words.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And we convert that information into this structure,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
this understanding, this ability to convert

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
those stories into something that is computable,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
to which we can begin to change the way

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
medicine is done and delivered.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
We did this for ALS. We can do this for depression,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Parkinson's disease, HIV.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
These are not simple, they are not internet scalable;

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
they require thought and processes

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
to find the meaningful information about the disease.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
So, this is what it looks like when you go to the website.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
And I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
the company that myself, my youngest brother

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and a good friend from MIT started.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Here are the actual patients, there are 45,000 of them now,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
sharing their stories as data.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Here is an M.S. patient.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
His name is Mike, and he is uniformly impaired

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
on cognition, vision, walking, sensation.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Each of them can have a different characteristic.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.260
You can see fibromyalgia, HIV, ALS, depression.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
Look at this HIV patient down here, Zinny.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
It's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
But he is working to keep his CD4 count high

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
and his viral level low so he can make his life better.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.260
But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
Look at this, 2,000 people almost, on Copaxone.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
These are patients currently on drugs,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
sharing data.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
I love some of these, physical exercise, prayer.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
on prayer against something? Let's look at prayer.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.260
What I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
These are why people pray.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Here is the schedule of how frequently they -- it's a dose.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
So, anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
and see if they're doing better, they probably are.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Here they are. It's an open network,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
everybody is sharing. We can see it all.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Or, I want to look at anxiety, because people are praying for anxiety.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.260
And here is data on 15,000 people's current anxiety, right now.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
How they treat it,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
the drugs, the components of it,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
their side effects, all of it in a rich environment,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and you can drill down and see the individuals.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
This amazing data allows us to drill down and see

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
what this drug is for --

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
1,500 people on this drug, I think. Yes.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
I want to talk to the 58 patients down here

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
who are taking four milligrams a day.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
And I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:01.260
it for more than two years.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
So, you can see the duration.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.260
All open, all available.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.260
I'm going to log in.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
And this is my brother's profile.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.260
And this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
This is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And you can see here, as this animates over,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Steven's actual data against the background of all other patients,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
against this information.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
The blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
that he has non-genetic ALS.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
You scroll down in this profile and you can see

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
all of his prescription drugs,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
but more than that, in the new version, I can look at this interactively.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
Wait, poor spinal capacity.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Doesn't this remind you of a great stock program?

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Wouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
was as good as the technology we use to make money?

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
Detrol. In the side effects for his drug,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
integrated into that, the stem cell transplant that he had,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:59.260
the first in the world, shared openly for anyone who wants to see it.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
I love here -- the cyberkinetics implant,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.260
which was, again, the only patient's data that was online and available.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.260
You can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
So, you click down on the ALS tab there.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
I'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
I can look at my constipation, how to manage it.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
I can see magnesium citrate, and the side effects

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
from that drug all integrated in the time

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
in which they're meaningful.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
But I want more.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
I don't want to just look at this cool device, I want to take this

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
data and make something even better.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
I want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and his drugs,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
and all of the things that interact among those,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
the side effects, to be in this beautiful data galaxy

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
that we can look at in any way we want to understand it,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
so that we can take this information

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and go beyond just this simple model

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
of what a record is.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
I don't even know what a medical record is.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
I want to solve a problem. I want an application.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
So, can I take this data -- rearrange yourself,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
put the symptoms in the left, the drugs across the top,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and what interacts.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Years after he's had these drugs,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
I learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
including some positive side effects that came from other drugs,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
were making his constipation worse.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
And if anyone's ever had severe constipation,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
and you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life --

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
yes, that was a pun.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
You're trying to manage these,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and this grid is available here,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
and we want to understand it.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
No one's ever had this kind of information.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
So, patients have this. We're for patients.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
This is all about patient health care, there was no doctors on our network.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
This is about the patients.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
So, how can we take this and bring them a tool

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
that they can go back and they can engage the medical system?

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
And we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
"What's something we can use all the time,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
that we can use in the medical care system,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
that everyone will understand?"

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
So, the patients print it out,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
because hospitals usually block us

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
because they believe we are a social network.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
It's actually the most used feature on the website.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
Doctors actually love this sheet, and they're actually really engaged.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
So, we went from this story of Steven

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
and his history to data, and then back to paper,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.260
where we went back and engaged the medical care system.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
And here's another paper.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
This is a journal, PNAS --

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
I think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
of the United States of America.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
You've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
the amazing things they've done.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
This is a report about a drug called lithium.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.260
Lithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
that a group in Italy found

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
slowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
Now, we'll skip the critiques of the paper.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
But the short story is: If you're a patient,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
you want to be on the blue line.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
You don't want to be on the red line, you want to be on the blue line.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
Because the blue line is a better line. The red line

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
is way downhill, the blue line is a good line.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.260
So, you know we said -- we looked at this, and what I love also

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
is that people always accuse these Internet sites

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
So, this is what happened when PNAS published this.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on 16 patients of data

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
in a bad publication.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
And they call the Internet irresponsible.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
Here's the implication of what happens.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
There's this one guy, named Humberto, from Brazil,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
who unfortunately passed away nine months ago,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
who said, "Hey, listen. Can you help us answer this question?

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
Because I don't want to wait for the next trial, it's going to be years.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
I want to know now. Can you help us?"

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
So, we launched some tools, we let them track their blood levels.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
We let them share the data and exchange it.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
You know, a data network.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
And they said, you know, "Jamie, PLM,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
can you guys tell us whether this works or not?"

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And we went around and we talked to people,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
and they said, "You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know?

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
You don't have the blinding, you don't have data,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
it doesn't follow the scientific method.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
It's never going to work. You can't do it."

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
So, I said, "Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder."

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
(Laughter)

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
I can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
but I can say whether it works in Humberto.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
I bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
that came in Leopard. And we said -- because it's really cool,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
and find everything you've lost, and I loved it.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.260
And I said, "What if we built a time machine for patients,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
except instead of going backwards, we go forwards.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
Can we find out what's going to happen to you,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
so that you can maybe change it?"

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
So, we did. We took all the patients like Humberto,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
That's the Apple background, we stole that because we didn't have time

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
to build our own. This is a real app by the way.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
This is not just graphics.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
And you take those data, and we find the patients like him, and we bring

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.260
their data together. And we bring their histories into it.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And then we say, "Well how do we line them all up?"

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
So, we line them all up so they go together

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
around the meaningful points,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
integrated across everything we know about the patient.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Full information, the entire course of their disease.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
And that's what is going to happen to Humberto,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
unless he does something.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
And he took lithium, and he went down the line.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
And it works almost every time.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
Now, the ones that it doesn't work are interesting.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
But almost all the time it works.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
It's actually scary. It's beautiful.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
So, we couldn't run a clinical trial, we couldn't figure it out.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
And yeah, all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
and all the standard deviation. We'll do that later.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.260
But here is the answer

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
of the mean of the patients that actually decided

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
to take lithium.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
These are all the patients that started lithium.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
It's the Intent to Treat Curve.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.260
You can see here, the blue dots on the top, the light ones,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
those are the people in the study in PNAS

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
that you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
And the ones in the middle are all of our patients

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
from the start of lithium at time zero,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.260
going forward, and then going backward.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
So, you can see we matched them perfectly, perfectly.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Terrifyingly accurate matching.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.260
And going forward, you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
You're actually doing slightly worse -- not significantly,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
but slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
But you know, a lot of people dropped out,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
the trial, there is too much drop out.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Can we do the even harder thing? Can we go to the patients

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.260
that actually decided to stay on lithium,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
because they were so convinced they were getting better?

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
We asked our control algorithm,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
are those 69 patients -- by the way, you'll notice

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial --

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
can we look at those patients and say,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
"Can we match them with our time machine

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
to the other patients that are just like them,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
and what happens?"

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
Even the ones that believed they were getting better

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
matched the controls exactly. Exactly.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Those little lines? That's the power.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
So, we -- I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
that if you did it at a higher dose

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
or if you run the study proper -- I can tell you

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.260
that for those 69 people that took lithium,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
they didn't do any better than the people that were just like them,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
just like me,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and that we had the power to detect that at about

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
We did that one year ahead of the time

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
when the first clinical trial funded by the NIH

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
for millions of dollars failed for futility last week,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
and announced it.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
So, remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
I never really knew whether it worked.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
And I put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
in his lumbar cord,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
and filled out the IRBs and did all this work,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and I never really knew.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
How did I not know?

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
I mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
I actually asked Tim, who is the quant in our group --

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
we actually searched for about a year to find someone

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
in healthcare, couldn't find anybody. So, we went to the finance industry.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
And there are these guys who used to model the future

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
of interest rates, and all that kind of stuff.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
And some of them were available. So, we hired one.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
(Laughter)

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
We hired them, set them up, assisting at lab.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
I I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
is like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
"Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
worked or not?"

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
And he sent me this two days ago.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
It was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time?

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
We have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
Because something went different.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
But my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
It only works about 12 months.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
It's the first version of the time machine.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
First time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
but 12 months so far.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.260
And, you know, I look at this,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
and I get really emotional.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
You look at the patients, you can drill in all the controls,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
you can look at them, you can ask them.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
And I found a woman that had --

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
we found her, she was odd because she had data

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
after she died.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
because he knew how much she cared.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
And I am thankful.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
I can't believe that these people,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
years after my brother had died,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
helped me answer the question about whether

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
an operation I did, and spent millions of dollars on

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
years ago, worked or not.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
I wished it had been there

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
when I'd done it the first time,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
and I'm really excited that it's here now,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:12.260
because the lab that I founded

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
has some data on a drug that might work,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.260
and I'd like to show it.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
I'd like to show it in real time, now,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:25.260
and I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
I've got to thank the 45,000 people

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
that are doing this social experiment with us.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
There is an amazing journey we are going on

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
to become human again,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
to be part of community again,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
to share of ourselves, to be vulnerable,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
and it's very exciting. So, thank you.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:49.260
(Applause)
