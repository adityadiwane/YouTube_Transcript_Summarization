00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:14.633
Last year ...

00:00:14.657 --> 00:00:15.860
was hell.

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:17.682
(Laughter)

00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:23.943
It was my first time eating
Nigerian "jollof."

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:25.549
(Laughter)

00:00:26.436 --> 00:00:29.295
Actually, in all seriousness,

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:32.133
I was going through a lot
of personal turmoil.

00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:35.236
Faced with enormous stress,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.283
I suffered an anxiety attack.

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:41.052
On some days, I could do no work.

00:00:42.156 --> 00:00:44.052
On other days,

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:47.365
I just wanted to lay in my bed and cry.

00:00:48.478 --> 00:00:53.727
My doctor asked if I'd like to speak
with a mental health professional

00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:55.854
about my stress and anxiety.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:57.891
Mental health?

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:02.682
I clammed up and violently
shook my head in protest.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.817
I felt a profound sense of a shame.

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:13.671
I felt the weight of stigma.

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:17.318
I have a loving, supportive family

00:01:17.342 --> 00:01:19.649
and incredibly loyal friends,

00:01:19.673 --> 00:01:24.242
yet I could not entertain
the idea of speaking to anyone

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.296
about my feeling of pain.

00:01:27.824 --> 00:01:32.291
I felt suffocated
by the rigid architecture

00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:34.605
of our African masculinity.

00:01:35.585 --> 00:01:37.700
"People have real problems, Sangu.

00:01:37.724 --> 00:01:39.179
Get over yourself!"

00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:42.757
The first time I heard "mental health,"

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.663
I was a boarding school student
fresh off the boat from Ghana,

00:01:47.687 --> 00:01:49.618
at the Peddie School in New Jersey.

00:01:50.887 --> 00:01:54.293
I had just gone through
the brutal experience

00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:56.870
of losing seven loved ones
in the same month.

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:59.845
The school nurse,

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.933
concerned about what I'd gone
through -- God bless her soul --

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.907
she inquired about my mental health.

00:02:07.246 --> 00:02:09.229
"Is she mental?" I thought.

00:02:10.034 --> 00:02:12.478
Does she not know I'm an African man?

00:02:12.502 --> 00:02:13.516
(Laughter)

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.411
Like Okonkwo in "Things Fall Apart,"

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:20.176
we African men neither process
nor express our emotions.

00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:22.482
We deal with our problems.

00:02:22.506 --> 00:02:24.049
(Applause)

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:27.000
We deal with our problems.

00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:31.795
I called my brother and laughed
about "Oyibo" people -- white people --

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.676
and their strange diseases --

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.938
depression, ADD and those "weird things."

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.311
Growing up in West Africa,

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:44.716
when people used the term "mental,"
what came to mind was a madman

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.983
with dirty, dread-locked hair,

00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:49.783
bumbling around half-naked on the streets.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:52.724
We all know this man.

00:02:52.748 --> 00:02:55.029
Our parents warned us about him.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.185
"Mommy, mommy, why is he mad?"

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.421
"Drugs!

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:00.834
If you even look at drugs,
you end up like him."

00:03:00.858 --> 00:03:02.047
(Laughter)

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.865
Come down with pneumonia,

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.421
and your mother will rush you
to the nearest hospital

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:08.827
for medical treatment.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.526
But dare to declare depression,

00:03:13.278 --> 00:03:16.680
and your local pastor
will be driving out demons

00:03:16.704 --> 00:03:18.548
and blaming witches in your village.

00:03:19.118 --> 00:03:22.018
According to the World
Health Organization,

00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:25.100
mental health is about being able to cope

00:03:25.124 --> 00:03:26.823
with the normal stressors of life;

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:31.184
to work productively and fruitfully;

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:34.835
and to be able to make
a contribution to your community.

00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:41.933
Mental health includes our emotional,
psychological and social well-being.

00:03:42.676 --> 00:03:47.436
Globally, 75 percent
of all mental illness cases

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.094
can be found in low-income countries.

00:03:50.118 --> 00:03:51.950
Yet most African governments

00:03:51.974 --> 00:03:56.181
invest less than one percent
of their health care budget

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:57.481
in mental health.

00:03:58.501 --> 00:03:59.681
Even worse,

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:03.824
we have a severe shortage
of psychiatrists in Africa.

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:08.939
Nigeria, for example,
is estimated to have 200 --

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:12.653
in a country of almost 200 million.

00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:15.711
In all of Africa,

00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:19.638
90 percent of our people
lack access to treatment.

00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:22.254
As a result,

00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:25.282
we suffer in solitude,

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:27.750
silenced by stigma.

00:04:29.318 --> 00:04:33.993
We as Africans often respond
to mental health with distance,

00:04:34.664 --> 00:04:35.866
ignorance,

00:04:36.355 --> 00:04:37.533
guilt,

00:04:37.954 --> 00:04:39.160
fear

00:04:39.754 --> 00:04:41.040
and anger.

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:46.806
In a study conducted by Arboleda-FlÃ³rez,

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.488
directly asking, "What is the cause
of mental illness?"

00:04:51.487 --> 00:04:56.771
34 percent of Nigerian respondents
cited drug misuse;

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.344
19 percent said divine wrath
and the will of God --

00:05:03.368 --> 00:05:04.673
(Laughter)

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.728
12 percent,

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.716
witchcraft and spiritual possession.

00:05:11.616 --> 00:05:16.176
But few cited other known
causes of mental illness,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.846
like genetics,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.806
socioeconomic status,

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.425
war,

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.862
conflict

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:24.401
or the loss of a loved one.

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:28.716
The stigmatization against mental illness

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.206
often results in the ostracizing
and demonizing of sufferers.

00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:38.251
Photojournalist Robin Hammond
has documented some of these abuses ...

00:05:38.275 --> 00:05:39.668
in Uganda,

00:05:40.665 --> 00:05:41.994
in Somalia,

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:44.918
and here in Nigeria.

00:05:47.374 --> 00:05:48.716
For me,

00:05:49.877 --> 00:05:52.196
the stigma is personal.

00:05:53.942 --> 00:05:55.571
In 2009,

00:05:56.616 --> 00:05:59.722
I received a frantic call
in the middle of the night.

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:03.527
My best friend in the world --

00:06:03.551 --> 00:06:08.690
a brilliant, philosophical,
charming, hip young man --

00:06:08.714 --> 00:06:10.865
was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

00:06:12.424 --> 00:06:16.842
I witnessed some of the friends
we'd grown up with recoil.

00:06:19.136 --> 00:06:20.659
I heard the snickers.

00:06:21.448 --> 00:06:23.040
I heard the whispers.

00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:26.236
"Did you hear he has gone mad?"

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.625
(Kru English) "He has gone crazy!"

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.989
Derogatory, demeaning commentary
about his condition --

00:06:34.013 --> 00:06:37.990
words we would never say
about someone with cancer

00:06:38.014 --> 00:06:39.774
or someone with malaria.

00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:44.163
Somehow, when it comes to mental illness,

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:47.237
our ignorance eviscerates all empathy.

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.708
I stood by his side
as his community isolated him,

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.312
but our love never wavered.

00:06:57.668 --> 00:07:00.747
Tacitly, I became passionate
about mental health.

00:07:01.694 --> 00:07:04.326
Inspired by his plight,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.673
I helped found the mental health
special interest alumni group

00:07:07.697 --> 00:07:09.352
at my college.

00:07:09.376 --> 00:07:12.753
And during my tenure as a resident
tutor in graduate school,

00:07:12.777 --> 00:07:16.739
I supported many undergraduates
with their mental health challenges.

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:19.786
I saw African students struggle

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.647
and unable to speak to anyone.

00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:26.562
Even with this knowledge
and with their stories in tow,

00:07:26.586 --> 00:07:28.572
I, in turn, struggled,

00:07:28.596 --> 00:07:33.169
and could not speak to anyone
when I faced my own anxiety,

00:07:33.193 --> 00:07:37.155
so deep is our fear of being the madman.

00:07:39.735 --> 00:07:40.933
All of us --

00:07:41.698 --> 00:07:43.885
but we Africans especially --

00:07:44.775 --> 00:07:50.682
need to realize that our mental struggles
do not detract from our virility,

00:07:50.706 --> 00:07:53.597
nor does our trauma taint our strength.

00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:59.465
We need to see mental health
as important as physical health.

00:08:00.403 --> 00:08:04.806
We need to stop suffering in silence.

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:09.397
We must stop stigmatizing disease

00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:11.627
and traumatizing the afflicted.

00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:14.858
Talk to your friends.

00:08:15.834 --> 00:08:17.410
Talk to your loved ones.

00:08:18.394 --> 00:08:20.159
Talk to health professionals.

00:08:21.437 --> 00:08:22.715
Be vulnerable.

00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:25.492
Do so with the confidence

00:08:26.335 --> 00:08:28.862
that you are not alone.

00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:32.191
Speak up if you're struggling.

00:08:34.414 --> 00:08:37.941
Being honest about how we feel

00:08:37.965 --> 00:08:39.624
does not make us weak;

00:08:40.629 --> 00:08:42.172
it makes us human.

00:08:43.499 --> 00:08:48.045
It is time to end the stigma
associated with mental illness.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.341
So the next time your hear "mental,"

00:08:53.228 --> 00:08:55.223
do not just think of the madman.

00:08:56.163 --> 00:08:57.372
Think of me.

00:08:57.796 --> 00:08:59.720
(Applause)

00:08:59.744 --> 00:09:01.027
Thank you.

00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:05.043
(Applause)
