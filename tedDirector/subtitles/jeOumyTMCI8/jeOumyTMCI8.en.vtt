00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm talking to you about

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.260
the worst form of human rights violation,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.260
the third-largest organized crime,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
a $10 billion industry.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.260
I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
I'd like to tell you the story

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
of these three children,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Pranitha, Shaheen and Anjali.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
a prostituted person.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
She got infected with HIV,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and towards the end of her life,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
when she was in the final stages of AIDS,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
she could not prostitute,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.260
so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
By the time we got the information, we reached there,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Pranitha was already raped by three men.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Shaheen's background I don't even know.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.260
We found her in a railway track,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
raped by many, many men, I don't know many.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
But the indications of that on her body was

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.260
that her intestine was outside her body.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
And when we took her to the hospital

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.260
she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
We still don't know who her parents are, who she is.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
All that we know that hundreds of men

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.260
had used her brutally.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Anjali's father, a drunkard,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.260
sold his child for pornography.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
You're seeing here images of

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.260
three years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.260
who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
In this country, and across the globe,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
hundreds and thousands of children,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
as young as three, as young as four,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
are sold into sexual slavery.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
They are sold in the name of adoption.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
They are sold in the name of organ trade.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
They are sold in the name of forced labor,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.260
camel jockeying, anything, everything.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And I tell you stories from there.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.260
My own journey to work with these children

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
started as a teenager.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.260
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.260
I don't remember the rape part of it so much

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.260
as much as the anger part of it.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Yes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
but that didn't go into my consciousness.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
I never felt like a victim, then or now.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.260
But what lingered from then till now -- I am 40 today --

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.260
is this huge outrageous anger.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Two years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
because I was a victim.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And that's what we do to all traffic survivors.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.260
We, as a society, we have PhDs

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
in victimizing a victim.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Right from the age of 15,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
when I started looking around me,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.260
I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.260
who are left in sexual slavery-like practices,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
but have absolutely no respite,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.260
because we don't allow them to come in.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Where does their journey begin?

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Most of them come from very optionless families,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
not just poor.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
I had this I.S. officer's daughter,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.260
who is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.260
who was raped chatting with one individual,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
who was trafficked.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.260
I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and children from well-to-do families,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
who are getting trafficked.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.260
These people are deceived, forced.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
99.9 percent of them

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.260
resist being inducted into prostitution.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Some pay the price for it.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.260
They're killed; we don't even hear about them.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
They are voiceless, [unclear],

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
nameless people.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.260
But the rest, who succumb into it,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.260
go through everyday torture.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.260
or who want to have a family with you.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
These are men who buy you for an hour, for a day,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
and use you, throw you.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Each of the girls that I have rescued --

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
I have rescued more than 3,200 girls --

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
each of them tell me one story in common ...

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
(Applause)

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
one story about one man, at least,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
putting chili powder in her vagina,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
one man taking a cigarette and burning her,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
one man whipping her.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
We are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
uncles, cousins, all around us.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
And we are silent about them.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
We think it is easy money.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
We think it is shortcut.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.260
We think the person likes to do what she's doing.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
But the extra bonuses that she gets

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
is various infections, sexually transmitted infections,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.260
substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
And one day she gives up on you and me,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
because we have no options for her.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.260
She believes, "Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about."

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.260
And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And it's abnormal to live in a shelter.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
It's abnormal to get rehabilitated.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
It's in that context that I work.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.260
It's in that context that I rescue children.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
I've rescued children as young as three years,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and I've rescued women as old as 40 years.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.260
was where do I begin.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Because I had lots of them

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.260
who were already HIV infected.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
One third of the people I rescue

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
are HIV positive.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
And therefore my challenge was to

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
understand how can I get out

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
the power from this pain.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.260
And for me, I was my greatest experience.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
Understanding my own self,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
understanding my own pain,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
my own isolation,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
was my greatest teacher.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
Because what we did with these girls

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
is to understand their potential.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.260
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
She works for a very big company,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
a workshop in Hyderabad,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
making furnitures.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
She earns around 12,000 rupees.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
She is an illiterate girl,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
trained, skilled as a welder.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Why welding and why not computers?

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.260
We felt, one of the things that these girls had

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.260
is immense amount of courage.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.260
They did not have any pardas inside their body,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
hijabs inside themselves;

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
they've crossed the barrier of it.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.260
And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.260
very easily, and not feel very shy about it.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
We have trained girls as carpenters,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
as masons,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
as security guards, as cab drivers.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.260
And each one of them are excelling

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
in their chosen field,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.260
gaining confidence, restoring dignity,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and building hopes in their own lives.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.260
These girls are also working in big construction companies

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:54.260
like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.260
What has been my challenge?

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.260
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.260
I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.260
I can't hear from my right ear.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
while on a rescue.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
My biggest challenge

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
is society.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
It's you and me.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.260
My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
as our own.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
A very supportive friend of mine,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
a well-wisher of mine,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.260
used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
When her mother fell sick she said,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
"Sunitha, you have so much of contacts.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Can you get somebody in my house to work,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
so that she can look after my mother?"

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
And there is a long pause.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.260
And then she says, "Not one of our girls."

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
in this fantastic A-C hall.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.260
It's very nice for discussion, discourse,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
making films and everything.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.260
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:17.260
It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.260
It's not nice for our children to study with their children.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
There it ends.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
That's my biggest challenge.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.260
If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.260
I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
They need your compassion.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
They need your empathy.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
They need, much more than anything else,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.260
your acceptance.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
Many times when I talk to people,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
I keep telling them one thing:

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
don't tell me hundred ways

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
how you cannot respond to this problem.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
Can you ply your mind for that one way

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
that you can respond to the problem?

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
And that's what I'm here for,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
asking for your support,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
demanding for your support,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
requesting for your support.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
Can you break your culture of silence?

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Can you speak to at least two persons about this story?

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.260
Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
or something like that.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
I'm asking you, in your limited world,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
can you open your minds? Can you open your hearts?

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.260
Can you just encompass these people too?

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
Because they are also a part of us.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
They are also part of this world.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.260
I'm asking you, for these children,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
whose faces you see, they're no more.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
They died of AIDS last year.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.260
I'm asking you to help them,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
accept as human beings --

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
not as philanthropy, not as charity,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.260
but as human beings who deserve all our support.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.260
I'm asking you this because no child, no human being,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
deserves what these children have gone through.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
Thank you.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:35.260
(Applause)
