00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.835
When I go to parties,

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:18.619
it doesn't usually take very long

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:19.659
for people to find out

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.767
that I'm a scientist and I study sex.

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:27.668
And then I get asked questions.

00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:30.835
And the questions usually have a very particular format.

00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:32.067
They start with the phrase,

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:33.968
"A friend told me,"

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:35.868
and then they end with the phrase,

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:37.785
"Is this true?"

00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:39.171
And most of the time

00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:41.290
I'm glad to say that I can answer them,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.137
but sometimes I have to say,

00:00:43.137 --> 00:00:44.270
"I'm really sorry,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.454
but I don't know

00:00:45.454 --> 00:00:48.538
because I'm not that kind of a doctor."

00:00:48.538 --> 00:00:50.454
That is, I'm not a clinician,

00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:53.645
I'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy.

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:56.578
And my job is to look at lots of different species of animals

00:00:56.578 --> 00:00:59.895
and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work

00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:01.396
when everything's going right,

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:03.014
rather than trying to figure out

00:01:03.014 --> 00:01:04.597
how to fix things when they go wrong,

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:05.798
like so many of you.

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:08.197
And what I do is I look for similarities and differences

00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:10.464
in the solutions that they've evolved

00:01:10.464 --> 00:01:12.048
for fundamental biological problems.

00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:13.897
So today I'm here to argue

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:17.763
that this is not at all

00:01:17.763 --> 00:01:19.664
an esoteric Ivory Tower activity

00:01:19.664 --> 00:01:20.981
that we find at our universities,

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:22.964
but that broad study

00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:25.916
across species, tissue types and organ systems

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:27.551
can produce insights

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:30.935
that have direct implications for human health.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:33.433
And this is true both of my recent project

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.157
on sex differences in the brain,

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:37.076
and my more mature work

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:39.910
on the anatomy and function of penises.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.540
And now you know why I'm fun at parties.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.508
(Laughter)

00:01:43.508 --> 00:01:45.791
So today I'm going to give you an example

00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:47.508
drawn from my penis study

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:49.125
to show you how knowledge

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:50.892
drawn from studies of one organ system

00:01:50.892 --> 00:01:53.873
provided insights into a very different one.

00:01:53.873 --> 00:01:56.891
Now I'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows --

00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:00.407
I did have to explain it to my nine-year-old late last week --

00:02:00.407 --> 00:02:04.158
penises are structures that transfer sperm

00:02:04.158 --> 00:02:05.458
from one individual to another.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.958
And the slide behind me

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.691
barely scratches the surface

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:10.656
of how widespread they are in animals.

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:12.641
There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation.

00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:16.515
You find muscular tubes, modified legs, modified fins,

00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:20.361
as well as the mammalian fleshy, inflatable cylinder

00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:21.996
that we're all familiar with --

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:24.278
or at least half of you are.

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:26.679
(Laughter)

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.417
And I think we see this tremendous variation

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:32.568
because it's a really effective solution

00:02:32.568 --> 00:02:34.734
to a very basic biological problem,

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:37.217
and that is getting sperm in a position

00:02:37.217 --> 00:02:39.769
to meet up with eggs and form zygotes.

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.718
Now the penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion,

00:02:43.718 --> 00:02:46.184
but when internal fertilization evolves,

00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:48.184
penises often follow.

00:02:48.184 --> 00:02:52.601
And the question I get when I start talking about this most often is,

00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:55.517
"What made you interested in this subject?"

00:02:55.517 --> 00:02:59.467
And the answer is skeletons.

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:02.034
You wouldn't think that skeletons and penises

00:03:02.034 --> 00:03:03.885
have very much to do with one another.

00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:06.017
And that's because we tend to think of skeletons

00:03:06.017 --> 00:03:07.667
as stiff lever systems

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:09.350
that produce speed or power.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.917
And my first forays into biological research,

00:03:12.917 --> 00:03:15.735
doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate,

00:03:15.735 --> 00:03:17.286
were really squarely in that realm.

00:03:17.286 --> 00:03:20.403
But when I went to graduate school to study biomechanics,

00:03:20.403 --> 00:03:22.868
I really wanted to find a dissertation project

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:25.767
that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function.

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:27.569
I tried a bunch of different stuff.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.217
A lot of it didn't pan out.

00:03:29.217 --> 00:03:31.051
But then one day I started thinking

00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:32.833
about the mammalian penis.

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:36.851
And it's really an odd sort of structure.

00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:39.668
Before it can be used for internal fertilization,

00:03:39.668 --> 00:03:41.151
its mechanical behavior has to change

00:03:41.151 --> 00:03:42.868
in a really dramatic fashion.

00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:45.466
Most of the time it's a flexible organ.

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:46.750
It's easy to bend.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.744
But before it's brought into use

00:03:48.744 --> 00:03:49.962
during copulation

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:51.720
it has to become rigid,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.735
it has to become difficult to bend.

00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:55.752
And moreover, it has to work.

00:03:55.752 --> 00:03:58.502
A reproductive system that fails to function

00:03:58.502 --> 00:04:01.817
produces an individual that has no offspring,

00:04:01.817 --> 00:04:04.988
and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool.

00:04:04.988 --> 00:04:07.449
And so I thought, "Here's a problem

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.697
that just cries out for a skeletal system --

00:04:10.697 --> 00:04:13.909
not one like this one,

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.966
but one like this one --

00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:19.383
because, functionally,

00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:20.950
a skeleton is any system

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.982
that supports tissue and transmits forces.

00:04:23.982 --> 00:04:26.332
And I already knew that animals like this earthworm,

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:27.778
indeed most animals,

00:04:27.778 --> 00:04:29.071
don't support their tissues

00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:30.865
by draping them over bones.

00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:33.698
Instead they're more like reinforced water balloons.

00:04:33.698 --> 00:04:37.565
They use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton.

00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:39.631
And a hydrostatic skeleton

00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:41.549
uses two elements.

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:43.699
The skeletal support comes from an interaction

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.473
between a pressurized fluid

00:04:45.473 --> 00:04:47.079
and a surrounding wall of tissue

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:51.550
that's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.798
And the interaction is crucial.

00:04:53.798 --> 00:04:57.166
Without both elements you have no support.

00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:58.448
If you have fluid

00:04:58.448 --> 00:05:00.482
with no wall to surround it

00:05:00.482 --> 00:05:01.916
and keep pressure up,

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:03.820
you have a puddle.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.920
And if you have just the wall

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.654
with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension,

00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:09.604
you've got a little wet rag.

00:05:09.604 --> 00:05:12.236
When you look at a penis in cross section,

00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:14.669
it has a lot of the hallmarks

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.719
of a hydrostatic skeleton.

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.228
It has a central space

00:05:18.228 --> 00:05:19.748
of spongy erectile tissue

00:05:19.748 --> 00:05:22.326
that fills with fluid -- in this case blood --

00:05:22.326 --> 00:05:24.725
surrounded by a wall of tissue

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:28.576
that's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen.

00:05:28.576 --> 00:05:31.076
But at the time when I started this project,

00:05:31.076 --> 00:05:34.277
the best explanation I could find for penal erection

00:05:34.277 --> 00:05:38.561
was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues,

00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:40.260
and the spongy tissues filled with blood

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.528
and pressure rose and voila! it became erect.

00:05:43.528 --> 00:05:47.493
And that explained to me expansion --

00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:51.060
made sense: more fluid, you get tissues that expand --

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.077
but it didn't actually explain erection.

00:05:54.077 --> 00:05:57.968
Because there was no mechanism in this explanation

00:05:57.968 --> 00:06:00.935
for making this structure hard to bend.

00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:03.651
And no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue.

00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:06.253
So I thought, wall tissue's important in skeletons.

00:06:06.253 --> 00:06:08.619
It has to be part of the explanation.

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:11.154
And this was the point

00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:13.751
at which my graduate adviser said,

00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:17.134
"Whoa! Hold on. Slow down."

00:06:17.134 --> 00:06:20.502
Because after about six months of me talking about this,

00:06:20.502 --> 00:06:21.818
I think he finally figured out

00:06:21.818 --> 00:06:24.867
that I was really serious about the penis thing.

00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:27.914
(Laughter)

00:06:27.914 --> 00:06:29.963
So he sat me down, and he warned me.

00:06:29.963 --> 00:06:32.139
He was like, "Be careful going down this path.

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.906
I'm not sure this project's going to pan out."

00:06:34.906 --> 00:06:37.438
Because he was afraid I was walking into a trap.

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:42.255
I was taking on a socially embarrassing question

00:06:42.255 --> 00:06:44.590
with an answer that he thought

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.972
might not be particularly interesting.

00:06:46.972 --> 00:06:48.505
And that was because

00:06:48.505 --> 00:06:50.023
every hydrostatic skeleton

00:06:50.023 --> 00:06:52.091
that we had found in nature up to that point

00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:53.888
had the same basic elements.

00:06:53.888 --> 00:06:55.105
It had the central fluid,

00:06:55.105 --> 00:06:56.905
it had the surrounding wall,

00:06:56.905 --> 00:07:00.041
and the reinforcing fibers in the wall

00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:02.459
were arranged in crossed helices

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:04.516
around the long axis of the skeleton.

00:07:04.516 --> 00:07:05.837
So the image behind me

00:07:05.837 --> 00:07:07.466
shows a piece of tissue

00:07:07.466 --> 00:07:09.491
in one of these cross helical skeletons

00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:12.024
cut so that you're looking at the surface of the wall.

00:07:12.024 --> 00:07:13.742
The arrow shows you the long axis.

00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:15.592
And you can see two layers of fibers,

00:07:15.592 --> 00:07:17.293
one in blue and one in yellow,

00:07:17.293 --> 00:07:20.091
arranged in left-handed and right-handed angles.

00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:22.340
And if you weren't just looking at a little section of the fibers,

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.041
those fibers would be going in helices

00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:26.791
around the long axis of the skeleton --

00:07:26.791 --> 00:07:28.924
something like a Chinese finger trap,

00:07:28.924 --> 00:07:30.825
where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.908
And these skeletons have a particular set of behaviors,

00:07:33.908 --> 00:07:35.940
which I'm going to demonstrate in a film.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.091
It's a model skeleton

00:07:37.091 --> 00:07:39.274
that I made out of a piece of cloth

00:07:39.274 --> 00:07:41.827
that I wrapped around an inflated balloon.

00:07:41.827 --> 00:07:43.525
The cloth's cut on the bias.

00:07:43.525 --> 00:07:46.274
So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices,

00:07:46.274 --> 00:07:50.586
and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves,

00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:52.015
which means the skeleton's flexible.

00:07:52.015 --> 00:07:54.488
It lengthens, shortens and bends really easily

00:07:54.488 --> 00:07:58.035
in response to internal or external forces.

00:07:58.035 --> 00:07:59.331
Now my adviser's concern

00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:01.697
was what if the penile wall tissue

00:08:01.697 --> 00:08:03.371
is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton.

00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:05.298
What are you going to contribute?

00:08:05.298 --> 00:08:06.765
What new thing are you contributing

00:08:06.765 --> 00:08:08.413
to our knowledge of biology?

00:08:08.413 --> 00:08:11.831
And I thought, "Yeah, he does have a really good point here."

00:08:11.831 --> 00:08:13.581
So I spent a long, long time thinking about it.

00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:15.715
And one thing kept bothering me,

00:08:15.715 --> 00:08:18.165
and that's, when they're functioning,

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:20.098
penises don't wiggle.

00:08:20.098 --> 00:08:22.437
(Laughter)

00:08:22.437 --> 00:08:25.338
So something interesting had to be going on.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:28.639
So I went ahead, collected wall tissue,

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:30.238
prepared it so it was erect,

00:08:30.238 --> 00:08:32.437
sectioned it, put it on slides

00:08:32.437 --> 00:08:35.089
and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look,

00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:40.125
fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety.

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:42.523
But instead I saw this.

00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:45.524
There's an outer layer and an inner layer.

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:48.074
The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton.

00:08:48.074 --> 00:08:50.643
I was really surprised at this.

00:08:50.643 --> 00:08:51.588
Everyone I showed it

00:08:51.588 --> 00:08:52.788
was really surprised at this.

00:08:52.788 --> 00:08:54.325
Why was everyone surprised at this?

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:57.309
That's because we knew theoretically

00:08:57.309 --> 00:09:00.124
that there was another way

00:09:00.124 --> 00:09:03.158
of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton,

00:09:03.158 --> 00:09:05.429
and that was with fibers at zero degrees

00:09:05.429 --> 00:09:09.295
and 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure.

00:09:09.295 --> 00:09:12.857
The thing is, no one had ever seen it before in nature.

00:09:12.857 --> 00:09:15.557
And now I was looking at one.

00:09:15.557 --> 00:09:18.291
Those fibers in that particular orientation

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:21.506
give the skeleton a very, very different behavior.

00:09:21.506 --> 00:09:22.691
I'm going to show a model

00:09:22.691 --> 00:09:24.636
made out of exactly the same materials.

00:09:24.636 --> 00:09:26.694
So it'll be made of the same cotton cloth,

00:09:26.694 --> 00:09:29.983
same balloon, same internal pressure.

00:09:29.983 --> 00:09:32.450
But the only difference

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.832
is that the fibers are arranged differently.

00:09:34.832 --> 00:09:37.483
And you'll see that, unlike the cross helical model,

00:09:37.483 --> 00:09:40.433
this model resists extension and contraction

00:09:40.433 --> 00:09:41.884
and resists bending.

00:09:41.884 --> 00:09:42.918
Now what that tells us

00:09:42.918 --> 00:09:45.014
is that wall tissues are doing so much more

00:09:45.014 --> 00:09:47.517
than just covering the vascular tissues.

00:09:47.517 --> 00:09:51.011
They're an integral part of the penile skeleton.

00:09:51.011 --> 00:09:53.548
If the wall around the erectile tissue wasn't there,

00:09:53.548 --> 00:09:55.713
if it wasn't reinforced in this way,

00:09:55.713 --> 00:09:56.865
the shape would change,

00:09:56.865 --> 00:09:59.249
but the inflated penis would not resist bending,

00:09:59.249 --> 00:10:01.296
and erection simply wouldn't work.

00:10:01.296 --> 00:10:03.897
It's an observation with obvious medical applications

00:10:03.897 --> 00:10:05.679
in humans as well,

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:08.614
but it's also relevant in a broad sense, I think,

00:10:08.614 --> 00:10:11.046
to the design of prosthetics, soft robots,

00:10:11.046 --> 00:10:12.113
basically anything

00:10:12.113 --> 00:10:15.431
where changes of shape and stiffness are important.

00:10:15.431 --> 00:10:17.179
So to sum up:

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:18.396
Twenty years ago,

00:10:18.396 --> 00:10:20.146
I had a college adviser tell me,

00:10:20.146 --> 00:10:22.197
when I went to the college and said,

00:10:22.197 --> 00:10:23.346
"I'm kind of interested in anatomy,"

00:10:23.346 --> 00:10:25.230
they said, "Anatomy's a dead science."

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.847
He couldn't have been more wrong.

00:10:27.847 --> 00:10:30.580
I really believe that we still have a lot to learn

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.713
about the normal structure and function of our bodies.

00:10:33.713 --> 00:10:36.527
Not just about its genetics and molecular biology,

00:10:36.527 --> 00:10:39.926
but up here in the meat end of the scale.

00:10:39.926 --> 00:10:41.361
We've got limits on our time.

00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:43.626
We often focus on one disease,

00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:44.810
one model, one problem,

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.384
but my experience suggests

00:10:46.384 --> 00:10:48.162
that we should take the time

00:10:48.162 --> 00:10:50.727
to apply ideas broadly between systems

00:10:50.727 --> 00:10:52.601
and just see where it takes us.

00:10:52.601 --> 00:10:56.201
After all, if ideas about invertebrate skeletons

00:10:56.201 --> 00:10:57.667
can give us insights

00:10:57.667 --> 00:10:59.752
about mammalian reproductive systems,

00:10:59.752 --> 00:11:03.801
there could be lots of other wild and productive connections

00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:06.250
lurking out there just waiting to be found.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.102
Thank you.

00:11:08.102 --> 00:11:11.490
(Applause)
