00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.770
They told me that I'm a traitor
to my own profession,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.322
that I should be fired,

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.961
have my medical license taken away,

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:25.443
that I should go back to my own country.

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:28.018
My email got hacked.

00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:31.160
In a discussion forum for other doctors,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.521
someone took credit
for "Twitter-bombing" my account.

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:38.044
Now, I didn't know if this
was a good or bad thing,

00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:40.331
but then came the response:

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.644
"Too bad it wasn't a real bomb."

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:46.600
I never thought that I would do something

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.369
that would provoke this level of anger
among other doctors.

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:52.574
Becoming a doctor was my dream.

00:00:52.574 --> 00:00:53.855
I grew up in China,

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:57.243
and my earliest memories
are of being rushed to the hospital

00:00:57.243 --> 00:01:00.588
because I had such bad asthma
that I was there nearly every week.

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:04.517
I had this one doctor, Dr. Sam,
who always took care of me.

00:01:04.517 --> 00:01:06.556
She was about the same age as my mother.

00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:08.626
She had this wild, curly hair,

00:01:08.626 --> 00:01:12.027
and she always wore
these bright yellow flowery dresses.

00:01:12.027 --> 00:01:13.991
She was one of those doctors who,

00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:16.110
if you fell and you broke your arm,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.427
she would ask you why you weren't laughing

00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:20.665
because it's your humerus. Get it?

00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:24.054
See, you'd groan,

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:27.546
but she'd always make you feel better
after having seen her.

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:29.556
Well, we all have that childhood hero

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:32.188
that we want to grow up
to be just like, right?

00:01:32.188 --> 00:01:34.224
Well, I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam.

00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:39.404
When I was eight,
my parents and I moved to the U.S.,

00:01:39.404 --> 00:01:41.668
and ours became
the typical immigrant narrative.

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:46.186
My parents cleaned hotel rooms
and washed dishes and pumped gas

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:48.043
so that I could pursue my dream.

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:51.495
Well, eventually I learned enough English,

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:53.026
and my parents were so happy

00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:57.085
the day that I got into medical school
and took my oath of healing and service.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.504
But then one day, everything changed.

00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:04.305
My mother called me to tell me
that she wasn't feeling well,

00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:07.735
she had a cough that wouldn't go away,
she was short of breath and tired.

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:11.416
Well, I knew that my mother was someone
who never complained about anything.

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:13.959
For her to tell me
that something was the matter,

00:02:14.038 --> 00:02:16.359
I knew something had to be really wrong.

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:17.678
And it was:

00:02:17.678 --> 00:02:20.835
We found out that she had
stage IV breast cancer,

00:02:20.835 --> 00:02:24.775
cancer that by then had spread
to her lungs, her bones, and her brain.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.214
My mother was brave,
though, and she had hope.

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:30.195
She went through surgery and radiation,

00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:32.574
and was on her third round of chemotherapy

00:02:32.574 --> 00:02:34.761
when she lost her address book.

00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:37.860
She tried to look up her oncologist's
phone number on the Internet

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.433
and she found it,
but she found something else too.

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:41.913
On several websites,

00:02:41.938 --> 00:02:45.493
he was listed as a highly paid
speaker to a drug company,

00:02:45.493 --> 00:02:47.417
and in fact often spoke on behalf

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.973
of the same chemo regimen
that he had prescribed her.

00:02:50.973 --> 00:02:52.570
She called me in a panic,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.288
and I didn't know what to believe.

00:02:54.288 --> 00:02:56.541
Maybe this was the right
chemo regimen for her,

00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:58.822
but maybe it wasn't.

00:02:58.822 --> 00:03:01.972
It made her scared and it made her doubt.

00:03:01.972 --> 00:03:03.682
When it comes to medicine,

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:06.292
having that trust is a must,

00:03:06.292 --> 00:03:10.391
and when that trust is gone,
then all that's left is fear.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.817
There's another side to this fear.

00:03:13.817 --> 00:03:17.000
As a medical student, I was taking care
of this 19-year-old

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.499
who was biking back to his dorm

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:20.638
when he got struck and hit,

00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:23.166
run over by an SUV.

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:24.852
He had seven broken ribs,

00:03:24.852 --> 00:03:26.225
shattered hip bones,

00:03:26.225 --> 00:03:29.424
and he was bleeding inside
his belly and inside his brain.

00:03:29.424 --> 00:03:31.208
Now, imagine being his parents

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:33.368
who flew in from Seattle,
2,000 miles away,

00:03:33.368 --> 00:03:35.764
to find their son in a coma.

00:03:35.764 --> 00:03:38.770
I mean, you'd want to find out
what's going on with him, right?

00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:40.689
They asked to attend our bedside rounds

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.891
where we discussed
his condition and his plan,

00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:44.888
which I thought was a reasonable request,

00:03:44.888 --> 00:03:46.938
and also would give us
a chance to show them

00:03:46.938 --> 00:03:49.128
how much we were trying
and how much we cared.

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.290
The head doctor, though, said no.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.932
He gave all kinds of reasons.

00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:55.814
Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way.

00:03:55.814 --> 00:03:59.950
Maybe they'll stop students
from asking questions.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.387
He even said,

00:04:01.387 --> 00:04:04.593
"What if they see mistakes and sue us?"

00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:08.777
What I saw behind every excuse
was deep fear,

00:04:08.777 --> 00:04:11.499
and what I learned
was that to become a doctor,

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:13.340
we have to put on our white coats,

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.534
put up a wall, and hide behind it.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.367
There's a hidden epidemic in medicine.

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:23.182
Of course, patients are scared
when they come to the doctor.

00:04:23.182 --> 00:04:25.556
Imagine you wake up
with this terrible bellyache,

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:26.742
you go to the hospital,

00:04:26.742 --> 00:04:29.993
you're lying in this strange place,
you're on this hospital gurney,

00:04:29.994 --> 00:04:31.550
you're wearing this flimsy gown,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.709
strangers are coming
to poke and prod at you.

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:35.553
You don't know what's going to happen.

00:04:35.554 --> 00:04:39.532
You don't even know if you're going to get
the blanket you asked for 30 minutes ago.

00:04:39.532 --> 00:04:41.793
But it's not just patients who are scared;

00:04:41.793 --> 00:04:43.660
doctors are scared too.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.526
We're scared of patients
finding out who we are

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:48.656
and what medicine is all about.

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:50.247
And so what do we do?

00:04:50.247 --> 00:04:53.253
We put on our white coats
and we hide behind them.

00:04:53.253 --> 00:04:54.962
Of course, the more we hide,

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:57.761
the more people want to know
what it is that we're hiding.

00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:01.213
The more fear then spirals
into mistrust and poor medical care.

00:05:01.213 --> 00:05:03.489
We don't just have a fear of sickness,

00:05:03.489 --> 00:05:05.723
we have a sickness of fear.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.316
Can we bridge this disconnect

00:05:09.316 --> 00:05:13.135
between what patients need
and what doctors do?

00:05:13.135 --> 00:05:15.051
Can we overcome the sickness of fear?

00:05:15.913 --> 00:05:17.280
Let me ask you differently:

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.103
If hiding isn't the answer,
what if we did the opposite?

00:05:21.103 --> 00:05:25.142
What if doctors were to become
totally transparent with their patients?

00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:29.272
Last fall, I conducted
a research study to find out

00:05:29.272 --> 00:05:32.125
what it is that people want
to know about their healthcare.

00:05:32.128 --> 00:05:34.513
I didn't just want to study
patients in a hospital,

00:05:34.514 --> 00:05:35.964
but everyday people.

00:05:35.965 --> 00:05:39.137
So my two medical students,
Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns,

00:05:39.137 --> 00:05:41.532
literally took their research
to the streets.

00:05:41.532 --> 00:05:45.271
They went to banks,
coffee shops, senior centers,

00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:47.703
Chinese restaurants and train stations.

00:05:49.191 --> 00:05:50.593
What did they find?

00:05:50.593 --> 00:05:51.962
Well, when we asked people,

00:05:51.962 --> 00:05:54.388
"What do you want to know
about your healthcare?"

00:05:54.388 --> 00:05:58.086
people responded with what they want
to know about their doctors,

00:05:58.086 --> 00:05:59.883
because people understand health care

00:05:59.883 --> 00:06:03.863
to be the individual interaction
between them and their doctors.

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.787
When we asked, "What do you
want to know about your doctors?"

00:06:06.787 --> 00:06:08.515
people gave three different answers.

00:06:08.515 --> 00:06:11.308
Some want to know
that their doctor is competent

00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:13.614
and certified to practice medicine.

00:06:13.614 --> 00:06:15.954
Some want to be sure
that their doctor is unbiased

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.402
and is making decisions
based on evidence and science,

00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:20.679
not on who pays them.

00:06:21.544 --> 00:06:23.104
Surprisingly to us,

00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:26.618
many people want to know
something else about their doctors.

00:06:26.618 --> 00:06:29.250
Jonathan, a 28-year-old law student,

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.026
says he wants to find someone
who is comfortable with LGBTQ patients

00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:36.659
and specializes in LGBT health.

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.401
Serena, a 32-year-old accountant,

00:06:38.401 --> 00:06:41.666
says that it's important to her
for her doctor to share her values

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:44.694
when it comes to reproductive choice
and women's rights.

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:47.815
Frank, a 59-year-old
hardware store owner,

00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:50.155
doesn't even like going to the doctor

00:06:50.155 --> 00:06:53.699
and wants to find someone
who believes in prevention first,

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.803
but who is comfortable
with alternative treatments.

00:06:56.803 --> 00:06:59.143
One after another,
our respondents told us

00:06:59.143 --> 00:07:02.621
that that doctor-patient relationship
is a deeply intimate one —

00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:04.587
that to show their doctors their bodies

00:07:04.587 --> 00:07:06.555
and tell them their deepest secrets,

00:07:06.555 --> 00:07:09.627
they want to first understand
their doctor's values.

00:07:09.627 --> 00:07:12.585
Just because doctors
have to see every patient

00:07:12.585 --> 00:07:15.170
doesn't mean that patients
have to see every doctor.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.388
People want to know
about their doctors first

00:07:17.388 --> 00:07:19.344
so that they can make an informed choice.

00:07:20.792 --> 00:07:22.968
As a result of this, I formed a campaign,

00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:24.442
Who's My Doctor?

00:07:24.442 --> 00:07:27.302
that calls for total
transparency in medicine.

00:07:27.302 --> 00:07:29.534
Participating doctors voluntarily disclose

00:07:29.534 --> 00:07:30.927
on a public website

00:07:30.927 --> 00:07:33.683
not just information
about where we went to medical school

00:07:33.683 --> 00:07:35.029
and what specialty we're in,

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:36.982
but also our conflicts of interest.

00:07:36.982 --> 00:07:39.446
We go beyond
the Government in the Sunshine Act

00:07:39.446 --> 00:07:41.883
about drug company affiliations,

00:07:41.883 --> 00:07:44.887
and we talk about how we're paid.

00:07:44.887 --> 00:07:46.431
Incentives matter.

00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:48.618
If you go to your doctor
because of back pain,

00:07:48.618 --> 00:07:52.447
you might want to know he's getting paid
5,000 dollars to perform spine surgery

00:07:52.447 --> 00:07:56.141
versus 25 dollars to refer you
to see a physical therapist,

00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:59.665
or if he's getting paid the same thing
no matter what he recommends.

00:08:00.549 --> 00:08:03.247
Then, we go one step further.

00:08:03.247 --> 00:08:05.959
We add our values
when it comes to women's health,

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:08.180
LGBT health, alternative medicine,

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.191
preventive health,
and end-of-life decisions.

00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:14.711
We pledge to our patients
that we are here to serve you,

00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:17.456
so you have a right to know who we are.

00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:20.146
We believe that transparency
can be the cure for fear.

00:08:21.555 --> 00:08:24.266
I thought some doctors would sign on
and others wouldn't,

00:08:24.266 --> 00:08:28.570
but I had no idea of the huge backlash
that would ensue.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.719
Within one week of starting
Who's My Doctor?

00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:33.230
Medscape's public forum

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.260
and several online doctors' communities

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.228
had thousands of posts about this topic.

00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:40.288
Here are a few.

00:08:40.288 --> 00:08:42.548
From a gastroenterologist in Portland:

00:08:42.548 --> 00:08:45.760
"I devoted 12 years of my life
to being a slave.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.707
I have loans and mortgages.

00:08:47.707 --> 00:08:50.517
I depend on lunches from
drug companies to serve patients."

00:08:51.985 --> 00:08:54.251
Well, times may be hard for everyone,

00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:55.972
but try telling your patient

00:08:55.972 --> 00:08:58.986
making 35,000 dollars a year
to serve a family of four

00:08:58.986 --> 00:09:00.664
that you need the free lunch.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.041
From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte:

00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:09.639
"I find it an invasion of my privacy
to disclose where my income comes from.

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:11.932
My patients don't disclose
their incomes to me."

00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:16.428
But your patients' sources of income
don't affect your health.

00:09:17.737 --> 00:09:19.932
From a psychiatrist in New York City:

00:09:19.932 --> 00:09:23.351
"Pretty soon we will have to disclose
whether we prefer cats to dogs,

00:09:23.351 --> 00:09:24.982
what model of car we drive,

00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:26.630
and what toilet paper we use."

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:30.168
Well, how you feel
about Toyotas or Cottonelle

00:09:30.168 --> 00:09:32.204
won't affect your patients' health,

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:34.205
but your views
on a woman's right to choose

00:09:34.205 --> 00:09:37.509
and preventive medicine
and end-of-life decisions just might.

00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:41.374
And my favorite,
from a Kansas City cardiologist:

00:09:41.374 --> 00:09:44.456
"More government-mandated stuff?

00:09:44.456 --> 00:09:47.424
Dr. Wen needs to move
back to her own country."

00:09:48.535 --> 00:09:50.145
Well, two pieces of good news.

00:09:50.145 --> 00:09:53.760
First of all, this is meant to be
voluntary and not mandatory,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.040
and second of all, I'm American
and I'm already here.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.287
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:05.512 --> 00:10:08.241
Within a month, my employers
were getting calls

00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:09.641
asking for me to be fired.

00:10:10.633 --> 00:10:13.806
I received mail
at my undisclosed home address

00:10:13.806 --> 00:10:17.300
with threats to contact
the medical board to sanction me.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.407
My friends and family urged me
to quit this campaign.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.771
After the bomb threat, I was done.

00:10:24.823 --> 00:10:26.765
But then I heard from patients.

00:10:26.765 --> 00:10:29.449
Over social media, a TweetChat,

00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:31.377
which I'd learned what that was by then,

00:10:31.377 --> 00:10:34.867
generated 4.3 million impressions,

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:38.772
and thousands of people wrote
to encourage me to continue.

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:40.404
They wrote with things like,

00:10:40.404 --> 00:10:43.530
"If doctors are doing something
they're that ashamed of,

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.990
they shouldn't be doing it."

00:10:46.121 --> 00:10:49.175
"Elected officials have to disclose
campaign contributions.

00:10:49.175 --> 00:10:51.960
Lawyers have to disclose
conflicts of interests.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.782
Why shouldn't doctors?"

00:10:53.782 --> 00:10:56.510
And finally, many people wrote and said,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.678
"Let us patients decide

00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:00.991
what's important
when we're choosing a doctor."

00:11:02.439 --> 00:11:03.833
In our initial trial,

00:11:03.833 --> 00:11:07.436
over 300 doctors have taken
the total transparency pledge.

00:11:08.289 --> 00:11:10.841
What a crazy new idea, right?

00:11:10.841 --> 00:11:13.822
But actually, this is not
that new of a concept at all.

00:11:13.822 --> 00:11:15.614
Remember Dr. Sam, my doctor in China,

00:11:15.614 --> 00:11:18.413
with the goofy jokes and the wild hair?

00:11:18.413 --> 00:11:19.953
Well, she was my doctor,

00:11:19.953 --> 00:11:21.499
but she was also our neighbor

00:11:21.499 --> 00:11:23.681
who lived in the building
across the street.

00:11:23.681 --> 00:11:26.007
I went to the same school as her daughter.

00:11:26.007 --> 00:11:28.267
My parents and I trusted her

00:11:28.267 --> 00:11:30.663
because we knew who she was
and what she stood for,

00:11:30.663 --> 00:11:32.381
and she had no need to hide from us.

00:11:33.551 --> 00:11:37.221
Just one generation ago,
this was the norm in the U.S. as well.

00:11:37.221 --> 00:11:40.697
You knew that your family doctor
was the father of two teenage boys,

00:11:40.697 --> 00:11:42.542
that he quit smoking a few years ago,

00:11:42.542 --> 00:11:44.533
that he says he's a regular churchgoer,

00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:46.850
but you see him twice a year:
once at Easter

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.084
and once when his mother-in-law
comes to town.

00:11:50.492 --> 00:11:51.849
You knew what he was about,

00:11:51.849 --> 00:11:53.626
and he had no need to hide from you.

00:11:54.837 --> 00:11:57.168
But the sickness of fear has taken over,

00:11:57.168 --> 00:11:58.965
and patients suffer the consequences.

00:11:59.859 --> 00:12:01.239
I know this firsthand.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.423
My mother fought
her cancer for eight years.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.213
She was a planner,

00:12:06.238 --> 00:12:08.622
and she thought a lot
about how she wanted to live

00:12:08.623 --> 00:12:09.992
and how she wanted to die.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.101
Not only did she sign advance directives,

00:12:13.101 --> 00:12:16.891
she wrote a 12-page document
about how she had suffered enough,

00:12:16.951 --> 00:12:18.419
how it was time for her to go.

00:12:19.867 --> 00:12:21.901
One day, when I was a resident physician,

00:12:21.901 --> 00:12:24.988
I got a call to say that she was
in the intensive care unit.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.360
By the time I got there,
she was about to be intubated

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.979
and put on a breathing machine.

00:12:31.905 --> 00:12:35.309
"But this is not what she wants,"
I said, "and we have documents."

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:38.891
The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye,

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:43.018
pointed at my then 16-year-old
sister, and said,

00:12:43.043 --> 00:12:45.161
"Do you remember when you were that age?

00:12:45.201 --> 00:12:48.169
How would you have liked to grow up
without your mother?"

00:12:49.568 --> 00:12:52.199
Her oncologist was there too, and said,

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.177
"This is your mother.

00:12:54.177 --> 00:12:56.830
Can you really face yourself
for the rest of your life

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.607
if you don't do everything for her?"

00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:02.435
I knew my mother so well.

00:13:02.435 --> 00:13:05.595
I understood what
her directives meant so well,

00:13:05.595 --> 00:13:07.035
but I was a physician.

00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:13.884
That was the single hardest
decision I ever made,

00:13:13.884 --> 00:13:15.503
to let her die in peace,

00:13:16.933 --> 00:13:19.633
and I carry those words
of those doctors with me

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:20.934
every single day.

00:13:23.142 --> 00:13:25.296
We can bridge the disconnect

00:13:25.356 --> 00:13:29.137
between what doctors do
and what patients need.

00:13:30.157 --> 00:13:32.838
We can get there,
because we've been there before,

00:13:32.838 --> 00:13:35.331
and we know that transparency
gets us to that trust.

00:13:35.331 --> 00:13:38.096
Research has shown us
that openness also helps doctors,

00:13:38.096 --> 00:13:39.702
that having open medical records,

00:13:39.702 --> 00:13:41.739
being willing to talk
about medical errors,

00:13:41.739 --> 00:13:43.429
will increase patient trust,

00:13:43.429 --> 00:13:45.150
improve health outcomes,

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.210
and reduce malpractice.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.690
That openness, that trust,

00:13:48.749 --> 00:13:50.383
is only going to be more important

00:13:50.423 --> 00:13:54.013
as we move from the infectious
to the behavioral model of disease.

00:13:54.013 --> 00:13:57.487
Bacteria may not care so much
about trust and intimacy,

00:13:57.487 --> 00:14:01.430
but for people to tackle
the hard lifestyle choices,

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.728
to address issues like smoking cessation,

00:14:03.728 --> 00:14:06.765
blood-pressure management
and diabetes control,

00:14:06.765 --> 00:14:09.495
well, that requires us to establish trust.

00:14:11.003 --> 00:14:13.873
Here's what other transparent
doctors have said.

00:14:13.873 --> 00:14:16.790
Brandon Combs, an internist in Denver:

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.803
"This has brought me
closer to my patients.

00:14:19.803 --> 00:14:22.502
The type of relationship I've developed —

00:14:22.547 --> 00:14:24.562
that's why I entered medicine."

00:14:26.117 --> 00:14:28.790
Aaron Stupple, an internist in Denver:

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:32.286
"I tell my patients
that I am totally open with them.

00:14:32.286 --> 00:14:34.360
I don't hide anything from them.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.286
This is me. Now tell me about you.

00:14:37.286 --> 00:14:39.518
We're in this together."

00:14:39.518 --> 00:14:41.920
May Nguyen, a family physician in Houston:

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.998
"My colleagues are astounded
by what I'm doing.

00:14:45.998 --> 00:14:48.584
They ask me how I could be so brave.

00:14:48.584 --> 00:14:51.472
I said, I'm not being brave,

00:14:51.552 --> 00:14:52.941
it's my job."

00:14:55.024 --> 00:14:57.218
I leave you today with a final thought.

00:14:58.428 --> 00:15:01.732
Being totally transparent is scary.

00:15:01.772 --> 00:15:05.102
You feel naked, exposed and vulnerable,

00:15:05.102 --> 00:15:08.740
but that vulnerability, that humility,

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.256
it can be an extraordinary benefit
to the practice of medicine.

00:15:13.256 --> 00:15:15.664
When doctors are willing
to step off our pedestals,

00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:17.140
take off our white coats,

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.521
and show our patients who we are
and what medicine is all about,

00:15:20.521 --> 00:15:23.786
that's when we begin
to overcome the sickness of fear.

00:15:23.786 --> 00:15:25.715
That's when we establish trust.

00:15:25.715 --> 00:15:28.175
That's when we change
the paradigm of medicine

00:15:28.175 --> 00:15:29.985
from one of secrecy and hiding

00:15:29.985 --> 00:15:32.344
to one that is fully open and engaged

00:15:32.344 --> 00:15:33.718
for our patients.

00:15:35.027 --> 00:15:36.924
Thank you.

00:15:36.924 --> 00:15:40.924
(Applause)
