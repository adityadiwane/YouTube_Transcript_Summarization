00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:03.703
[The must-watch TED Talks of 2016]

00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:06.865
[Sam Harris: Can we build AI
without losing control over it?]

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.240
At a certain point,

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:10.616
we will build machines
that are smarter than we are.

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.564
And once we have machines
that are smarter than we are,

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.295
they will begin to improve themselves.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.974
We're in the process
of building some sort of god.

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.131
Now would be a good time
to make sure it's a god we can live with.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.327
[Jennifer Kahn: Gene editing
can wipe out mosquitoes forever]

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:25.162
Gene drives have risks,
and those need to be discussed.

00:00:25.187 --> 00:00:28.222
But malaria exists now
and kills 1,000 people a day.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.265
Remember that.

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:34.694
It can be frightening to act,
but sometimes, not acting is worse.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.858
[Jamila Raqib: The secret
to effective nonviolent resistance]

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:39.302
We're not going to end war

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:42.027
by telling people
that violence is morally wrong.

00:00:42.052 --> 00:00:44.024
Instead, we must offer them a tool

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:47.493
that's at least as powerful
and as effective as violence.

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.783
[Alexander Betts: Here's how
we can fix the refugee system]

00:00:49.808 --> 00:00:51.115
Rather than seeing refugees

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.658
as inevitably dependent
upon humanitarian assistance,

00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:57.742
we need to provide them
with opportunities for human flourishing.

00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:00.506
[Adam Foss: A prosecutor's vision for justice]

00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:02.394
Every day, thousands of times a day,

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:05.139
prosecutors around the United States
wield power so great

00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:06.762
that it can bring about catastrophe

00:01:06.787 --> 00:01:11.754
as quickly as it can bring about
opportunity, intervention, support

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.204
and yes, even love.

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:17.463
[Dalia Mogahed: What do you think
when you look at me?]

00:01:17.493 --> 00:01:22.273
What will you choose
at this time of fear and bigotry?

00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:24.166
Will you play it safe?

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:29.095
Or will you join those who say,
"We are better than that?"

00:01:30.378 --> 00:01:31.580
[Tim Urban: Inside the mind
of a procrastinator]

00:01:31.605 --> 00:01:33.989
Both brains have a Rational
Decision-Maker in them,

00:01:34.014 --> 00:01:38.483
but the procrastinator's brain
also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.

00:01:38.523 --> 00:01:40.107
Now, what does this mean
for the procrastinator?

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:43.370
Well, it means everything's fine,
until this happens.

00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:46.079
[Allan Adams: The discovery
of gravitational waves]

00:01:46.104 --> 00:01:49.108
Two black holes,
the densest thing in the universe,

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:53.735
one with a mass of 29 Suns
and one with a mass of 36 Suns,

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:57.716
whirling around each other
100 times per second before they collide.

00:01:57.947 --> 00:02:00.060
And we know it because we heard it.

00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:03.463
[Kenneth Lacovara: Hunting for dinosaurs
showed me our place in the universe]

00:02:03.488 --> 00:02:06.849
Why study the ancient past?
Because it gives us perspective.

00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:10.291
The dinosaurs died
in the world's fifth mass extinction,

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:13.974
snuffed out in a cosmic accident
through no fault of their own.

00:02:14.173 --> 00:02:15.612
They didn't have a choice.

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:19.253
We, on the other hand, do have a choice.

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:22.188
[Camille A. Brown: The visual
history of social dance]

00:02:22.213 --> 00:02:23.425
Why do we dance?

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.110
To move, to let loose, to express.

00:02:27.483 --> 00:02:28.891
Why do we dance together?

00:02:29.338 --> 00:02:31.203
To heal, to remember,

00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:34.156
to say: "We speak a common language.

00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:36.578
We exist, and we are free."

00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:42.491
