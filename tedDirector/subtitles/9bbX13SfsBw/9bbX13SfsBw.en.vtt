00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:15.437
As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.

00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:18.920
It was this wild place
full of color and life,

00:00:19.812 --> 00:00:23.032
home to these alien-looking,
fantastical creatures.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.474
I pictured big sharks
ruling the food chain

00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:28.702
and saw graceful sea turtles
dancing across coral reefs.

00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:30.741
As a marine biologist turned photographer,

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:33.585
I've spent most of my career
looking for places

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:36.839
as magical as those I used
to dream about when I was little.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:38.630
As you can see,

00:00:38.654 --> 00:00:41.280
I began exploring bodies of water
at a fairly young age.

00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:43.320
But the first time
I truly went underwater,

00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:44.745
I was about 10 years old.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.416
And I can still vividly remember
furiously finning

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.915
to reach this old, encrusted
cannon on a shallow coral reef.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:53.107
And when I finally managed
to grab hold of it,

00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:56.216
I looked up, and I was instantly
surrounded by fish

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.189
in all colors of the rainbow.

00:00:58.213 --> 00:01:00.816
That was the day
I fell in love with the ocean.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.205
Thomas Peschak

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.912
Conservation Photographer

00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:06.641
In my 40 years on this planet,

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:08.523
I've had the great privilege to explore

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:10.635
some of its most incredible seascapes

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.647
for National Geographic Magazine

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.298
and the Save Our Seas Foundation.

00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:17.438
I've photographed everything
from really, really big sharks

00:01:17.462 --> 00:01:20.655
to dainty ones that fit
in the palm of your hand.

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.631
I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath
of humpback whales

00:01:23.655 --> 00:01:25.266
feeding just feet away from me

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.114
in the cold seas off Canada's
Great Bear Rainforest.

00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:31.075
And I've been privy to the mating rituals
of green sea turtles

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:32.437
in the Mozambique Channel.

00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:36.185
Everyone on this planet affects
and is affected by the ocean.

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:38.962
And the pristine seas
I used to dream of as a child

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:41.678
are becoming harder and harder to find.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.797
They are becoming more compressed

00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:45.667
and more threatened.

00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:48.245
As we humans continue to maintain our role

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:50.610
as the leading predator on earth,

00:01:50.634 --> 00:01:55.053
I've witnessed and photographed
many of these ripple effects firsthand.

00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:58.249
For a long time, I thought
I had to shock my audience

00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:00.582
out of their indifference
with disturbing images.

00:02:00.606 --> 00:02:02.506
And while this approach has merits,

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.876
I have come full circle.

00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:06.987
I believe that the best way
for me to effect change

00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:08.608
is to sell love.

00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:10.679
I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts

00:02:10.703 --> 00:02:12.188
and as a photographer,

00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:14.022
I have the rare opportunity

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:16.368
to reveal animals and entire ecosystems

00:02:16.392 --> 00:02:19.433
that lie hidden beneath
the ocean's surface.

00:02:19.457 --> 00:02:22.242
You can't love something
and become a champion for it

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:24.401
if you don't know it exists.

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:28.647
Uncovering this -- that is the power
of conservation photography.

00:02:29.154 --> 00:02:31.154
(Music)

00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:35.361
I've visited hundreds of marine locations,

00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:37.311
but there are a handful of seascapes

00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:39.349
that have touched me incredibly deeply.

00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:43.646
The first time I experienced
that kind of high

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.063
was about 10 years ago,

00:02:45.087 --> 00:02:47.922
off South Africa's rugged, wild coast.

00:02:47.946 --> 00:02:49.292
And every June and July,

00:02:49.316 --> 00:02:51.725
enormous shoals of sardines
travel northwards

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:54.074
in a mass migration
we call the Sardine Run.

00:02:54.098 --> 00:02:56.707
And boy, do those fish
have good reason to run.

00:02:56.731 --> 00:03:01.020
In hot pursuit are hoards
of hungry and agile predators.

00:03:01.044 --> 00:03:02.902
Common dolphins hunt together

00:03:02.926 --> 00:03:05.847
and they can separate some
of the sardines from the main shoal

00:03:05.871 --> 00:03:07.275
and they create bait balls.

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.987
They drive and trap the fish upward
against the ocean surface

00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:12.579
and then they rush in to dine

00:03:12.603 --> 00:03:15.414
on this pulsating and movable feast.

00:03:15.438 --> 00:03:17.234
Close behind are sharks.

00:03:17.258 --> 00:03:18.413
Now, most people believe

00:03:18.437 --> 00:03:20.814
that sharks and dolphins
are these mortal enemies,

00:03:20.838 --> 00:03:23.610
but during the Sardine Run,
they actually coexist.

00:03:23.634 --> 00:03:27.805
In fact, dolphins actually
help sharks feed more effectively.

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.411
Without dolphins, the bait balls
are more dispersed

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:35.173
and sharks often end up
with what I call a sardine donut,

00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:36.657
or a mouth full of water.

00:03:36.681 --> 00:03:40.722
Now, while I've had a few spicy moments
with sharks on the sardine run,

00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:42.812
I know they don't see me as prey.

00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:46.039
However, I get bumped and tail-slapped
just like any other guest

00:03:46.063 --> 00:03:47.832
at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.

00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:52.714
From the shores of Africa we travel east,

00:03:52.738 --> 00:03:54.839
across the vastness
that is the Indian Ocean

00:03:54.863 --> 00:03:58.755
to the Maldives, an archipelago
of coral islands.

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:01.317
And during the stormy southwest monsoon,

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.651
manta rays from all across the archipelago

00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:06.928
travel to a tiny speck
in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.

00:04:06.952 --> 00:04:08.135
Armies of crustaceans,

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.373
most no bigger than the size
of your pupils,

00:04:10.397 --> 00:04:13.582
are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.

00:04:14.185 --> 00:04:16.968
When plankton concentrations
become patchy,

00:04:16.992 --> 00:04:18.178
manta rays feed alone

00:04:18.202 --> 00:04:20.914
and they somersault themselves
backwards again and again,

00:04:20.938 --> 00:04:23.289
very much like a puppy
chasing its own tail.

00:04:23.757 --> 00:04:25.757
(Music)

00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:29.504
However, when plankton densities increase,

00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:33.727
the mantas line up head-to-tail
to form these long feeding chains,

00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:37.075
and any tasty morsel that escapes
the first or second manta in line

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.555
is surely to be gobbled up
by the next or the one after.

00:04:41.912 --> 00:04:43.808
As plankton levels peak in the bay,

00:04:43.832 --> 00:04:46.037
the mantas swim closer and closer together

00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:48.422
in a unique behavior
we call cyclone feeding.

00:04:48.852 --> 00:04:51.122
And as they swirl in tight formation,

00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:52.817
this multi-step column of mantas

00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:56.718
creates its own vortex, sucking in
and delivering the plankton

00:04:56.742 --> 00:04:59.550
right into the mantas' cavernous mouths.

00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:03.916
The experience of diving
amongst such masses of hundreds of rays

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.968
is truly unforgettable.

00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:08.881
(Music)

00:05:54.248 --> 00:05:55.929
When I first photographed Hanifaru,

00:05:55.953 --> 00:05:57.515
the site enjoyed no protection

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.162
and was threatened by development.

00:05:59.186 --> 00:06:01.289
And working with NGOs
like the Manta Trust,

00:06:01.313 --> 00:06:03.194
my images eventually helped Hanifaru

00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:05.645
become a marine-protected area.

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.745
Now, fisherman from neighboring islands,

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:09.439
they once hunted these manta rays

00:06:09.463 --> 00:06:12.087
to make traditional drums
from their skins.

00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:15.786
Today, they are the most ardent
conservation champions

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.087
and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.824
in excess of 8 million dollars
every single year.

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:25.531
I have always wanted
to travel back in time

00:06:25.555 --> 00:06:28.145
to an era where maps were mostly blank

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.098
or they read, "There be dragons."

00:06:30.122 --> 00:06:33.706
And today, the closest I've come
is visiting remote atolls

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.422
in the western Indian Ocean.

00:06:35.446 --> 00:06:38.667
Far, far away from shipping lanes
and fishing fleets,

00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:42.025
diving into these waters
is a poignant reminder

00:06:42.049 --> 00:06:44.477
of what our oceans once looked like.

00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:47.130
Very few people have heard
of Bassas da India,

00:06:47.154 --> 00:06:50.575
a tiny speck of coral
in the Mozambique Channel.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:54.345
Its reef forms a protective outer barrier

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:57.045
and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:58.584
for Galapagos sharks.

00:06:58.608 --> 00:07:03.215
These sharks are anything but shy,
even during the day.

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:05.858
I had a bit of a hunch
that they'd be even bolder

00:07:05.882 --> 00:07:07.493
and more abundant at night.

00:07:08.072 --> 00:07:10.072
(Music)

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:18.052
Never before have I encountered

00:07:18.076 --> 00:07:21.349
so many sharks on a single coral outcrop.

00:07:21.373 --> 00:07:24.378
Capturing and sharing moments like this --

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.084
that reminds me why I chose my path.

00:07:29.488 --> 00:07:33.246
Earlier this year, I was on assignment
for National Geographic Magazine

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.888
in Baja California.

00:07:34.912 --> 00:07:37.649
And about halfway down the peninsula
on the Pacific side

00:07:37.673 --> 00:07:39.112
lies San Ignacio Lagoon,

00:07:39.136 --> 00:07:41.650
a critical calving ground for gray whales.

00:07:41.674 --> 00:07:45.940
For 100 years, this coast was the scene
of a wholesale slaughter,

00:07:45.964 --> 00:07:48.376
where more than 20,000
gray whales were killed,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.674
leaving only a few hundred survivors.

00:07:50.698 --> 00:07:53.368
Today the descendents of these same whales

00:07:53.392 --> 00:07:55.255
nudge their youngsters to the surface

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:58.334
to play and even interact with us.

00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:01.247
(Music)

00:08:08.577 --> 00:08:12.997
This species truly has made
a remarkable comeback.

00:08:14.568 --> 00:08:17.539
Now, on the other side
of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo,

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:19.236
a sleepy fishing village.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.694
Decades of overfishing
had brought them close to collapse.

00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:25.178
In 1995, local fisherman
convinced the authorities

00:08:25.202 --> 00:08:27.454
to proclaim their waters a marine reserve.

00:08:27.478 --> 00:08:31.031
But what happened next
was nothing short of miraculous.

00:08:31.055 --> 00:08:35.325
In 2005, after only
a single decade of protection,

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:39.842
scientists measured the largest
recovery of fish ever recorded.

00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:42.277
But don't take my word
for it -- come with me.

00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:45.039
On a single breath, swim with me in deep,

00:08:45.063 --> 00:08:48.095
into one of the largest
and densest schools of fish

00:08:48.119 --> 00:08:50.692
I have ever encountered.

00:08:51.485 --> 00:08:53.485
(Music)

00:09:03.135 --> 00:09:05.969
We all have the ability
to be creators of hope.

00:09:05.993 --> 00:09:07.921
And through my photography,

00:09:07.945 --> 00:09:11.408
I want to pass on the message
that it is not too late for our oceans.

00:09:11.432 --> 00:09:14.867
And particularly, I want to focus
on nature's resilience

00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:18.877
in the face of 7.3 billion people.

00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:20.718
My hope is that in the future,

00:09:20.742 --> 00:09:22.692
I will have to search much, much harder

00:09:22.716 --> 00:09:24.901
to make photographs like this,

00:09:24.925 --> 00:09:27.010
while creating images that showcase

00:09:27.034 --> 00:09:30.053
our respectful coexistence with the ocean.

00:09:30.077 --> 00:09:33.478
Those will hopefully become
an everyday occurrence for me.

00:09:34.836 --> 00:09:37.111
To thrive and survive in my profession,

00:09:37.135 --> 00:09:40.128
you really have to be a hopeless optimist.

00:09:40.152 --> 00:09:42.173
And I always operate on the assumption

00:09:42.197 --> 00:09:45.302
that the next great picture
that will effect change

00:09:45.326 --> 00:09:47.129
is right around the corner,

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:49.486
behind the next coral head,

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.112
inside the next lagoon

00:09:51.136 --> 00:09:53.785
or possibly, in the one after it.

00:09:54.673 --> 00:09:56.673
(Music)
