00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
It is interesting that in the United States,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
the most significant health-care budget

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.330
goes to cardiovascular disease care, whether it's private or public.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
There's no comparison at all.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.330
In Africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.330
And that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.330
A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.330
17 million people die every year from heart disease.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
32 million heart attacks and strokes occur.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.330
Most of this is in developing countries, and the majority is in Africa.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.330
85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
is in developing countries -- not in the West --

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.330
and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
Who is at risk? People like you.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.330
All friends of Africa, that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
should be very concerned about this deplorable situation.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
Has anyone here wondered what will happen

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
if you go back to your room at night,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.330
and you start getting chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating?

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.330
You're having a heart attack. What are you going to do?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.330
Will you fly back to the U.S., Germany, Europe?

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.330
No, you will die. 50 percent will die within 24 hours, if not treated.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
This is what's going on.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
In a look at the map of the U.S. -- the graph here,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
10 million people here, 10 million here.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.330
By the time you get to 50, it's almost no one left in Nigeria --

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
life expectancy is 47.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.330
It's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses --

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.330
they do -- but they do not survive after the time that they reach

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.330
about 45 years old and 50 years old.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
And those are the times they're most productive.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
Those are the times that they should be contributing

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.330
to Africa's development. But they're not there.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.330
The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
If you cannot secure the parents,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
you cannot guarantee the security of the African child.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
What are the risk factors?

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
It's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
These are just for information:

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.330
hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise. The usual suspects.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.330
Right here in Tanzania, 30 percent of individuals have hypertension.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
20 percent are getting treated.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
Only less than one percent are adequately treated.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
If we can treat hypertension alone in Africa,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.330
we'll save 250,000 lives a year. That's quite significant!

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
Easy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.330
In eight short years -- we're here talking about HIV, malaria,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.330
which is all good.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.330
We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
In eight short years, non-communicable diseases

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.330
will become the leading causes of death in Africa.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.330
That is something to keep in mind. We can't deal with it with situations like this.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.330
This is a typical African hospital. We can't depend on the elites --

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:48.330
they go to USA, Germany, U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
You can't depend on foreign aid alone.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
Here is the situation: countries are turning inwards.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
Post-9/11, [the] United States has had a lot of trouble

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
to deal with, their own internal issues.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.330
So, they spend their money trying to fix those problems.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
You can't rightly -- it's not their responsibility,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.330
it is my responsibility. I have to take care of my own problems.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.330
If they help, that's good! But that is not my expectation.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.330
demand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.330
the way we've always done them.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.330
If they have not worked, we have to look for alternative solutions.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
I'm here to talk to you about solutions.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.330
This has been -- what has been a difficult sign to some of us.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
Several years ago, we started thinking about it.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.330
Everyone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.330
We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
Everyone is ready to throw in money,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
in terms of free money aid to developing countries.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Talk about sustainable investment, no one is interested.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
You can't raise money.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States --

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
I live in Nashville, Tennessee, health care capital of America.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
[It's] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
But start telling them, you know,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
we're going to try to do it in Nigeria -- everyone runs away.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.330
That is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
if you want to help Africa, invest money in sustainable development.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.330
Let me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
so you get a glimpse of what we do,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.330
and I'll talk a little bit more about it.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.330
What we have done is to show that high-quality health care,

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
comparable to the best anywhere in the world,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.330
can be done in a developing country environment.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.330
We have 25 positions right now -- all of them trained,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
board certified in the USA, Canada or Britain.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.330
We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
Cleveland Clinic -- everywhere in the U.S. --

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.330
that you will need to do those things in the United States.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.330
(Applause)

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
Additionally, we have a policy

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.330
that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
We take care of everyone.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.330
(Applause)

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
Whether you have one dollar, two dollars -- it doesn't matter.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
And I will tell you how we're able to do it.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.330
We make sure that we select our equipment properly.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.330
We go for modular units. Units that have multi-modality functions

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.330
have modular components. Easy to repair, and because of that,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.330
we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
We emphasize training,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
and we make sure that this process is regenerative.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.330
Very soon we will all be dead and gone, but the problems will stay,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.330
unless we have people taking over from where we stopped.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
We made sure that we produced some things ourselves.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
We do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
We get the generators from the companies.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.330
We manufacture them in-house, ourselves. That keeps the costs down.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.330
So, for a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S. --

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
that you'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars --

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
when we're finished manufacturing it in-house,

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
we come at a price of about two dollars.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.330
(Applause)

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.330
between the rich and poor countries

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
is through education and technology.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
All these problems we're talking about --

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
if we bring development, they will all disappear.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:37.330
Technology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work?

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.330
It's been proved: self-care is cost-effective.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.330
It extends opportunity to the rural centers,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
and we can use expertise in a very smart way.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
This is the way our centers are set up.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
We currently have three locations in the Caribbean,

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
and we're planning a fourth one.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.330
And we have now decided to go into Africa.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
We will be doing the West African Heart Institute

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.330
in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. That project will be starting

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.330
within the next few months. We hope to open in 2008-09.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
And we will do other centers.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.330
This model can be adapted to every disease process.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
All the units, all the centers, are linked

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.330
through a switched hub to a central server,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.330
and all the images are populated to review stations.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:27.330
And we designed this telemedicine solution. It's proprietary to us,

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.330
who is interested in doing it. You can still be profitable.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:41.330
We make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.330
to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world,

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
just by a click of the button.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.330
I'll lead you through, to see how this happens.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.330
This is at the Heart Institute. The doctors from anywhere can log in.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.330
I can call you in Switzerland and say, "Listen, go into our system.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.330
Look at Mrs. Jones. Look at the study, tell me what you think."

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
They'll give me that information,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
and we'll make the care of the patient better.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
The patient doesn't have to travel.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
He doesn't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.330
because of limited expertise.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
We also use [an] electronic medical record system.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.330
I'm happy to say that the things we have implemented --

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:30.330
80 percent of U.S. practices do not have them, and yet the technology is there.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.330
But you know, they have that luxury.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.330
Because if you can't get it in Nashville, you can travel to Birmingham,

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
two hours away, and you'll get it. If you can't get it in Cleveland,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
you can go to Cincinnati. We don't have that luxury,

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.330
so we have to make it happen.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.330
When we do it, we will put the cost of care down.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.330
And we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
And everyone will get the care they deserve.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.330
It cannot just be technology, we recognize that.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.330
Prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.330
But, you know, you have to tell people what can be done.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.330
It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive,

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.330
and they go home and can't do it.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
They need to be alive, they need to feed.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:21.330
We recommend exercise as the most effective, simple, easy thing to do.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.330
We have had walks every year -- every March, April.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:30.330
We form people into groups and make them go into challenges.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.330
Which group loses the most weight, we give them prizes.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:37.330
Which groups record more walking distance by pedometer,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
we give them prizes. We do this constantly.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
We encourage them to bring children.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
That way we start exposing the children from very early on,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.330
on what these issues are. Because once they learn it,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.330
they will stay with it. In doing this we have created

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.330
at least 100 skilled jobs in Jamaica alone,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.330
and these are physicians with expertise and special training.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.330
We have taken care of over 1,000 indigent patients that could have died,

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
including four free pacemakers in patients

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.330
with complete heart block. For those that understand cardiology,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.330
complete heart block means certain death.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.330
If you don't get this pacemaker, you will be dead.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.330
So we are pleased with that.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.330
Indirectly, we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.330
from people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.330
And we've hopefully saved a lot of lives.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:34.330
By the end of this year, we would have contributed over one million dollars

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.330
in indigent care. In the first four months, it's been 340,000 dollars,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:44.330
averaging 85,000 dollars a month. The government will not do that,

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.330
because they have competing needs.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
They need to put resources elsewhere. But we can still do it.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:53.330
People say, "How can you do that?" This is how we can do that.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:58.330
At least 4,000 rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:03.330
have self-confessed that they did not go to Miami

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
because of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:10.330
And, if they went to Miami, they will spend significantly more --

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:15.330
eight to 10 times more. And they feel happy spending it at home,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.330
getting the same quality of care.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:22.330
And for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay,

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.330
it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.330
that do not have the resources to pay.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:33.330
(Applause)

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
For this to work, this progress must be sustainable.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
So, we emphasize training. Training is critical.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.330
We have gone further: we have formed a relationship

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
with the University of Technology, Jamaica,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.330
where I now have an appointment.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
And we are starting a biomedical engineering program,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:55.330
so that we will train people locally, who can repair that equipment.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.330
That way we're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:04.330
We're also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs --

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.330
training people in echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.330
those kinds of things. Now, with that kind of training,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.330
it gives people motivation.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.330
Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:22.330
and all that kind of stuff. In the process, I want you to just hear

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.330
from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.330
(Video) Dr. Jason Topping: My name is Jason Topping.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.330
I'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.330
at the University Hospital of the West Indies.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.330
I came to the Heart Institute in 2006,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:41.330
as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
I spent three months at the Heart Institute.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
There's been no doubt around my colleagues

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.330
about the utility of the training I received here,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:54.330
and I think there's been an increased interest now in --

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:58.330
particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:03.330
Sharon Lazarus: I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:08.330
since the past two years. I received training at this institution.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.330
I think this aspect of training in cardiology

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.330
that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:26.330
is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:31.330
Ernest Madu: The lesson in this is that it can be done, and it can be sustained,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:35.330
and you can make it possible for everyone.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.330
Who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care?

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.330
When have you been appointed to play God?

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:48.330
It is not my decision. My job is to make sure that every person,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:53.330
no matter what fate has assigned to you, will have the opportunity

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.330
to get the best quality health care in life.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.330
Next stop is West African Heart Institute,

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.330
that we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt, Nigeria,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:07.330
as I said before. We will do other centers across West Africa.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:12.330
We will extend the same system into other areas,

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.330
like dialysis treatment.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.330
And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:22.330
we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it,

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.330
and how you can do it. If we do this,

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.330
we can change the face of health care in Africa.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.330
Africa has been good to us; it is time for us to give back to Africa.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.330
I am going. Those who want to come,

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.330
I welcome you to come along with me.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.330
Thank you.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.330
(Applause)
