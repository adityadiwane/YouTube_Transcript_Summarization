00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
So, I was in the hospital for a long time.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
And a few years after I left, I went back,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me --

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
said, "Dan, I have a fantastic new treatment for you."

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
I was very excited. I walked with him to his office.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And he explained to me that, when I shave,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
but on the right side of my face

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I was badly burned so I have no hair,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and this creates lack of symmetry.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And what's the brilliant idea he had?

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
He was going to tattoo little black dots

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
on the right side of my face

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
and make me look very symmetric.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
It sounded interesting. He asked me to go and shave.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Let me tell you, this was a strange way to shave,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
because I thought about it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
and I realized that the way I was shaving then

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
would be the way I would shave for the rest of my life --

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
because I had to keep the width the same.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
When I got back to his office,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
I wasn't really sure.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
I said, "Can I see some evidence for this?"

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
So he showed me some pictures

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
of little cheeks with little black dots --

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
not very informative.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
I said, "What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
What would happen then?"

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
"Oh, don't worry about it," he said.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
"We have lasers; we can whiten it out."

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
But I was still concerned,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
so I said, "You know what, I'm not going to do it."

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.260
And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
This is coming from a Jewish guy, all right, so that means a lot.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
(Laughter)

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
And he said, "Dan, what's wrong with you?

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric?

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this?

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
Do women feel pity for you

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and have sex with you more frequently?"

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
None of those happened.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And this was very surprising to me,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
because I've gone through many treatments --

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
there were many treatments I decided not to do --

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and I never got this guilt trip to this extent.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
But I decided not to have this treatment.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And I went to his deputy and asked him, "What was going on?

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Where was this guilt trip coming from?"

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.260
And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
(Laughter)

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Now you probably think that this guy's a schmuck.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Right, that's what he seems like.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
But let me give you a different perspective on the same story.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
A few years ago, I was running some of my own experiments in the lab.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And when we run experiments,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
another group that I thought their performance would be very low,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and when I got the results, that's what we got --

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
I was very happy -- aside from one person.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
There was one person in the group

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
that was supposed to have very high performance

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
that was actually performing terribly.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And he pulled the whole mean down,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
destroying my statistical significance of the test.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
So I looked carefully at this guy.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
And I remembered that the old and drunken guy

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
came one day to the lab

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
wanting to make some easy cash

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and this was the guy.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
"Fantastic!" I thought. "Let's throw him out.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample?"

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
But a couple of days later,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
we thought about it with my students,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and we said, "What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
What would have happened if he was in the other group?

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Would we have thrown him out then?"

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
We probably wouldn't have looked at the data at all,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and if we did look at the data,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
we'd probably have said, "Fantastic! What a smart guy who is performing this low,"

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
giving us even stronger statistical results than we could.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
But you know, these stories,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and lots of other experiments that we've done on conflicts of interest,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
basically kind of bring two points

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
to the foreground for me.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
The first one is that in life we encounter many people

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
who, in some way or another,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
try to tattoo our faces.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and give us advice that is inherently biased.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
And I'm sure that it's something that we all recognize,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and we see that it happens.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Maybe we don't recognize it every time,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
but we understand that it happens.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
The most difficult thing, of course, is to recognize

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
that sometimes we too

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
are blinded by our own incentives.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
And that's a much, much more difficult lesson to take into account.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Because we don't see how conflicts of interest work on us.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
When I was doing these experiments,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
in my mind, I was helping science.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
I was eliminating the data

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
to get the true pattern of the data to shine through.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
I wasn't doing something bad.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
In my mind, I was actually a knight

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
trying to help science move along.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
But this was not the case.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
And I think the real challenge is to figure out

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
where are the cases in our lives

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
where conflicts of interest work on us,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
but to try to do things

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
I do want to leave you with one positive thought.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
I mean, this is all very depressing, right --

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
people have conflicts of interest, we don't see it, and so on.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
The positive perspective, I think, of all of this

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
is that, if we do understand when we go wrong,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
if we understand the deep mechanisms

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
of why we fail and where we fail,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
we can actually hope to fix things.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
And that, I think, is the hope. Thank you very much.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.260
(Applause)
