00:00:15.984 --> 00:00:18.232
This is poo,

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:20.715
and what I want to do today is share my passion

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:23.858
for poo with you,

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:26.671
which might be quite difficult,

00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:29.764
but I think what you might find more fascinating

00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:32.965
is the way these small animals deal with poo.

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:35.317
So this animal here has got a brain

00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:39.277
about the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do things

00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:43.027
that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing.

00:00:43.027 --> 00:00:47.149
And basically it's all evolved to handle its food source,

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.283
which is dung.

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:51.862
So the question is, where do we start this story?

00:00:51.862 --> 00:00:54.887
And it seems appropriate to start at the end,

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:57.672
because this is a waste product that comes out

00:00:57.672 --> 00:01:01.245
of other animals, but it still contains nutrients

00:01:01.245 --> 00:01:03.202
and there are sufficient nutrients in there

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:06.165
for dung beetles basically to make a living,

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:09.100
and so dung beetles eat dung, and their larvae

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.255
are also dung-feeders.

00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:14.485
They are grown completely in a ball of dung.

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:18.280
Within South Africa, we've got about 800 species of dung beetles,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.550
in Africa we've got 2,000 species of dung beetles,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.148
and in the world we have about 6,000 species of dung beetles.

00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:31.286
So, according to dung beetles, dung is pretty good.

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:33.958
Unless you're prepared to get dung under your fingernails

00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.727
and root through the dung itself, you'll never see

00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:39.018
90 percent of the dung beetle species,

00:01:39.018 --> 00:01:41.424
because they go directly into the dung,

00:01:41.424 --> 00:01:44.036
straight down below it, and then they shuttle back and forth

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:46.091
between the dung at the soil surface

00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:49.031
and a nest they make underground.

00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:54.276
So the question is, how do they deal with this material?

00:01:54.276 --> 00:01:58.256
And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort.

00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:01.936
Ten percent of the species actually make a ball,

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:06.098
and this ball they roll away from the dung source,

00:02:06.098 --> 00:02:09.534
usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source,

00:02:09.534 --> 00:02:12.839
and they have a very particular behavior

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:17.814
by which they are able to roll their balls.

00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:21.407
So this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.642
You can see it's a male

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.883
because he's got a little hair on the back of his legs there,

00:02:24.883 --> 00:02:29.952
and he's clearly very pleased about what he's sitting on there.

00:02:29.952 --> 00:02:31.864
And then he's about to become a victim

00:02:31.864 --> 00:02:37.113
of a vicious smash-and-grab. (Laughter)

00:02:37.113 --> 00:02:39.811
And this is a clear indication

00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:42.422
that this is a valuable resource.

00:02:42.422 --> 00:02:46.547
And so valuable resources have to be looked after

00:02:46.547 --> 00:02:49.866
and guarded in a particular way, and we think

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:53.168
the reason they roll the balls away is because of this,

00:02:53.168 --> 00:02:55.578
because of the competition that is involved

00:02:55.578 --> 00:02:57.453
in getting hold of that dung.

00:02:57.453 --> 00:03:00.650
So this dung pat was actually -- well, it was a dung pat

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.096
15 minutes before this photograph was taken,

00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:06.145
and we think it's the intense competition

00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:10.025
that makes the beetles so well-adapted

00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:12.714
to rolling balls of dung.

00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:14.747
So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here

00:03:14.747 --> 00:03:18.350
moving across the African veld.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.698
Its head is down. It's walking backwards.

00:03:21.698 --> 00:03:27.069
It's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction,

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.935
and at the same time it's got to deal with the heat.

00:03:29.935 --> 00:03:31.923
This is Africa. It's hot.

00:03:31.923 --> 00:03:33.630
So what I want to share with you now

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.805
are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues

00:03:36.805 --> 00:03:41.646
have used to investigate how dung beetles

00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:43.698
deal with these problems.

00:03:43.698 --> 00:03:46.235
So watch this beetle,

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:50.379
and there's two things that I would like you to be aware of.

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.941
The first is how it deals with this obstacle

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.829
that we've put in its way. See, look, it does a little dance,

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.763
and then it carries on in exactly the same direction

00:03:58.763 --> 00:04:02.453
that it took in the first place.

00:04:02.453 --> 00:04:06.219
A little dance, and then heads off in a particular direction.

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.596
So clearly this animal knows where it's going

00:04:09.596 --> 00:04:10.935
and it knows where it wants to go,

00:04:10.935 --> 00:04:12.820
and that's a very, very important thing,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.235
because if you think about it, you're at the dung pile,

00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:19.758
you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else,

00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:22.651
and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line.

00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:27.030
So we gave them some more tasks to deal with,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.190
and what we did here is we turned the world

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.869
under their feet. And watch its response.

00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:43.343
So this animal has actually had the whole world

00:04:43.343 --> 00:04:46.190
turned under its feet. It's turned by 90 degrees.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.662
But it doesn't flinch. It knows exactly where it wants to go,

00:04:48.662 --> 00:04:51.630
and it heads off in that particular direction.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.822
So our next question then was,

00:04:53.822 --> 00:04:55.782
how are they doing this?

00:04:55.782 --> 00:04:59.231
What are they doing? And there was a cue that was available to us.

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:02.358
It was that every now and then they'd climb on top of the ball

00:05:02.358 --> 00:05:04.990
and they'd take a look at the world around them.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.710
And what do you think they could be looking at

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.386
as they climb on top of the ball?

00:05:08.386 --> 00:05:11.941
What are the obvious cues that this animal could use

00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:16.119
to direct its movement? And the most obvious one

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:20.338
is to look at the sky, and so we thought,

00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:22.602
now what could they be looking at in the sky?

00:05:22.602 --> 00:05:26.711
And the obvious thing to look at is the sun.

00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:29.665
So a classic experiment here,

00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:33.204
in that what we did was we moved the sun.

00:05:33.204 --> 00:05:35.945
What we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board

00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:37.915
and then move the sun with a mirror

00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:39.781
to a completely different position.

00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:41.693
And look at what the beetle does.

00:05:41.693 --> 00:05:44.524
It does a little double dance,

00:05:44.524 --> 00:05:46.803
and then it heads back in exactly the same direction

00:05:46.803 --> 00:05:49.212
it went in the first place.

00:05:49.212 --> 00:05:52.939
What happens now? So clearly they're looking at the sun.

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.201
The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them.

00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:58.826
The thing is the sun is not always available to you,

00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:03.242
because at sunset it disappears below the horizon.

00:06:03.242 --> 00:06:05.826
What is happening in the sky here

00:06:05.826 --> 00:06:09.485
is that there's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky

00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:13.236
that you and I can't see. It's the way our eyes are built.

00:06:13.236 --> 00:06:16.939
But the sun is at the horizon over here

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.906
and we know that when the sun is at the horizon,

00:06:19.906 --> 00:06:21.450
say it's over on this side,

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.035
there is a north-south, a huge pathway across the sky

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:28.508
of polarized light that we can't see

00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:31.306
that the beetles can see.

00:06:31.306 --> 00:06:34.165
So how do we test that? Well, that's easy.

00:06:34.165 --> 00:06:37.107
What we do is we get a great big polarization filter,

00:06:37.107 --> 00:06:41.531
pop the beetle underneath it, and the filter is at right angles

00:06:41.531 --> 00:06:44.181
to the polarization pattern of the sky.

00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:48.351
The beetle comes out from underneath the filter

00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:50.854
and it does a right-hand turn,

00:06:50.854 --> 00:06:53.048
because it comes back under the sky

00:06:53.048 --> 00:06:55.867
that it was originally orientated to

00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:58.212
and then reorientates itself back

00:06:58.212 --> 00:07:02.134
to the direction it was originally going in.

00:07:02.134 --> 00:07:07.951
So obviously beetles can see polarized light.

00:07:07.951 --> 00:07:10.708
Okay, so what we've got so far is,

00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:13.484
what are beetles doing? They're rolling balls.

00:07:13.484 --> 00:07:16.499
How are they doing it? Well, they're rolling them in a straight line.

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:20.077
How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line?

00:07:20.077 --> 00:07:22.772
Well, they're looking at celestial cues in the sky,

00:07:22.772 --> 00:07:25.016
some of which you and I can't see.

00:07:25.016 --> 00:07:26.700
But how do they pick up those celestial cues?

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.744
That was what was of interest to us next.

00:07:29.744 --> 00:07:32.932
And it was this particular little behavior, the dance,

00:07:32.932 --> 00:07:35.851
that we thought was important, because look,

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:37.407
it takes a pause every now and then,

00:07:37.407 --> 00:07:41.886
and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in.

00:07:41.886 --> 00:07:46.123
So what are they doing when they do this dance?

00:07:46.123 --> 00:07:50.465
How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves?

00:07:50.465 --> 00:07:53.961
And in this experiment here, what we did was we forced them

00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:56.623
into a channel, and you can see he wasn't

00:07:56.623 --> 00:07:59.361
particularly forced into this particular channel,

00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:04.659
and we gradually displaced the beetle by 180 degrees

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:08.395
until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction

00:08:08.395 --> 00:08:10.960
that it wanted to go in, in the first place.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.761
And let's see what his reaction is

00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:16.371
as he's headed through 90 degrees here,

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.475
and now he's going to -- when he ends up down here,

00:08:18.475 --> 00:08:21.522
he's going to be 180 degrees in the wrong direction.

00:08:21.522 --> 00:08:23.820
And see what his response is.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.013
He does a little dance, he turns around,

00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:30.747
and heads back in this. He knows exactly where he's going.

00:08:30.747 --> 00:08:33.026
He knows exactly what the problem is,

00:08:33.026 --> 00:08:34.621
and he knows exactly how to deal with it,

00:08:34.621 --> 00:08:37.322
and the dance is this transition behavior

00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:40.131
that allows them to reorientate themselves.

00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:44.923
So that's the dance, but after spending many years

00:08:44.923 --> 00:08:48.579
sitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days,

00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:50.930
we noticed that there was another behavior

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.419
associated with the dance behavior.

00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:57.357
Every now and then, when they climb on top of the ball,

00:08:57.357 --> 00:09:00.763
they wipe their face.

00:09:00.763 --> 00:09:03.726
And you see him do it again.

00:09:03.726 --> 00:09:06.707
Now we thought, now what could be going on here?

00:09:06.707 --> 00:09:09.611
Clearly the ground is very hot, and when the ground is hot,

00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:12.346
they dance more often, and when they do this particular dance,

00:09:12.346 --> 00:09:14.316
they wipe the bottom of their face.

00:09:14.316 --> 00:09:17.015
And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.025
We thought that maybe what they're doing is trying to

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:22.466
get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face

00:09:22.466 --> 00:09:24.882
to cool their head down.

00:09:24.882 --> 00:09:29.324
So what we did was design a couple of arenas.

00:09:29.324 --> 00:09:31.423
one was hot, one was cold.

00:09:31.423 --> 00:09:33.800
We shaded this one. We left that one hot.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.267
And then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera.

00:09:37.267 --> 00:09:41.683
So what you're looking at here is a heat image

00:09:41.683 --> 00:09:45.604
of the system, and what you can see here emerging

00:09:45.604 --> 00:09:49.213
from the poo is a cool dung ball.

00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:52.492
So the truth is, if you look at the temperature over here,

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:57.472
dung is cool. (Laughter)

00:09:57.472 --> 00:10:00.690
So all we're interested in here is comparing the temperature

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.330
of the beetle against the background.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.274
So the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade.

00:10:07.274 --> 00:10:09.882
The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about

00:10:09.882 --> 00:10:11.953
30 to 35 degrees centigrade,

00:10:11.953 --> 00:10:14.619
so this is a great big ball of ice cream

00:10:14.619 --> 00:10:17.746
that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld.

00:10:17.746 --> 00:10:20.449
It isn't climbing. It isn't dancing, because

00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:23.290
its body temperature is actually relatively low.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.363
It's about the same as yours and mine.

00:10:26.363 --> 00:10:31.327
And what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool.

00:10:31.327 --> 00:10:35.634
But if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment,

00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:37.784
look at the temperature of the soil.

00:10:37.784 --> 00:10:41.234
It's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade.

00:10:41.234 --> 00:10:44.676
Watch how often the beetle dances.

00:10:44.676 --> 00:10:49.218
And look at its front legs. They're roaringly hot.

00:10:49.218 --> 00:10:52.141
So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow,

00:10:52.141 --> 00:10:54.075
and the beetle climbs on top of the ball

00:10:54.075 --> 00:10:58.714
and wipes its face, and all the time it's trying to cool itself down,

00:10:58.714 --> 00:11:04.384
we think, and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across.

00:11:04.384 --> 00:11:08.316
And what we did then was put little boots on these legs,

00:11:08.316 --> 00:11:11.278
because this was a way to test if the legs

00:11:11.278 --> 00:11:15.036
were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil.

00:11:15.036 --> 00:11:19.013
And if you look over here, with boots they climb onto the ball

00:11:19.013 --> 00:11:23.204
far less often when they had no boots on.

00:11:23.204 --> 00:11:25.531
So we described these as cool boots.

00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:28.453
It was a dental compound that we used to make these boots.

00:11:28.453 --> 00:11:31.340
And we also cooled down the dung ball, so we were able

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.989
to put the ball in the fridge, gave them a nice cool dung ball,

00:11:34.989 --> 00:11:37.540
and they climbed onto that ball far less often

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.076
than when they had a hot ball.

00:11:39.076 --> 00:11:42.050
So this is called stilting. It's a thermal behavior

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.958
that you and I do if we cross the beach,

00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.676
we jump onto a towel, somebody has this towel --

00:11:46.676 --> 00:11:47.899
"Sorry, I've jumped onto your towel." --

00:11:47.899 --> 00:11:50.463
and then you scuttle across onto somebody else's towel,

00:11:50.463 --> 00:11:52.668
and that way you don't burn your feet.

00:11:52.668 --> 00:11:55.469
And that's exactly what the beetles are doing here.

00:11:55.469 --> 00:11:58.684
However, there's one more story I'd like to share with you,

00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:00.256
and that's this particular species.

00:12:00.256 --> 00:12:03.049
It's from a genus called Pachysoma.

00:12:03.049 --> 00:12:06.081
There are 13 species in the genus, and they have

00:12:06.081 --> 00:12:12.219
a particular behavior that I think you will find interesting.

00:12:12.219 --> 00:12:16.879
This is a dung beetle. Watch what he's doing.

00:12:16.879 --> 00:12:19.569
Can you spot the difference?

00:12:19.569 --> 00:12:22.801
They don't normally go this slowly. It's in slow motion.

00:12:22.801 --> 00:12:24.595
but it's walking forwards,

00:12:24.595 --> 00:12:28.156
and it's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it.

00:12:28.156 --> 00:12:30.610
This is a different species in the same genus

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.482
but exactly the same foraging behavior.

00:12:34.482 --> 00:12:37.273
There's one more interesting aspect of this

00:12:37.273 --> 00:12:41.576
dung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating,

00:12:41.576 --> 00:12:46.082
and that's that it forages and provisions a nest.

00:12:46.082 --> 00:12:48.773
So watch this individual here, and what he's trying to do

00:12:48.773 --> 00:12:51.493
is set up a nest.

00:12:51.493 --> 00:12:53.202
And he doesn't like this first position,

00:12:53.202 --> 00:12:54.825
but he comes up with a second position,

00:12:54.825 --> 00:12:58.682
and about 50 minutes later, that nest is finished,

00:12:58.682 --> 00:13:02.409
and he heads off to forage and provision

00:13:02.409 --> 00:13:04.763
at a pile of dry dung pellets.

00:13:04.763 --> 00:13:07.929
And what I want you to notice is the outward path

00:13:07.929 --> 00:13:12.538
compared to the homeward path, and compare the two.

00:13:12.538 --> 00:13:15.198
And by and large, you'll see that the homeward path

00:13:15.198 --> 00:13:18.029
is far more direct than the outward path.

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:20.844
On the outward path, he's always on the lookout

00:13:20.844 --> 00:13:23.309
for a new blob of dung.

00:13:23.309 --> 00:13:24.860
On the way home, he knows where home is,

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.078
and he wants to go straight to it.

00:13:28.078 --> 00:13:31.653
The important thing here is that this is not a one-way trip,

00:13:31.653 --> 00:13:35.043
as in most dung beetles. The trip here is repeated

00:13:35.043 --> 00:13:39.348
back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site.

00:13:39.348 --> 00:13:40.290
And watch, you're going to see

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.300
another South African crime taking place right now. (Laughter)

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.914
And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets.

00:13:48.914 --> 00:13:52.051
So what we're looking at here

00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:55.379
is a behavior called path integration.

00:13:55.379 --> 00:13:57.996
And what's taking place is that the beetle

00:13:57.996 --> 00:14:02.299
has got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted path

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:05.390
looking for food, and then when it finds food,

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.698
it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is.

00:14:09.698 --> 00:14:12.723
Now there's two ways it could be doing that,

00:14:12.723 --> 00:14:15.683
and we can test that by displacing the beetle

00:14:15.683 --> 00:14:18.380
to a new position when it's at the foraging site.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.674
If it's using landmarks, it will find its home.

00:14:21.674 --> 00:14:25.089
If it is using something called path integration,

00:14:25.089 --> 00:14:28.873
it will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot,

00:14:28.873 --> 00:14:31.297
and what it's doing here if it's using path integration

00:14:31.297 --> 00:14:35.168
is it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction.

00:14:35.168 --> 00:14:38.865
It knows the bearing home, and it knows it should be in that direction.

00:14:38.865 --> 00:14:41.993
If you displace it, it ends up in the wrong place.

00:14:41.993 --> 00:14:44.570
So let's see what happens when we put this beetle

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.886
to the test with a similar experiment.

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:52.272
So here's our cunning experimenter.

00:14:52.272 --> 00:14:54.673
He displaces the beetle,

00:14:54.673 --> 00:14:59.522
and now we have to see what is going to take place.

00:14:59.522 --> 00:15:02.616
What we've got is a burrow. That's where the forage was.

00:15:02.616 --> 00:15:05.563
The forage has been displaced to a new position.

00:15:05.563 --> 00:15:07.922
If he's using landmark orientation,

00:15:07.922 --> 00:15:09.682
he should be able to find the burrow,

00:15:09.682 --> 00:15:12.405
because he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it.

00:15:12.405 --> 00:15:15.448
If he's using path integration,

00:15:15.448 --> 00:15:19.172
then it should end up in the wrong spot over here.

00:15:19.172 --> 00:15:21.482
So let's watch what happens

00:15:21.482 --> 00:15:24.773
when we put the beetle through the whole test.

00:15:24.773 --> 00:15:26.769
So there he is there.

00:15:26.769 --> 00:15:33.029
He's about to head home, and look what happens.

00:15:33.029 --> 00:15:35.522
Shame.

00:15:35.522 --> 00:15:37.756
It hasn't a clue.

00:15:37.756 --> 00:15:40.676
It starts to search for its house in the right distance

00:15:40.676 --> 00:15:46.651
away from the food, but it is clearly completely lost.

00:15:46.651 --> 00:15:50.869
So we know now that this animal uses path integration

00:15:50.869 --> 00:15:54.948
to find its way around, and the callous experimenter

00:15:54.948 --> 00:15:58.069
leads it top left and leaves it. (Laughter)

00:15:58.069 --> 00:16:02.124
So what we're looking at here are a group of animals

00:16:02.124 --> 00:16:04.203
that use a compass, and they use the sun as a compass

00:16:04.203 --> 00:16:05.843
to find their way around,

00:16:05.843 --> 00:16:08.368
and they have some sort of system

00:16:08.368 --> 00:16:10.331
for measuring that distance,

00:16:10.331 --> 00:16:13.668
and we know that these species here actually

00:16:13.668 --> 00:16:16.349
count the steps. That's what they use as an odometer,

00:16:16.349 --> 00:16:21.486
a step-counting system, to find their way back home.

00:16:21.486 --> 00:16:24.309
We don't know yet what dung beetles use.

00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:26.588
So what have we learned from these animals

00:16:26.588 --> 00:16:29.589
with a brain that's the size of a grain of rice?

00:16:29.589 --> 00:16:33.700
Well, we know that they can roll balls in a straight line

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.845
using celestial cues.

00:16:35.845 --> 00:16:38.973
We know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior

00:16:38.973 --> 00:16:41.387
and it's also a thermoregulation behavior,

00:16:41.387 --> 00:16:45.585
and we also know that they use a path integration system

00:16:45.585 --> 00:16:47.674
for finding their way home.

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:51.844
So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:54.613
we can actually learn an awful lot from these things

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:58.245
doing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do.

00:16:58.245 --> 00:17:02.245
Thank you. (Applause)
