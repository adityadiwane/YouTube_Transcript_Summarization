00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160
ages six to eight, at a children's museum,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160
and I brought with me a bag full of legs,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
similar to the kinds of things you see up here,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160
and had them laid out on a table for the kids.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.160
And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
about what they don't know, or don't understand,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
or is foreign to them.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
They only learn to be frightened of those differences

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
when an adult influences them to behave that way,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
and maybe censors that natural curiosity,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
or you know, reins in the question-asking

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
in the hopes of them being polite little kids.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
with these unruly kids, saying, "Now, whatever you do,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
don't stare at her legs."

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
But, of course, that's the point.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
That's why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
So I made a deal with the adults

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
on their own.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
The doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
and they are poking and prodding, and they're wiggling toes,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
to see what happens with that.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
And I said, "Kids, really quickly --

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.160
I woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house --

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
nothing too big, two or three stories --

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.160
but, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
anything you can dream up right now,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
what kind of legs would you build me?"

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
And immediately a voice shouted, "Kangaroo!"

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
"No, no, no! Should be a frog!"

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
"No. It should be Go Go Gadget!"

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
"No, no, no! It should be the Incredibles."

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
And other things that I don't -- aren't familiar with.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
And then, one eight-year-old said,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.160
"Hey, why wouldn't you want to fly too?"

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
And the whole room, including me, was like, "Yeah."

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
(Laughter)

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
And just like that, I went from being a woman

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.160
that these kids would have been trained to see as "disabled"

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.160
to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
Somebody that might even be super-abled.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
Interesting.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.160
So some of you actually saw me at TED, 11 years ago.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.160
And there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.160
for both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.160
TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.160
At the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
which you may have seen on stage yesterday.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.160
And also these very life-like, intrinsically painted silicone legs.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
So at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.160
to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.160
to come bring their talent to the science and to the art

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
of building legs.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.160
So that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function and aesthetic,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
and assigning them different values.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.160
Well, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.160
And the journey started, funny enough, with a TED conference attendee --

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
Chee Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
She was the editor then of a magazine called ID,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
and she gave me a cover story.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
This started an incredible journey.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
Curious encounters were happening to me at the time;

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
on the design of the cheetah legs around the world.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
And people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
men and women.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
And the conversation would go something like this,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.160
"You know Aimee, you're very attractive.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
You don't look disabled."

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.160
(Laughter)

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
I thought, "Well, that's amazing,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
because I don't feel disabled."

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.160
And it really opened my eyes to this conversation

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
that could be explored, about beauty.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
What does a beautiful woman have to look like?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
What is a sexy body?

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
And interestingly, from an identity standpoint,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
what does it mean to have a disability?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
I mean, people -- Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
Nobody calls her disabled.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.160
(Laughter)

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.160
So this magazine, through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.160
went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen, and photographer Nick Knight,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
who were also interested in exploring that conversation.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
So, three months after TED I found myself on a plane

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.160
to London, doing my first fashion shoot,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160
which resulted in this cover --

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
"Fashion-able"?

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Three months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.160
on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
Nobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
Actually, I have them on stage with me:

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.160
grapevines, magnolias -- truly stunning.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
Poetry matters.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.160
Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
to a realm of art.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.160
It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
into something that invites them to look,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
and look a little longer,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
and maybe even understand.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.160
I learned this firsthand with my next adventure.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
The artist Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the "The Cremaster Cycle."

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
This is where it really hit home for me --

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
that my legs could be wearable sculpture.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.160
And even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
as the only aesthetic ideal.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.160
So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160
even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
a.k.a. bowling ball material.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.160
Heavy!

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
Then we made these legs that are cast in soil

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.160
with a potato root system growing in them, and beetroots out the top,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
and a very lovely brass toe.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
That's a good close-up of that one.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
Then another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah --

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
a little homage to my life as an athlete.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
14 hours of prosthetic make-up

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.160
to get into a creature that had articulated paws,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.160
claws and a tail that whipped around,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.160
like a gecko.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.160
(Laughter)

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these --

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
look like jellyfish legs,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
also polyurethane.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
And the only purpose that these legs can serve,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
outside the context of the film,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
So whimsy matters.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.160
Today, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
that various people have made for me,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160
and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
and I can change my height --

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
I have a variable of five different heights.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
(Laughter)

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
Today, I'm 6'1".

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
And I had these legs made a little over a year ago

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
at Dorset Orthopedic in England

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
and when I brought them home to Manhattan,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
my first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
And a girl was there who has known me for years

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
at my normal 5'8".

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
Her mouth dropped open when she saw me,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
and she went, "But you're so tall!"

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
And I said, "I know. Isn't it fun?"

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
I mean, it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
that I never expected I would ever have.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
And I was having fun with it.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
And she looked at me,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
and she said, "But, Aimee, that's not fair."

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
(Laughter)

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
(Applause)

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.160
And the incredible thing was she really meant it.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
It's not fair that you can change your height,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
as you want it.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
And that's when I knew --

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
that's when I knew that the conversation with society

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
has changed profoundly

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
in this last decade.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.160
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160
It's a conversation about augmentation.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.160
It's a conversation about potential.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.160
A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.160
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
in that space.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
So people that society once considered to be disabled

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.160
can now become the architects of their own identities

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
and indeed continue to change those identities

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.160
by designing their bodies

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
from a place of empowerment.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.160
And what is exciting to me so much right now

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.160
is that by combining cutting-edge technology --

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
robotics, bionics --

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
with the age-old poetry,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.160
we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.160
I think that if we want to discover the full potential

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
in our humanity,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.160
we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
and those glorious disabilities that we all have.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
I think of Shakespeare's Shylock:

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.160
"If you prick us, do we not bleed,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
and if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
It is our humanity,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
and all the potential within it,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
that makes us beautiful.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.160
Thank you.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:52.160
(Applause)
