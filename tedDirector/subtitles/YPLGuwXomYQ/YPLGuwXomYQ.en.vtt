00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I have a very difficult task.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
I'm a spectroscopist.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
I have to talk about astronomy without showing you

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.330
any single image of nebulae or galaxies, etc.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
because my job is spectroscopy.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
I never deal with images.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
But I'll try to convince you

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
that spectroscopy is actually something which can

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
change this world.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
Spectroscopy can probably answer the question,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.330
"Is there anybody out there?"

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
Are we alone? SETI.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
It's not very fun to do spectroscopy.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
One of my colleagues in Bulgaria,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
Nevena Markova, spent about 20 years

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
studying these profiles.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
And she published 42 articles

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
just dedicated to the subject.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
Can you imagine? Day and night, thinking,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
observing, the same star for 20 years

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
is incredible.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
But we are crazy. We do these things.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
(Laughter)

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
And I'm not that far.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
I spent about eight months working on these profiles.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
Because I've noticed

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
a very small symmetry

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
in the profile of one of the planet host stars.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.330
And I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
which is an indication that this star

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
has swallowed a planet.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.330
of Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
But you have it in planets and asteroids.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.330
So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
you will have this Lithium-6 isotope

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
in the spectrum of the star.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.330
So I invested more than eight months

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
just studying the profile of this star.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
And actually it's amazing,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
because I got phone calls from many reporters asking,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
"Have you actually seen the planet going into a star?"

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.330
Because they thought that if you are having a telescope,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
you are an astronomer so what you are doing

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
is actually looking in a telescope.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.330
And you might have seen the planet going into a star.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
And I was saying, "No, excuse me.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
What I see is this one."

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.330
(Laughter)

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
It's just incredible. Because nobody understood really.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
I bet that there were very few people

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330
who really understood what I'm talking about.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.330
Because this is the indication that the planet went into the star.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
It's amazing.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
The power of spectroscopy

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
was actually realized

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.330
by Pink Floyd already in 1973.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.330
(Laughter)

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
Because they actually said that

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
you can get any color you like

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
in a spectrum.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
And all you need is time and money

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
to make your spectrograph.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
This is the number one high resolution,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
most precise spectrograph on this planet, called HARPS,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
which is actually used to detect

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
extrasolar planets and sound waves

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
in the atmospheres of stars.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
How we get spectra?

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
I'm sure most of you know from school physics

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.330
that it's basically splitting a white light

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
into colors.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
And if you have a liquid hot mass,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.330
it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
A hot gas is producing emission lines only,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
no continuum.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.330
And if you place a cool gas in front of a

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
hot source,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
you will see certain patterns

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
which we call absorption lines.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
Which is used actually to identify chemical elements

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
in a cool matter,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
Now, what we can do with the spectra?

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
We can actually study line-of-sight velocities

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
of cosmic objects.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.330
And we can also study chemical composition

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
and physical parameters of stars,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
galaxies, nebulae.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
A star is the most simple object.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.330
In the core, we have thermonuclear reactions going on,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
creating chemical elements.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
And we have a cool atmosphere.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
It's cool for me.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.330
Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
My colleagues in infra-red astronomy

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.330
call minus 200 Kelvin is cool for them.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
But you know, everything is relative.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
So for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.330
(Laughter)

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
This is the spectrum of the Sun --

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
24,000 spectral lines,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.330
and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
It is amazing. So we are in the 21st century,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
and we still cannot properly understand

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
the spectrum of the sun.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
Sometimes we have to deal with

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
just one tiny, weak spectral line

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.330
to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
For instance, you see the spectral line of the gold

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
And we use this weak feature

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
to measure the composition

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
And now this is a work in progress.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.330
We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
which belongs to osmium.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.330
It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
explosions of supernovae.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
It's the only place where you can produce, actually, osmium.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.330
Just comparing the composition of osmium

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
in one of the planet host stars,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
we want to understand why there is so much

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
of this element.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
Perhaps we even think that maybe

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.330
supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
It can be an indication.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
The other day, my colleague from Berkeley,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
Gibor Basri, emailed me

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
a very interesting spectrum,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
asking me, "Can you have a look at this?"

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.330
And I couldn't sleep, next two weeks,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
when I saw the huge amount of oxygen

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
and other elements in the spectrum of the stars.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.330
I knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.330
It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
in this system, which polluted the atmosphere

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
of this star.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
And later a black hole was formed

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
in a binary system,

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
which is still there with a mass of about

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
five solar masses.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.330
come from supernovae explosions.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
My colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.330
in different galactic stars,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.330
actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
It's amazing that you can go so far

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.330
simply studying the chemical composition of stars.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.330
is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
There is interaction of galaxies. We know this.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:11.330
And sometimes they just capture stars.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
You've heard about solar flares.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
We were very surprised to discover

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
a super flare,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.330
a flare which is thousands of millions of times

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
more powerful than those we see in the Sun.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
In one of the binary stars in our galaxy

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
called FH Leo,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.330
we discovered the super flare.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.330
And later we went to study the spectral stars

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
to see is there anything strange with these objects.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
And we found that everything is normal.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
These stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.330
So this is a mystery.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
It's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
And there are six or seven similar cases

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
reported in the literature.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
Now to go ahead with this,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.330
we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
It's very complicated. I don't really want you to

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.330
try to understand what is here.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.330
(Laughter)

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
But it's to show you how complicated is the whole story

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
of the production of chemical elements.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
You have two channels --

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
the massive stars and low-mass stars --

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
And doing this for 14 billion years,

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
we end up with this picture,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
which is a very important graph,

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
showing relative abundances of chemical elements

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
in sun-like stars

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
and in the interstellar medium.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
So which means that it's really impossible

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.330
to find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.330
five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
And if you find one, I will say that

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
this is something related to SETI,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.330
because naturally you can't do it.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
Doppler Effect is something very important

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
from fundamental physics.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.330
And this is related to the change of the frequency

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.330
of a moving source.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:06.330
The Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
The precision which we need

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
to discover a Jupiter-like planet

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
around a sun-like star

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.330
is something like 28.4 meters per second.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
And we need nine centimeters per second

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.330
to detect an Earth-like planet.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
This can be done with the future spectrographs.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.330
I, myself, I'm actually involved in the team

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
which is developing a CODEX,

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
high resolution, future generation spectrograph

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.330
for the 42 meter E-ELT telescope.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
And this is going to be an instrument

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
to detect Earth-like planets

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
around sun-like stars.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.330
It is an amazing tool called astroseismology

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.330
where we can detect sound waves

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
in the atmospheres of stars.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
This is the sound of an Alpha Cen.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
We can detect sound waves

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
Those waves have frequencies

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.330
in infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
Coming back to the most important question,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
"Is there anybody out there?"

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
This is closely related

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.330
to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.330
Connection between life

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.330
and radioactive nuclei

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
is straightforward.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.330
No life without tectonic activity,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.330
without volcanic activity.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
And we know very well that geothermal energy

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:33.330
is mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.330
How to measure, if we have planets

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.330
where the amount of those elements is small,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.330
so those planets are tectonically dead,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
there cannot be life.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
probably, again, there would be no life.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.330
Because can you imagine everything boiling?

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
It's too much energy on a planet.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.330
Now, we have been measuring abundance

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.330
of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.330
It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
We are actually trying to measure this profile

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
and to detect thorium.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
It's very tough. It's very tough.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
And you have to, first you have to convince yourself.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
Then you have to convince your colleagues.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.330
And then you have to convince the whole world

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.330
that you have actually detected something like this

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.330
host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
It's really difficult.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:34.330
But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
you have to do this job.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
Because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
in those systems.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.330
The one way to discover about aliens

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.330
is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.330
If you receive something interesting,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
well that's what SETI does actually,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.330
what SETI has been doing for many years.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
I think the most promising way

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.330
is to go for biomarkers.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.330
You can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum,

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
and that is a very clear signal.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.330
The slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.330
is a detection of vegetated area.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.330
It's amazing that we can detect vegetation

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.330
from a spectrum.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
Now imagine doing this test

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.330
for other planets.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.330
Now very recently, very recently,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
I'm talking about last six, seven, eight months,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.330
water, methane, carbon dioxide

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
have been detected in the spectrum

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.330
of a planet outside the solar system.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.330
It's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.330
You can actually go and detect

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.330
and study a chemical composition of planets

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
far, far, far from solar system.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
We have to detect oxygen or ozone

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
to make sure that we have all necessary conditions

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.330
to have life.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
Cosmic miracles are something

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
which can be related to SETI.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
Now imagine an object, amazing object,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
or something which we cannot explain

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
when we just stand up and say,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work."

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.330
So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:23.330
"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow."

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
And with the known physics etc,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.330
it's something actually which has been pointed out

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
by Frank Drake,

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
many years ago, and Shklovsky.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
If you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.330
if you see strange chemical elements,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.330
it can be a signal from a civilization

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.330
which is there and they want to signal about it.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.330
They want to actually signal their presence

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.330
through these spectral lines,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
in the spectrum of a star, in different ways.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.330
There can be different ways doing this.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
One is, for instance, technetium

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
is a radioactive element

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.330
with a decay time of 4.2 million years.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.330
If you suddenly observe technetium

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.330
in a sun-like star,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
you can be sure that somebody has put this

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
element in the atmosphere,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:15.330
because in a natural way it is impossible to do this.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
Now we are reviewing the spectra of about

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
300 stars with extrasolar planets.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.330
And we are doing this job since 2000

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
and it's a very heavy project.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
We have been working very hard.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.330
And we have some interesting cases,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.330
candidates, so on, things which we can't really explain.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
And I hope in the near future

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.330
we can confirm this.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
So the main question: "Are we alone?"

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
I think it will not come from UFOs.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.330
It will not come from radio signals.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.330
I think it will come from a spectrum like this.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:01.330
It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.330
as a clear signal of life,

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.330
and oxygen and ozone.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.330
If, one day, and I think it will be

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
within 15 years from now, or 20 years.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.330
If we discover a spectrum like this

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.330
we can be sure that there is life on that planet.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.330
In about five years we will discover

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.330
planets like Earth, around sun-like stars,

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.330
the same distance as the Earth from the Sun.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.330
It will take about five years.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.330
And then we will need another 10, 15 years

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.330
with space projects

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.330
to get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.330
And if we see the nitrogen dioxide

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.330
and oxygen,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.330
I think we have the perfect E.T.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.330
Thank you very much.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:49.330
(Applause)
