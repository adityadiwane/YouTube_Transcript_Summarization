00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
So, a big question that we're facing now

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
and have been for quite a number of years now:

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
are we at risk of a nuclear attack?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
Now, there's a bigger question

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
that's probably actually more important than that,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.160
is the notion of permanently eliminating

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
the possibility of a nuclear attack,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
eliminating the threat altogether.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
And I would like to make a case to you that

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
until this very moment,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
that's characterized by two phases,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
which I'm going to go through with you right now.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.160
First of all, we started off the nuclear age in 1945.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
through the Manhattan Project,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
and the idea was very straightforward:

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
we would use the power of the atom

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
to end the atrocities and the horror

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
of this unending World War II

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
that we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
And in 1945,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
we were the only nuclear power.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
We had a few nuclear weapons,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
two of which we dropped on Japan, in Hiroshima,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
a few days later in Nagasaki, in August 1945,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
killing about 250,000 people between those two.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
And for a few years,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
we were the only nuclear power on Earth.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
But by 1949, the Soviet Union had decided

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
and they began to match what the United States had developed.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
And from 1949 to 1985

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
was an extraordinary time

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
that no one could possibly have imagined

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
back in the 1940s.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
So by 1985 -- each of those red bombs up here

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
is equivalent of a thousands warheads --

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
the world had

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
65,000 nuclear warheads,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
and seven members of something

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
that came to be known as the "nuclear club."

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
And it was an extraordinary time,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
and I am going to go through some of the mentality

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
that we -- that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
of the nuclear weapons at any particular time

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
since 1985 -- going forward, of course --

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
were part of the arsenals

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
of the United States and the Soviet Union.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
After 1985, and before the break up of the Soviet Union,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
we began to disarm

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
from a nuclear point of view.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
We began to counter-proliferate,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
to about a total of 21,000.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.160
It's a very difficult number to deal with,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
because what we've done is

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
we've quote unquote "decommissioned" some of the warheads.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
They're still probably usable. They could be "re-commissioned,"

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
but the way they count things, which is very complicated,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
we think we have about a third

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
of the nuclear weapons we had before.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
But we also, in that period of time,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
added two more members to the nuclear club:

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
Pakistan and North Korea.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
among many countries around the world,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
but a very different set of circumstances.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
So I'm going to talk about

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
a nuclear threat story in two chapters.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
Chapter one is 1949 to 1991,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
when the Soviet Union broke up,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
and what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
was a superpowers' nuclear arms race.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
It was characterized by

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
a nation-versus-nation,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
very fragile standoff.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
And basically,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
we lived for all those years,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
and some might argue that we still do,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
in a situation of

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
being on the brink, literally,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.160
of an apocalyptic, planetary calamity.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
It's incredible that we actually lived through all that.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
We were totally dependent during those years

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
on this amazing acronym, which is MAD.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
It stands for mutually assured destruction.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
So it meant

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
if you attacked us, we would attack you

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
virtually simultaneously,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
and the end result would be a destruction

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
of your country and mine.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
So the threat of my own destruction

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
kept me from launching

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.160
a nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
And the danger of that, of course, is that

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
a misreading of a radar screen

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
could actually cause a counter-launch,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
even though the first country had not actually launched anything.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
During this chapter one,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.160
there was a high level of public awareness

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
about the potential of nuclear catastrophe,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
and an indelible image was implanted

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
in our collective minds

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
that, in fact, a nuclear holocaust

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
would be absolutely globally destructive

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
and could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
So this was chapter one.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
Now the odd thing is that even though

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
we knew that there would be

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
that kind of civilization obliteration,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
we engaged in America in a series --

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
and in fact, in the Soviet Union --

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
in a series of response planning.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
It was absolutely incredible.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
So premise one is we'd be destroying the world,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
and then premise two is, why don't we get prepared for it?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
So what

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
we offered ourselves

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
just to jog your memories.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
If you're born after 1950, this is just --

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
consider this entertainment, otherwise it's memory lane.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
This was Bert the Turtle. (Video)

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
This was basically an attempt

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
to teach our schoolchildren

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
that if we did get engaged

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
then we wanted our school children

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
to kind of basically duck and cover.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
That was the principle. You --

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
there would be a nuclear conflagration

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
about to hit us, and if you get under your desk,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
things would be OK.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
(Laughter)

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
I didn't do all that well

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
in psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
and I think this was seriously delusional.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
(Laughter)

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
Secondly, we told people

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
to go down in their basements

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
and build a fallout shelter.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
Maybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
or you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
a very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
And actually -- so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
Or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
that you could simply bury in the ground.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
Now, the bomb shelters at that point --

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
let's say you bought a prefab one -- it would be a few hundred dollars,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
maybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
Yet, what percentage of Americans

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house?

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
What percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter?

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
Less than two percent. About 1.4 percent

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
of the population, as far as anyone knows,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
did anything,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
either making a space in their basement

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
or actually building a bomb shelter.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
Many buildings, public buildings, around the country --

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
this is New York City -- had these little civil defense signs,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
and the idea was that you would

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
run into one of these shelters and be safe

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
from the nuclear weaponry.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
And one of the greatest governmental delusions

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
of all time was something that happened

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
in the early days of

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
Here is their first big public

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
announcement.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
They would propose --

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
actually there were about six volumes written on this --

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
a crisis relocation plan

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.160
that was dependent upon

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
the United States having three to four days warning

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
that the Soviets were going to attack us.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
So the goal was to evacuate the target cities.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
We would move people out of the target cities

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
into the countryside.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
And I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
about the absolute ludicrous idea

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160
that we would actually evacuate,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
and actually have three or four days' warning.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
It was just completely off the wall.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
Turns out that they had another idea

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
behind it, even though this was --

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
they were telling the public it was to save us.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
The idea was that we would force the Soviets

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
to re-target their nuclear weapons -- very expensive --

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
and potentially double their arsenal,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.160
to not only take out the original site,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
but take out sites where people were going.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160
This was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
It was just really, really frightening.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
The main point here is we were dealing with

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
a complete disconnect from reality.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
The civil defense programs were disconnected

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
from the reality of what we'd see in all-out nuclear war.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.160
So organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
around 1979, started saying this a lot publicly.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
They would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
and they'd say, "Here's a map of your city.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.160
Here's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit."

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
So no possibility of medical response to,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
or meaningful preparedness for

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
all-out nuclear war.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
So we had to prevent nuclear war

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
if we expected to survive.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
This disconnect was never actually resolved.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
And what happened was --

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
when we get in to chapter two

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
of the nuclear threat era,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
which started back in 1945.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
Chapter two starts in 1991.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
When the Soviet Union broke up,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
we effectively lost that adversary

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
as a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
It's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
But from 1991

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
through the present time,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
emphasized by the attacks of 2001,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
the idea of an all-out nuclear war

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
has diminished and the idea of a single event,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
act of nuclear terrorism

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
is what we have instead.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
Although the scenario has changed

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.160
very considerably, the fact is

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
that we haven't changed our mental image

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
of what a nuclear war means.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
So I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
So, what is a nuclear terror threat?

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
And there's four key ingredients to describing that.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
First thing is that the global nuclear weapons,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
happen to be not uniformly secure.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
And it's particularly not secure

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.160
in the former Soviet Union, now in Russia.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160
There are many, many sites where warheads are stored

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
and, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
like highly enriched uranium and plutonium,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
are absolutely not safe.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160
They're available to be bought, stolen, whatever.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
They're acquirable, let me put it that way.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
From 1993 through 2006,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
the International Atomic Energy Agency

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.160
documented 175 cases of nuclear theft,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.160
18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.160
the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
is about 1,300, at the low end,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
to about 2,100 metric tons.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
More than 100 megatons of this

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
is stored in particularly insecure

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
Russian facilities.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
How much of that do you think it would take

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb?

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.160
Well, you need about 75 pounds of it.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
So, what I'd like to show you

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
is

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
what it would take to hold 75 pounds

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160
of highly enriched uranium.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.160
This is not a product placement. It's just --

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.160
in fact, if I was Coca Cola, I'd be pretty distressed about this --

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.160
(Laughter)

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.160
-- but

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
basically, this is it.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
This is what you would need to steal or buy

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
out of that 100-metric-ton stockpile

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
that's relatively insecure

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
to create the type of bomb

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
that was used in Hiroshima.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
Now you might want to look at plutonium

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.160
That -- you'd need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
Now, plutonium, 10 to 13 pounds:

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.160
this. This is enough plutonium

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.160
to create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160
Now this situation, already I --

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
you know, I don't really like thinking about this,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
although somehow I got myself a job

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
where I have to think about it. So

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
the point is that we're very, very insecure

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
in terms of developing this material.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160
The second thing is, what about the know-how?

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
And there's a lot of controversy about

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
whether terror organizations have the know-how

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.160
to actually make a nuclear weapon.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
Well, there's a lot of know-how out there.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.160
There's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
There's detailed information on how to assemble

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
a nuclear weapon from parts.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
There's books about how to build a nuclear bomb.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
There are plans for how to create a terror farm

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.160
where you could actually manufacture and develop

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
all the components and assemble it.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.160
All of this information is relatively available.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
If you have an undergraduate degree in physics,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
I would suggest --

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
although I don't, so maybe it's not even true --

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
but something close to that would allow you,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
with the information that's currently available,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
to actually build a nuclear weapon.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.160
The third element of the nuclear terror threat

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
is that, who would actually do such a thing?

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
Well, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
that involves individuals who are highly organized.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
They are very dedicated and committed.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160
They are stateless.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.160
Somebody once said, Al Qaeda

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.160
does not have a return address,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
what's the response, and to whom is the response?

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
And they're retaliation-proof.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
Since there is no real retribution possible

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.160
that would make any difference,

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.160
since there are people willing to actually give up their lives

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
in order to do a lot of damage to us,

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.160
it becomes apparent

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.160
that the whole notion

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
of this mutually assured destruction would not work.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
Here is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
and Sulaiman was a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
He wrote many, many times statements to this effect:

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160
"we have the right to kill four million Americans,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
two million of whom should be children."

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
And we don't have to go overseas

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
to find people willing to do harm, for whatever their reasons.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160
McVeigh and Nichols, and the Oklahoma City attack

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
in the 1990s

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
was a good example of homegrown terrorists.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
What if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon?

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160
The fourth element

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
is that the high-value U.S. targets

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
are accessible, soft and plentiful.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.160
This would be a talk for another day, but the level of the preparedness

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160
that the United States has achieved

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
since 9/11 of '01

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
is unbelievably inadequate.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
What you saw after Katrina

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160
is a very good indicator

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
of how little prepared the United States is

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
for any kind of major attack.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
Seven million ship cargo containers

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
come into the United States every year.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
Five to seven percent only are inspected --

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
five to seven percent.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
This is Alexander Lebed,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
who was a general that worked with Yeltsin,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
who talked about, and presented to Congress,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
this idea that the Russians had developed --

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
these suitcase bombs. They were very low yield --

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
0.1 to one kiloton,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
Hiroshima was around 13 kilotons --

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.160
but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
And Lebed came to the United States

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
and told us that many, many --

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
more than 80 of the suitcase bombs

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
were actually not accountable.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
And they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
You put the elements into a suitcase.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.160
It becomes very portable.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
The suitcase can be conveniently dropped

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
in your trunk of your car.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
You take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.160
You don't want to build a suitcase bomb,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.160
and you happen to get one of those insecure

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
nuclear warheads that exist.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
This is the size of

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
the "Little Boy" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
It was 9.8 feet long,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.160
weighed 8,800 pounds. You go down to

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.160
your local rent-a-truck

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
and for 50 bucks or so,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
you rent a truck that's got the right capacity,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
and you take your bomb,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
you put it in the truck and you're ready to go.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160
It could happen. But what it would mean and who would survive?

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
but what I'm trying to say is that

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
we have all the elements of that happening.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160
Anybody who dismisses the thought

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.160
of a nuclear weapon

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community --

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160
a lot of people who deal with this work in general

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.160
think it's almost inevitable, unless we do certain things

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.160
to really try to defuse the risk,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160
like better interdiction, better prevention,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.160
better fixing, you know, better screening

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.160
of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.160
There's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
At this particular moment,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.160
we actually could end up

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.160
seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.160
I don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.160
any time soon, although even that is not completely off the table.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160
There's still enough nuclear weapons

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.160
in the arsenals of the superpowers

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160
to destroy the Earth many, many times over.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.160
There are flash points in India and Pakistan,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.160
in the Middle East, in North Korea,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.160
other places where the use of nuclear weapons,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.160
while initially locally,

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160
could very rapidly

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
go into a situation

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.160
where we'd be facing all-out nuclear war.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.160
It's very unsettling.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160
Here we go. OK.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.160
I'm back in my truck, and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
We're coming down,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.160
and we bring that truck

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
that you just saw

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.160
somewhere in here, in the Financial District.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.160
This is a 10-kiloton bomb,

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.160
slightly smaller than was used

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.160
in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.160
by just giving you some information. I think --

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.160
"news you could use" kind of concept here.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.160
So, first of all, this would be horrific

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.160
beyond anything we can possibly imagine.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.160
This is the ultimate.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.160
And if you're in the half-mile radius

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.160
of where this bomb went off,

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.160
you have a 90 percent chance of not making it.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.160
If you're right where the bomb went off,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.160
you will be vaporized. And that's --

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.160
I'm just telling you, this is not good.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.160
(Laughter)

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.160
You assume that.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160
Two-mile radius, you have a 50 percent chance

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.160
of being killed,

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.160
and up to about eight miles away --

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
now I'm talking about killed instantly --

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.160
somewhere between a 10 and 20 percent

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.160
chance of getting killed.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.160
The thing about this is that

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.160
the experience of the nuclear detonation is --

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.160
first of all, tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.160
at the core here, where it goes off,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.160
and an extraordinary amount of energy

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.160
in the form of heat, acute radiation

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.160
and blast effects.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.160
An enormous hurricane-like wind,

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.160
and destruction of buildings almost totally,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.160
within this yellow circle here.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.160
And what I'm going to focus on, as I come to conclusion here,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.160
is that, what happens to you

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.160
if you're in here?

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.160
Well, if we're talking about the old days

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
of an all-out nuclear attack,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.160
you, up here,

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.160
are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.160
My point now, though, is that there is a lot

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.160
that we could do for you who are in here,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.160
if you've survived the initial blast.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.160
You have, when the blast goes off --

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.160
and by the way, if it ever comes up, don't look at it.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.160
(Laughter)

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.160
If you look at it, you're going to be blind,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.160
either temporarily or permanently.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.160
So if there's any way that you can avoid,

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.160
like, avert your eyes, that would be a good thing.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.160
If you find yourself alive, but

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.160
you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon,

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.160
you have -- that's gone off --

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.160
you have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.160
and exactly where it went off,

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.160
to get out of the way before

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.160
a lethal amount of radiation

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.160
comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.160
In that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do --

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.160
and I mean this seriously --

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.160
is go about a mile

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.160
away from the blast.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.160
And what happens is -- this is --

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.160
I'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within 20 minutes,

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.160
it comes straight down. Within 24 hours,

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.160
lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.160
and it's mostly in this particular direction --

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.160
it's going northeast.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.160
And if you're in this vicinity, you've got to get away.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.160
So you're feeling the wind --

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.160
and there's tremendous wind now

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.160
that you're going to be feeling -- and you want to go

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.160
perpendicular to the wind

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.160
[not upwind or downwind].

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.160
if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.160
You've got to get out of there.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.160
If you don't get out of there, you're going to be exposed

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.160
to lethal radiation in very short order.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.160
If you can't get out of there,

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.160
we want you to go into a shelter and stay there.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.160
Now, in a shelter in an urban area means

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.160
you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible,

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.160
or you have to be on a floor -- on a high floor --

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.160
if it's a ground burst explosion, which it would be,

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.160
higher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher,

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.160
or in the basement.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.160
But basically, you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.160
And if you do that,

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.160
you actually can survive a nuclear blast.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.160
Over the next few days to a week,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.160
there will be a radiation cloud,

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.160
again, going with the wind, and settling down

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.160
for another 15 or 20 miles out --

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.160
in this case, over Long Island.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.160
And if you're in the direct fallout zone here,

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.160
you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there,

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.160
and that's clear. But if you are sheltered,

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.160
you can actually survive.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.160
The difference between knowing information

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.160
of what you're going to do personally,

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.160
and not knowing information, can save your life,

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.160
and it could mean the difference between

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.160
150,000 to 200,000 fatalities

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.160
from something like this

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.160
and half a million to 700,000 fatalities.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.160
So, response planning in the twenty-first century

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.160
is both possible and is essential.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.160
But in 2008, there isn't one single American city

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.160
that has done effective plans

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.160
to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.160
Part of the problem is that

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.160
the emergency planners themselves, personally,

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.160
are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.160
of nuclear catastrophe.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.160
They are paralyzed.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.160
You say "nuclear" to them, and they're thinking,

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.160
"Oh my God, we're all gone. What's the point? It's futile."

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.160
And we're trying to tell them, "It's not futile.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.160
We can change the survival rates

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.160
by doing some commonsensical things."

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.160
So the goal here is to minimize fatalities.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.160
And I just want to leave you with the personal points

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.160
that I think you might be interested in.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.160
The key to surviving a nuclear blast

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.160
is getting out,

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.160
and not going into harm's way.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.160
That's basically all we're going to be talking about here.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.160
And the farther you are away in distance,

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.160
the longer it is in time

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.160
from the initial blast;

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.160
and the more separation between you

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.160
and the outside atmosphere, the better.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.160
So separation -- hopefully with dirt or concrete,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.160
or being in a basement --

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.160
distance and time is what will save you.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.160
So here's what you do. First of all,

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.160
as I said, don't stare at the light flash,

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.160
if you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.160
But let's assume, theoretically, you want to do that.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.160
You want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.160
don't burst from the pressures.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.160
If you're very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover,

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.160
like Bert told you, Bert the Turtle.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.160
And you want to get under something so that you're not injured

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.160
or killed by objects, if that's at all possible.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.160
You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud,

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.160
I said, in just a few minutes.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.160
And shelter and place. You want to move [only]

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.160
crosswind for 1.2 miles.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.160
You know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.160
and down in that direction,

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.160
less destroyed here,

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.160
then you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.160
as long as you're going crosswise to the wind.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.160
Once you're out and evacuating,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.160
you want to keep as much of your skin,

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.160
your mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.160
doesn't impede you moving and getting out of there.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.160
And finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.160
And if you're wearing clothing, you've taken off your clothing,

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.160
you're going to get showered down some place

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.160
and remove the radiation that would be --

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.160
the radioactive material that might be on you.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.160
And then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.160
but you're going to wait hopefully -- you'll have your little wind-up,

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.160
battery-less radio,

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.160
and you'll be waiting for people to tell you

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.160
when it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.160
In conclusion,

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.160
nuclear war is less likely than before,

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.160
but by no means out of the question, and it's not survivable.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.160
Nuclear terrorism is possible -- it may be probable --

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.160
but is survivable.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.160
And this is Jack Geiger, who's one of the heroes

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.160
of the U.S. public health community.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.160
And Jack said the only way to deal

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.160
with nuclear anything,

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.160
whether it's war or terrorism,

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.160
is abolition of nuclear weapons.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.160
And you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming,

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.160
I urge you to think about the fact that

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.160
we have to do something about this

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.160
unacceptable, inhumane

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.160
reality of nuclear weapons

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.160
in our world.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.160
Now, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and I --

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.160
(Laughter)

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.160
-- I don't want to be indelicate, but

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.160
this --

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.160
he's no longer in office. We don't really care, OK.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.160
This was sent to me by somebody

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.160
who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures,

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.160
but the fact of the matter is that

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.160
America's gone through a very hard time.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.160
We've not been focused, we've not done what we had to do,

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.160
and now we're facing the potential of

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.160
bad, hell on Earth.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.160
Thank you.
