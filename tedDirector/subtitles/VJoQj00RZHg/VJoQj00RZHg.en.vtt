00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:15.507
I could never have imagined

00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:19.483
that a 19-year-old suicide bomber

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:23.188
would actually teach me a valuable lesson.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.807
But he did.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.259
He taught me to never presume anything

00:00:31.283 --> 00:00:34.423
about anyone you don't know.

00:00:36.414 --> 00:00:40.543
On a Thursday morning in July 2005,

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:43.625
the bomber and I, unknowingly,

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.196
boarded the same train carriage
at the same time,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.683
standing, apparently, just feet apart.

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:55.495
I didn't see him.

00:00:56.185 --> 00:00:57.976
Actually, I didn't see anyone.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.587
You know not to look
at anyone on the Tube,

00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:03.912
but I guess he saw me.

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:07.957
I guess he looked at all of us,

00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:12.901
as his hand hovered
over the detonation switch.

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.884
I've often wondered: What was he thinking?

00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:22.265
Especially in those final seconds.

00:01:24.765 --> 00:01:26.374
I know it wasn't personal.

00:01:26.977 --> 00:01:30.994
He didn't set out to kill
or maim me, Gill Hicks.

00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:32.771
I mean -- he didn't know me.

00:01:33.758 --> 00:01:34.932
No.

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:38.612
Instead, he gave me

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:43.241
an unwarranted and an unwanted label.

00:01:44.272 --> 00:01:47.652
I had become the enemy.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.966
To him, I was the "other,"

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.687
the "them," as opposed to "us."

00:01:57.581 --> 00:02:02.855
The label "enemy" allowed him
to dehumanize us.

00:02:03.674 --> 00:02:06.101
It allowed him to push that button.

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:09.506
And he wasn't selective.

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:16.058
Twenty-six precious lives were taken
in my carriage alone,

00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:18.970
and I was almost one of them.

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:23.596
In the time it takes to draw a breath,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.290
we were plunged into a darkness so immense

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:29.696
that it was almost tangible;

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.079
what I imagine wading
through tar might be like.

00:02:35.398 --> 00:02:37.448
We didn't know we were the enemy.

00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:42.379
We were just a bunch of commuters
who, minutes earlier,

00:02:42.403 --> 00:02:44.887
had followed the Tube etiquette:

00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:47.117
no direct eye contact,

00:02:47.141 --> 00:02:48.291
no talking

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:51.766
and absolutely no conversation.

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:56.901
But in the lifting of the darkness,

00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:59.401
we were reaching out.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.691
We were helping each other.

00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:05.269
We were calling out our names,

00:03:05.293 --> 00:03:07.444
a little bit like a roll call,

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.666
waiting for responses.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.222
"I'm Gill. I'm here.

00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:18.421
I'm alive.

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:21.468
OK."

00:03:23.697 --> 00:03:24.883
"I'm Gill.

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:26.875
Here.

00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:29.627
Alive.

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.524
OK."

00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:37.637
I didn't know Alison.

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:42.641
But I listened for her check-ins
every few minutes.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.958
I didn't know Richard.

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.728
But it mattered to me that he survived.

00:03:50.752 --> 00:03:52.546
All I shared with them

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.053
was my first name.

00:03:55.013 --> 00:03:56.164
They didn't know

00:03:56.188 --> 00:03:59.711
that I was a head of a department
at the Design Council.

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:04.742
And here is my beloved briefcase,

00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:07.217
also rescued from that morning.

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:12.445
They didn't know that I published
architecture and design journals,

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.785
that I was a Fellow
of the Royal Society of Arts,

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:17.274
that I wore black --

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:19.861
still do --

00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:23.122
that I smoked cigarillos.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.191
I don't smoke cigarillos anymore.

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:30.399
I drank gin and I watched TED Talks,

00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:36.629
of course, never dreaming
that one day I would be standing,

00:04:37.593 --> 00:04:40.488
balancing on prosthetic legs,

00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:41.669
giving a talk.

00:04:42.651 --> 00:04:48.295
I was a young Australian woman
doing extraordinary things in London.

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.152
And I wasn't ready for that all to end.

00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:56.040
I was so determined to survive

00:04:56.064 --> 00:05:01.266
that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets
around the tops of my legs,

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.623
and I just shut everything
and everyone out,

00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:10.605
to focus, to listen to myself,

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:13.763
to be guided by instinct alone.

00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:17.179
I lowered my breathing rate.

00:05:17.847 --> 00:05:19.627
I elevated my thighs.

00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:21.319
I held myself upright

00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:25.013
and I fought the urge to close my eyes.

00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:30.013
I held on for almost an hour,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.411
an hour to contemplate
the whole of my life

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.231
up until this point.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.278
Perhaps I should have done more.

00:05:43.223 --> 00:05:46.427
Perhaps I could have
lived more, seen more.

00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:50.865
Maybe I should have gone running,
dancing, taken up yoga.

00:05:52.317 --> 00:05:57.255
But my priority and my focus
was always my work.

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.180
I lived to work.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.537
Who I was on my business card

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:03.831
mattered to me.

00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:09.298
But it didn't matter down in that tunnel.

00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:15.696
By the time I felt that first touch

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.860
from one of my rescuers,

00:06:18.472 --> 00:06:20.589
I was unable to speak,

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:25.592
unable to say even
a small word, like "Gill."

00:06:27.183 --> 00:06:29.918
I surrendered my body to them.

00:06:29.942 --> 00:06:32.815
I had done all I possibly could,

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:36.535
and now I was in their hands.

00:06:39.091 --> 00:06:40.479
I understood

00:06:41.283 --> 00:06:47.481
just who and what humanity really is,

00:06:47.972 --> 00:06:51.171
when I first saw the ID tag

00:06:51.195 --> 00:06:54.454
that was given to me
when I was admitted to hospital.

00:06:54.478 --> 00:06:55.652
And it read:

00:06:56.218 --> 00:07:01.488
"One unknown estimated female."

00:07:03.162 --> 00:07:07.377
One unknown estimated female.

00:07:09.004 --> 00:07:11.951
Those four words were my gift.

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:15.872
What they told me very clearly

00:07:15.896 --> 00:07:18.601
was that my life was saved,

00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:21.769
purely because I was a human being.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.794
Difference of any kind made no difference

00:07:26.818 --> 00:07:31.375
to the extraordinary lengths
that the rescuers were prepared to go

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:33.669
to save my life,

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:37.181
to save as many unknowns as they could,

00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:39.537
and putting their own lives at risk.

00:07:40.405 --> 00:07:44.576
To them, it didn't matter
if I was rich or poor,

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.439
the color of my skin,

00:07:47.463 --> 00:07:49.025
whether I was male or female,

00:07:49.049 --> 00:07:50.946
my sexual orientation,

00:07:51.613 --> 00:07:53.216
who I voted for,

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.758
whether I was educated,

00:07:54.782 --> 00:07:58.471
if I had a faith or no faith at all.

00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:01.353
Nothing mattered

00:08:01.377 --> 00:08:06.020
other than I was a precious human life.

00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:11.361
I see myself as a living fact.

00:08:12.223 --> 00:08:14.252
I am proof

00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:21.004
that unconditional love and respect
can not only save,

00:08:21.028 --> 00:08:24.069
but it can transform lives.

00:08:25.226 --> 00:08:29.694
Here is a wonderful image
of one of my rescuers, Andy, and I

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.590
taken just last year.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.641
Ten years after the event,

00:08:34.665 --> 00:08:37.009
and here we are, arm in arm.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.677
Throughout all the chaos,

00:08:41.701 --> 00:08:44.541
my hand was held tightly.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.073
My face was stroked gently.

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:50.573
What did I feel?

00:08:51.541 --> 00:08:52.763
I felt loved.

00:08:53.685 --> 00:08:58.502
What's shielded me from hatred
and wanting retribution,

00:08:58.526 --> 00:09:01.515
what's given me the courage to say:

00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:04.419
this ends with me

00:09:06.006 --> 00:09:07.197
is love.

00:09:08.585 --> 00:09:10.583
I was loved.

00:09:13.234 --> 00:09:19.499
I believe the potential
for widespread positive change

00:09:19.523 --> 00:09:21.103
is absolutely enormous

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:24.031
because I know what we're capable of.

00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:27.252
I know the brilliance of humanity.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.840
So this leaves me with some
pretty big things to ponder

00:09:31.864 --> 00:09:35.266
and some questions for us all to consider:

00:09:36.512 --> 00:09:42.385
Is what unites us not far greater
than what can ever divide?

00:09:43.663 --> 00:09:47.453
Does it have to take
a tragedy or a disaster

00:09:47.477 --> 00:09:51.973
for us to feel deeply
connected as one species,

00:09:52.902 --> 00:09:54.761
as human beings?

00:09:55.755 --> 00:10:00.961
And when will we embrace
the wisdom of our era

00:10:01.764 --> 00:10:05.134
to rise above mere tolerance

00:10:05.931 --> 00:10:08.868
and move to an acceptance

00:10:08.892 --> 00:10:14.225
for all who are only a label
until we know them?

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.710
Thank you.

00:10:16.734 --> 00:10:23.532
(Applause)
