00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
These are grim economic times,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
fellow TEDsters, grim economic times indeed.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
And so, I would like to cheer you up

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
with one of the great, albeit largely unknown,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
commercial success stories

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
of the past 20 years.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
Comparable, in its own very peculiar way,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
to the achievements of Microsoft or Google.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
with equanimity.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
I refer to organized crime.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
Now organized crime has been around

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
for a very long time, I hear you say,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
and these would be wise words, indeed.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
But in the last two decades,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
it has experienced an unprecedented expansion,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.160
now accounting for roughly 15 percent

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
of the world's GDP.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
or McMafia, for short.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
So what triggered this extraordinary growth

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
in cross-border crime?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
Well, of course, there is globalization,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
technology, communications, all that stuff,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
which we'll talk about a little bit later.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
But first, I would like to take you back

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
to this event:

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
the collapse of communism.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.160
All across Eastern Europe, a most momentous episode

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
in our post-war history.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
Now it's time for full disclosure.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
This event meant a great deal to me personally.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.160
I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
like Solidarity in Poland,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
when I was in my teens.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.160
I then started writing about Eastern Europe,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
and eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
which is what I was doing in 1989.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.160
And so when 425 million people

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
finally won the right

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
to choose their own governments,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
I was ecstatic,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
but I was also a touch worried

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
about some of the nastier things

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
lurking behind the wall.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
It wasn't long, for example,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
before ethnic nationalism

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
reared its bloody head

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
in Yugoslavia.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
And amongst the chaos,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
amidst the euphoria,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
it took me a little while to understand

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
that some of the people who had wielded power

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.160
before 1989, in Eastern Europe,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.160
continued to do so after the revolutions there.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.160
Obviously there were characters like this.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.160
But there were also some more unexpected people

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.160
who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
Like this character. Remember these guys?

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
and wrestling, every four years in the Olympics,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
and they were the great celebrities of communism,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
They used to get great apartments in the center of town,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
casual sex on tap,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
and they could travel to the West very freely,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
which was a great luxury at the time.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.160
It may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
in the emergence of the market economy

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
in Eastern Europe.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
Or as I like to call them, they are

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
the midwives of capitalism.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
Here are some of those same weightlifters

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
after their 1989 makeover.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
Now in Bulgaria --

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
this photograph was taken in Bulgaria --

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
it wasn't just communism;

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
it was the state that collapsed as well.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
That means your police force wasn't working.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
The court system wasn't functioning properly.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
So what was a business man in the brave new world

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
of East European capitalism going to do

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.160
to make sure that his contracts would be honored?

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
Well, he would turn to people who were called, rather prosaically

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.160
by sociologists, privatized law enforcement agencies.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
We prefer to know them as the mafia.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
And in Bulgaria, the mafia was soon joined

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
with 14,000 people

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.160
who were sacked from their jobs in the security services

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
between 1989 and 1991.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.160
Now, when your state is collapsing,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
your economy is heading south at a rate of knots,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
the last people you want coming on to the labor market

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160
are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
are surveillance,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
are smuggling, building underground networks

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
and killing people.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
But that's what happened all over Eastern Europe.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Now, when I was working in the 1990s,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
I spent most of the time covering

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
And I couldn't help notice

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.160
that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
the paramilitary organizations,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
were actually the same people running

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
the organized criminal syndicates.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.160
And I came to think that behind the violence

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.160
lay a sinister criminal enterprise.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.160
And so I resolved to travel around the world

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
examining this global criminal underworld

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
by talking to policemen,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
by talking to victims, by talking to consumers

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
of illicit goods and services.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.160
But above all else, by talking to the gangsters themselves.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
Why? Well of course

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
there was the issue of law and order collapsing,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
but also, as they say in the retail trade,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.160
it's location, location, location.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
And what I noticed at the beginning of my research

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.160
that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.160
for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
Heroin, cocaine,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
women being trafficked into prostitution

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
and precious minerals.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
And where were they heading?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
The European Union, which by now

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.160
was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
transforming it into

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
the most affluent consumer market in history,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
eventually comprising some 500 million people.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
And a significant minority

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
of those 500 million people

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
sleeping with prostitutes,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160
sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
and employing illegal migrant laborers.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.160
Now, organized crime in a globalizing world

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
operates in the same way as any other business.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
It has zones of production,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
like Afghanistan and Columbia.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160
It has zones of distribution,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160
like Mexico and the Balkans.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.160
And then, of course, it has zones of consumption,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
like the European Union, Japan

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
and of course, the United States.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
The zones of production and distribution

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
tend to lie in the developing world,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.160
and they are often threatened by appalling violence

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
and bloodshed.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
Take Mexico, for example.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.160
Six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.160
as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo?

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.160
Since 1998, five million people have died there.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
It's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
but it's the biggest conflict on this planet

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
since the Second World War.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
And why is it? Because mafias from all around the world

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
cooperate with local paramilitaries

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
in order to seize the supplies

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
of the rich mineral resources

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
of the region.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.160
In the year 2000, 80 percent of the world's coltan

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
was sourced to the killing fields

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.160
of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.160
Now, coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.160
in almost every laptop

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.160
and games console.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
in exchange for weapons,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.160
and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
And it is this Western desire

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
to consume

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
that is the primary driver

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
of international organized crime.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.160
Now, let me show you some of my friends in action,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
caught conveniently on film by the Italian police,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.160
and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.160
Now, cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.160
The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
So if you can smuggle them into the E.U.,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
there are very handsome profits to be made,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
and I want to show you this to demonstrate

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
the type of resources available to these groups.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.160
This boat is worth one million Euros when it's new.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.160
And it's the fastest thing on European waters.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
From 1994, for seven years,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
20 of these boats

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
made the trip across the Adriatic,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
from Montenegro to Italy, every single night.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
And as a consequence of this trade,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.160
Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.160
And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.160
and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
Now Italian police, when this trade started,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.160
had just two boats which could go at the same speed.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
And this is very important, because the only way you can catch these guys

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
is if they run out of gas.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
women being trafficked into prostitution,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160
and if the police intervened, they would hurl

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.160
the women into the sea

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
so that the police had to go and save them from drowning,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.160
rather than chasing the bad guys.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160
So I have shown you this to demonstrate

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
how many boats, how many vessels it takes

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
to catch one of these guys.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
And the answer is six vessels.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
And remember, 20 of these speed boats

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
were coming across the Adriatic

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
every single night.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.160
So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making?

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.160
Well, this is where we come to globalization,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
because that was not just the deregulation of global trade.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.160
It was the liberalization of international financial markets.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
And boy, did that make it easy

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
for the money launderers.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
The last two decades have been the champagne era

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
for dirty lucre.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.160
In the 1990s, we saw financial centers around the world

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
competing for their business,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
and there was simply no effective mechanism

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
to prevent money laundering.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
And a lot of licit banks were also happy

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
to accept deposits

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
from very dubious sources

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
without questions being asked.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.160
But at the heart of this, is the offshore banking network.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160
Now these things

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
are an essential part of the money laundering parade,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.160
and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.160
and transnational organized crime, money laundering,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
you have to get rid of them.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160
On a positive note, we at last have someone in the White House

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.160
who has consistently spoken out

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
against these corrosive entities.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
And if anyone is concerned about what I believe

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
is the necessity for

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.160
new legislation, regulation, effective regulation,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.160
I say, let's take a look at Bernie Madoff,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.160
who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:04.160
Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
with the Colombian cartels

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
and the major Russian crime syndicates,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160
but he did this for decades

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
in the very heart of Wall Street,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
and no regulator picked up on it.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.160
So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
or in the city of London,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
fleecing ordinary folk

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
and money laundering?

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.160
Well I can tell you, it's quite a few of them.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.160
Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.160
And that is narcotics. Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
This one, however, is in central British Columbia

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
where I photographed it.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.160
It's one of the tens of thousands

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.160
of mom-and-pop grow-ops in B.C.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
which ensure that over five percent

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.160
of the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.160
Now, I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.160
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160
to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.160
to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160
by the RCMP

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160
from the smugglers who are sending it,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
of course, down south to the United States

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
where there is an insatiable market

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
for B.C. Bud, as it's called,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
in part because it's marketed as organic,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.160
which of course goes down very well in California.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
(Laughter)

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.160
(Applause)

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
Now, even by the police's admission,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.160
this makes not a dent in the profits, really,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
of the major exporters.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
Since the beginning of globalization,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.160
the global narcotics market has expanded enormously.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
There has, however, been no concomitant increase

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
in the resources available

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
to police forces.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.160
This, however, may all be about to change,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
because something very strange is going on.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
The United Nations recognized

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160
earlier this -- it was last month actually --

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:13.160
that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.160
of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160
Interestingly, the market share

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
of heroin and cocaine is going down,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.160
because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160
Now that is a game changer,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.160
because it shifts production away from the developing world

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.160
and into the Western world.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
When that happens, it is a trend

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.160
which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.160
The drugs policy which we've had in place for 40 years

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:54.160
is long overdue for a very serious rethink,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
in my opinion.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
Now, the recession.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
Well, organized crime has already adapted

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
very well to the recession.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
Not surprising, the most opportunistic industry

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
in the whole world.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.160
And it has no rules to its regulatory system.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.160
Except, of course, it has two business risks:

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
arrest by law enforcement,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
which is, frankly, the least of their worries,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160
and competition from other groups,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
i.e. a bullet in the back of the head.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.160
What they've done is they've shifted their operations.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.160
People don't smoke as much dope, or visit prostitutes quite so frequently

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.160
during a recession.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
And so instead, they have invaded financial

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.160
and corporate crime in a big way,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.160
but above all, two sectors,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.160
and that is counterfeit goods

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
and cybercrime.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.160
And it's been terribly successful.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.160
I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.160
Or perhaps I should say, more accurately, Señor Pringle.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.160
I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.160
We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160
in São Paulo, together.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
Hooked it up to my laptop,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
and within about five minutes he had penetrated

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
the computer security system

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
of a major Brazilian bank.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
It's really not that difficult.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160
And it's actually much easier because

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
the fascinating thing about cybercrime

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.160
is that it's not so much the technology.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.160
The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160
Or to use the technical term for it,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160
there's one born every minute.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
You would not believe how easy it is

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.160
to persuade people to do things with their computers

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160
which are objectively not in their interest.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.160
And it was very soon

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.160
when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.160
of course, the quickest way to a person's wallet

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
is through the promise of sex and love.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus,

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.160
one of the very great worldwide viruses that came.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.160
because the first person I received it from

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.160
was an ex-girlfriend of mine.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.160
Now, she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.160
but love was not amongst them.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.160
(Laughter)

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.160
And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.160
I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:26.160
and spared myself a very nasty infection.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.160
So, cybercrime, do watch out for it.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.160
One thing that we do know that the Internet is doing

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.160
is the Internet is assisting these guys.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.160
These are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.160
which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
at our expense.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.160
Now, Artesunate is a very effective drug

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.160
at destroying the parasite in the early days

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.160
of infection.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
But over the past year or so,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.160
researchers in Cambodia have discovered

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.160
that what's happening is

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.160
the malarial parasite is developing a resistance.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.160
And they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.160
is because Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market,

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.160
and so they buy it from the Internet.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.160
And these pills contain only low doses

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.160
of the active ingredient.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.160
Which is why

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.160
the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.160
The reason I say this

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160
is because we have to know

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.160
that organized crime

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.160
impacts all sorts of areas of our lives.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.160
You don't have to sleep with prostitutes

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.160
or take drugs

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.160
in order to have a relationship with organized crime.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.160
They affect our bank accounts.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.160
They affect our communications, our pension funds.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.160
They even affect the food that we eat

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.160
and our governments.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.160
This is no longer an issue

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.160
of Sicilians from Palermo and New York.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.160
There is no romance involved with gangsters

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.160
in the 21st Century.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.160
This is a mighty industry,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.160
and it creates instability and violence

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.160
wherever it goes.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.160
It is a major economic force

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.160
and we need to take it very, very seriously.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.160
It's been a privilege talking to you.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.160
Thank you very much.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.160
(Applause)
