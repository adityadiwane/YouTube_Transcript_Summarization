00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
As a researcher, every once in a while

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
you encounter something

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
a little disconcerting.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and teaches you that you're very wrong

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.260
about something that you really believed firmly in.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
And these are unfortunate moments,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
because you go to sleep that night

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
dumber than when you woke up.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
So, that's really the goal of my talk,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
is to A, communicate that moment to you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
and B, have you leave this session

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
a little dumber than when you entered.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
So, I hope I can really accomplish that.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
So, this incident that I'm going to describe

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
really began with some diarrhea.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Now, we've known for a long time the cause of diarrhea.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
That's why there's a glass of water up there.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
For us, it's a problem, the people in this room.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
For babies, it's deadly.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.260
They lack nutrients, and diarrhea dehydrates them.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And so, as a result, there is a lot of death,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
a lot of death.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
In India in 1960,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
there was a 24 percent child mortality rate,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
lots of people didn't make it. This is incredibly unfortunate.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
One of the big reasons this happened was

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
because of diarrhea.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Now, there was a big effort to solve this problem,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and there was actually a big solution.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
This solution has been called, by some,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
"potentially the most important medical

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
advance this century."

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Now, the solution turned out to be simple.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And what it was was oral rehydration salts.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
Many of you have probably used this.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
It's brilliant. It's a way to get sodium

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and glucose together so that when you add it to water

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Remarkable impact on mortality.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Massive solution to the problem.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Flash forward: 1960, 24 percent child mortality

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
has dropped to 6.5 percent today.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
Still a big number, but a big drop.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
It looks like the technological problem is solved.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
But if you look, even today

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
there are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deaths

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
in India alone.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
What's going on here?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Well the easy answer is, we just haven't gotten those salts

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
to those people.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
That's actually not true.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
If you look in areas where these salts are completely available,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
the price is low or zero, these deaths still continue abated.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Maybe there's a biological answer.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
alone doesn't solve. That's not true either.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Many of these deaths were completely preventable,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
what I want to call "the last mile" problem.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
See, we spent a lot of energy, in many domains --

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
technological, scientific, hard work,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
creativity, human ingenuity --

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
to crack important social problems with technology solutions.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
That's been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
that's mankind moving forward.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
But in this case we cracked it,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
but a big part of the problem still remains.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Nine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
the last mile's proving incredibly stubborn.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Now, that's for oral rehydration therapy.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Well, it turns out -- and this is where things get really disconcerting --

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
it's not unique to diarrhea.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
It's not even unique to poor people in India.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Here's an example from a variety of contexts.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
I've put a bunch of examples up here.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
I'll start with insulin, diabetes

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
medication in the U.S.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
OK, the American population.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
On Medicaid -- if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
or if you have health insurance -- insulin is pretty straightforward.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.260
You get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection;

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Massive technological advance:

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
took an incredibly deadly disease, made it solvable.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.260
About on average, a typical person is taking it 75 percent of the time.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.260
As a result, 25,000 people a year go blind,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
hundreds of thousands lose limbs, every year,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
for something that's solvable.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
Here I have a bunch of other examples,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
all suffer from the last mile problem.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
It's not just medicine.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Here's another example from technology:

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
agriculture. We think

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
there's a food problem, so we create new seeds.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
We think there's an income problem, so we create

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
new ways of farming that increase income.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Well, look at some old ways, some ways that we'd already cracked.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Intercropping. Intercropping really increases income.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
when you mix different varieties of rice side by side.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Some people are doing that,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
many are not. What's going on?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
This is the last mile.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
The last mile is, everywhere, problematic.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Alright, what's the problem?

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
The problem is this little three-pound machine

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.260
that's behind your eyes and between your ears.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
This machine is really strange,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and one of the consequences is that people are weird.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.260
They do lots of inconsistent things.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
(Applause)

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
They do lots of inconsistent things.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And the inconsistencies

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
create, fundamentally, this last mile problem.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
See, when we were dealing with our biology, bacteria,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
the genes, the things inside here, the blood?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
That's complex, but it's manageable.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
When we're dealing with people like this?

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
The mind is more complex.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
That's not as manageable, and that's what we're struggling with.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Let me go back to diarrhea for a second.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Here's a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
which is a survey asked of many Indian women:

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
"Your child has diarrhea.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
Should you increase, maintain or decrease the number of fluids?"

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Just so you don't embarrass yourselves, I'll give you the right answer:

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
It's increase.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.260
Now, diarrhea's interesting

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
because it's been around for thousands of years,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
ever since humankind really

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
lived side by side enough to have really polluted water.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
One Roman strategy that was very interesting

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
was that -- and it really gave them a comparative advantage --

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
they made sure their soldiers didn't drink

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
even remotely muddied waters.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Because if some of your troops get diarrhea they're not that effective

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
on the battlefield.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
So, if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.260
the breastplates, but part of it was drinking the right water.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
So, here are these women. They've seen their parents

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
have struggled with diarrhea, they've struggled with diarrhea,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
they've seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.260
In India, 35 to 50 percent say "Reduce."

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Think about what that means for a second.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Thirty-five to 50 percent of women

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
forget oral rehydration therapy,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
they are increasing --

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
they are actually making their child

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
more likely to die through their actions.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
How is that possible?

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
Well, one possibility -- I think that's how most people respond to this --

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.260
is to say, "That's just stupid."

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
I don't think that's stupid.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And that is, you don't put water

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
into a leaky bucket.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.260
So, think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
Just doesn't make sense.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Now, the model is intuitively right.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.260
It just doesn't happen to be right about the world.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
But it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
And that, to me, is the fundamental challenge

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.260
of the last mile.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
This first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Convincing people to do something --

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
take oral rehydration therapy, intercrop, whatever it might be --

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
is not an act of information:

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
"Let's give them the data,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
and when they have data they'll do the right thing."

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
It's more complex than that.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
And if you want to understand how it's more complex

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.260
let me start with something kind of interesting.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
I'm going to give you a little math problem,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
A bat and a ball together cost $1.10.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
The bat costs a dollar more than the ball.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
How much does the ball cost? Quick.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
So, somebody out there says, "Five."

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
A lot of you said, "Ten."

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Let's think about 10 for a second.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.260
If the ball costs 10, the bat costs...

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
this is easy, $1.10.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Yeah. So, together they would cost $1.20.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
So, here you all are, ostensibly educated people.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Most of you look smart.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
The combination of that produces

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
something that is actually, you got this thing wrong.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
How is that possible? Let's go to something else.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
I know algebra can be complicated.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
So, let's dial this back. That's what? Fifth grade? Fourth grade?

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
Let's go back to kindergarten. OK?

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
There's a great show on American television that you have to watch.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
It's called "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?"

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
I think we've learned the answer to that here.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
Let's move to kindergarten. Let's see if we can beat five-year-olds.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to put objects on the screen.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.260
I just want you to name the color of the object.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
That's all it is. OK?

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
I want you to do it fast, and say it out loud with me,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
and do it quickly. I'll make the first one easy for you.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
Ready? Black.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Now the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Ready? Go.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Audience: Red. Green.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
Yellow. Blue. Red.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
(Laughter)

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Sendhil Mullainathan: That's pretty good.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Almost out of kindergarten.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
What is all this telling us?

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
You see, what's going on here, and in the bat and ball problem

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
some models that you use to understand the world.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
These models, like the leaky bucket,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
work well in most situations.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
I suspect most of you --

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
I hope that's true for the rest of you --

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.260
actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
I found a problem, a specific problem

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
that actually found an error with that.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Diarrhea, and many last mile problems, are like that.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
They are situations where the mental model

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
doesn't match the reality.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Same thing here:

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
You had an intuitive response to this that was very quick.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
You read "blue" and you wanted to say "blue," even though you knew your task was red.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Now, I do this stuff because it's fun.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.260
But it's more profound than fun.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
I'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
BMW is a pretty safe car.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And they are trying to figure out, "Safety is good.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
I want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety?"

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
"I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests."

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
But the truth of the matter is, you look at that car,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
it doesn't look like a Volvo,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and it doesn't look like a Hummer.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
So, what I want you to think about for a few minutes

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
is: How would you convey safety of the BMW? Okay?

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
So now, while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
The second task is fuel efficiency. Okay?

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
Here's another puzzle for all of you.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
One person walks into a car lot,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
and they're thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
They are saying, "This is 35 miles per gallon. I'm going to do

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
the environmentally right thing, I'm going to buy the Prius,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
50 miles per gallon."

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
Another person walks into the lot,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
and they're about to buy a Hummer, nine miles per gallon,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
fully loaded, luxury.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And they say, "You know what? Do I need turbo? Do I need this heavyweight car?"

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
I'm going to do something good for the environment.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
I'm going to take off some of that weight,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
and I'm going to buy a Hummer that's 11 miles per gallon."

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Which one of these people has done more for the environment?

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
See, you have a mental model.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
Fifty versus 35, that's a big move. Eleven versus nine? Come on.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Turns out, go home and do the math,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
the nine to 11 is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Why? Because we don't care about miles per gallon, we care about

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
gallons per mile.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
Think about how powerful that is if you're trying to encourage fuel efficiency.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
Miles per gallon is the way we present things.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
If we want to encourage change of behavior,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Researchers have found these type of anomalies.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
Okay, back to BMW. What should they do?

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
The problem BMW faces is this car looks safe.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.260
This car, which is my Mini, doesn't look that safe.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
Here was BMW's brilliant insight, which they embodied into an ad campaign.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
They showed a BMW driving down the street.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
There's a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:07.260
The car swerves to avoid it, and therefore doesn't get into an accident.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.260
BWM realizes safety, in people's minds, has two components.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.260
You can be safe because when you're hit, you survive,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
or you can be safe because you avoid accidents.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
Remarkably successful campaign, but notice the power of it.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
It harnesses something you already believe.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Now, even if I persuaded you to do something,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.260
it's hard sometimes to actually get action as a result.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
You all probably intended to wake up,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
I don't know, 6:30, 7 a.m.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
This is a battle we all fight every day,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
along with trying to get to the gym.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
Now, this is an example of that battle,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
and makes us realize intentions don't always translate into action,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
and so one of the fundamental challenges

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.260
is how we would actually do that. OK?

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
So, let me now talk about the last mile problem.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
So far, I've been pretty negative.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
I've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
And I think maybe I'm being too negative.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Maybe it's the diarrhea.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
Maybe the last mile problem really should be thought of

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
as the last mile opportunity.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
Let's go back to diabetes.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
This is a typical insulin injection.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
Now, carrying this thing around is complicated.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.260
You gotta carry the bottle, you gotta carry the syringe.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
It's also painful.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.260
Now, you may think to yourself, "Well, if my eyes depended on it,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
you know, I would obviously use it every day."

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
But the pain, the discomfort,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
you know, paying attention, remembering to put it in your purse

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
when you go on a long trip:

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.260
These are the day-to-day of life, and they do pose problems.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
Here is an innovation, a design innovation.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.260
This is a pen, it's called an insulin pen, preloaded.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.260
The needle is particularly sharp.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
You just gotta carry this thing around.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
It's much easier to use, much less painful.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.260
Anywhere between five and 10 percent increase in adherence,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
just as a result of this.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
That's what I'm talking about as a last mile opportunity.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
You see, we tend to think the problem is solved

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
when we solve the technology problem.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
But the human innovation, the human problem

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.260
still remains, and that's a great frontier that we have left.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
This isn't about the biology of people;

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.260
this is now about the brains, the psychology of people,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
and innovation needs to continue all the way through

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
the last mile.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Here's another example of this.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
This is from a company called Positive Energy.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
This is about energy efficiency.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
We're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
What this company does is they send a letter

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
to households that say, "Here's your energy use,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
here's your neighbor's energy use: You're doing well." Smiley face.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
"You're doing worse." Frown.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
And what they find is just this letter, nothing else,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
And you want to think about the social value of that

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
in terms of carbon offsets, reduced electricity,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
900 million dollars per year.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
Why? Because for free,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
this isn't a new technology, this is a letter --

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
we're getting a Big Bang in behavior.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.260
So, how do we tackle the last mile?

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
I think this tells us there is an opportunity.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
And I think to tackle it, we need to combine

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
psychology,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
marketing,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
art, we've seen that.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
But you know what we need to combine it with?

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
We need to combine this with the scientific method.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.260
See what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile, to me,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
is that the first 999 miles are all about science.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.260
No one would say, "Hey, I think this medicine works, go ahead and use it."

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
We have testing, we go to the lab, we try it again, we have refinement.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
But you know what we do on the last mile?

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
"Oh, this is a good idea. People will like this. Let's put it out there."

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
The amount of resources we put in are disparate.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
We put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
How much are we putting into

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
energy behavior change

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
in a credible, systematic, testing way?

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
Now, I think that we're on the verge of something big.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
We're on the verge of a whole new social science.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
It's a social science that recognizes --

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
much like science recognizes the complexity of the body,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
biology recognizes the complexity of the body -- we'll recognize

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
the complexity of the human mind.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
The careful testing, retesting, design,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
are going to open up vistas of understanding,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
complexities, difficult things.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
And those vistas will both create new science,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.260
and fundamental change in the world as we see it, in the next hundred years.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
All right. Thank you very much.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
(Applause)

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
Chris Anderson: Sendhil, thank you so much.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
So, this whole area is so fascinating.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
I mean, it sometimes feels, listening to behavioral economists

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
that they are kind of putting into place

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
academically, what great marketers

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
have sort of intuitively known for a long time.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.260
How much is your field talking to great marketers

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
about their insights into human psychology?

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
Because they've seen it on the ground.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
Sendhil Mullainathan: Yeah, we spend a lot of time talking to marketers,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
and I think 60 percent of it is exactly what you say,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
there are insights to be gleaned there.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
Forty percent of it is about what marketing is.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:58.260
Marketing is selling an ad to a firm.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
So, in some sense, a lot of marketing is about

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
convincing a CEO, "This is a good ad campaign."

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
So, there is a little bit of slippage there.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:09.260
That's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
And one of the new movements in marketing is: How do we actually

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
measure effectiveness? Are we effective?

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.260
CA: How you take your insights here

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
and actually get them integrated

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
into working business models on the ground,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
in Indian villages, for example?

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
SM: So, the scientific method I alluded to is pretty important.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
We work closely with companies that have operational capacity,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
or nonprofits that have operational capacity.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
And then we say, "Well, you want to get this behavior change.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
Let's come up with a few ideas, test them,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
see which is working, go back, synthesize,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
and try to come up with a thing that works,"

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
and then we're able to scale with partners.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
It's kind of the model that has worked in other contexts.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
If you have biological problems

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
we try and fix it, see if it works, and then work the scale.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
CA: Alright Sendhil, thanks so much for coming to TED. Thank you.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.260
