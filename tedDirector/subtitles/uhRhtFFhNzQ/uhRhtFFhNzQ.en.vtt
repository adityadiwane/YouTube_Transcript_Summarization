00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:14.515
Right now

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:17.989
you have a movie playing inside your head.

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:20.516
It's an amazing multi-track movie.

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:23.840
It has 3D vision and surround sound

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.476
for what you're seeing and hearing right now,

00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:28.795
but that's just the start of it.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:33.978
Your movie has smell and taste and touch.

00:00:33.978 --> 00:00:36.530
It has a sense of your body,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.849
pain, hunger, orgasms.

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:42.890
It has emotions,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.426
anger and happiness.

00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:50.220
It has memories, like scenes from your childhood

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.920
playing before you.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.375
And it has this constant voiceover narrative

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:01.751
in your stream of conscious thinking.

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:06.824
At the heart of this movie is you

00:01:06.824 --> 00:01:11.189
experiencing all this directly.

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.881
This movie is your stream of consciousness,

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:18.188
the subject of experience

00:01:18.188 --> 00:01:23.326
of the mind and the world.

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:25.631
Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts

00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:27.648
of human existence.

00:01:27.648 --> 00:01:30.580
Each of us is conscious.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.309
We all have our own inner movie,

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:36.040
you and you and you.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.760
There's nothing we know about more directly.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.232
At least, I know about my consciousness directly.

00:01:43.232 --> 00:01:47.230
I can't be certain that you guys are conscious.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.658
Consciousness also is what makes life worth living.

00:01:50.658 --> 00:01:54.358
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives

00:01:54.358 --> 00:01:57.723
would have meaning or value.

00:01:57.723 --> 00:01:58.889
But at the same time, it's the most

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:03.059
mysterious phenomenon in the universe.

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:06.432
Why are we conscious?

00:02:06.432 --> 00:02:07.973
Why do we have these inner movies?

00:02:07.973 --> 00:02:10.226
Why aren't we just robots

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:12.469
who process all this input,

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:14.486
produce all that output,

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:18.341
without experiencing the inner movie at all?

00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:20.850
Right now, nobody knows the answers

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.596
to those questions.

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:26.305
I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness

00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:31.000
into science, some radical ideas may be needed.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.966
Some people say a science of consciousness

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:35.918
is impossible.

00:02:35.918 --> 00:02:39.686
Science, by its nature, is objective.

00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:43.111
Consciousness, by its nature, is subjective.

00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:47.560
So there can never be a science of consciousness.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.780
For much of the 20th century, that view held sway.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.598
Psychologists studied behavior objectively,

00:02:54.598 --> 00:02:58.660
neuroscientists studied the brain objectively,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.210
and nobody even mentioned consciousness.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.966
Even 30 years ago, when TED got started,

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:07.348
there was very little scientific work

00:03:07.348 --> 00:03:09.900
on consciousness.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.605
Now, about 20 years ago,

00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:14.578
all that began to change.

00:03:14.578 --> 00:03:17.355
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick

00:03:17.355 --> 00:03:20.111
and physicists like Roger Penrose

00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.351
said now is the time for science

00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:25.127
to attack consciousness.

00:03:25.127 --> 00:03:27.447
And since then, there's been a real explosion,

00:03:27.447 --> 00:03:29.784
a flowering of scientific work

00:03:29.784 --> 00:03:31.048
on consciousness.

00:03:31.048 --> 00:03:33.087
And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.

00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:35.175
But it also has some fundamental

00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:39.000
limitations so far.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.658
The centerpiece

00:03:40.658 --> 00:03:43.478
of the science of consciousness in recent years

00:03:43.478 --> 00:03:45.973
has been the search for correlations,

00:03:45.973 --> 00:03:49.102
correlations between certain areas of the brain

00:03:49.102 --> 00:03:53.120
and certain states of consciousness.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.210
We saw some of this kind of work

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.970
from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.246
she presented just a few minutes ago.

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:02.809
Now we understand much better, for example,

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.126
the kinds of brain areas that go along with

00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:08.497
the conscious experience of seeing faces

00:04:08.497 --> 00:04:11.617
or of feeling pain

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:14.106
or of feeling happy.

00:04:14.106 --> 00:04:16.922
But this is still a science of correlations.

00:04:16.922 --> 00:04:20.278
It's not a science of explanations.

00:04:20.278 --> 00:04:22.901
We know that these brain areas

00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:26.825
go along with certain kinds of conscious experience,

00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:30.461
but we don't know why they do.

00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:32.786
I like to put this by saying

00:04:32.786 --> 00:04:36.183
that this kind of work from neuroscience

00:04:36.183 --> 00:04:37.929
is answering some of the questions

00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:39.734
we want answered about consciousness,

00:04:39.734 --> 00:04:43.507
the questions about what certain brain areas do

00:04:43.507 --> 00:04:45.616
and what they correlate with.

00:04:45.616 --> 00:04:48.772
But in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.

00:04:48.772 --> 00:04:51.213
No knock on the neuroscientists.

00:04:51.213 --> 00:04:53.834
There are no truly easy
problems with consciousness.

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:58.425
But it doesn't address the real mystery

00:04:58.425 --> 00:05:00.355
at the core of this subject:

00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:04.575
why is it that all that physical processing in a brain

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:07.500
should be accompanied by consciousness at all?

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.706
Why is there this inner subjective movie?

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:13.960
Right now, we don't really have a bead on that.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.993
And you might say,

00:05:15.993 --> 00:05:19.548
let's just give neuroscience a few years.

00:05:19.548 --> 00:05:23.328
It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon

00:05:23.328 --> 00:05:28.210
like traffic jams, like hurricanes,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.831
like life, and we'll figure it out.

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.902
The classical cases of emergence

00:05:32.902 --> 00:05:36.280
are all cases of emergent behavior,

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.627
how a traffic jam behaves,

00:05:38.627 --> 00:05:40.123
how a hurricane functions,

00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:42.316
how a living organism reproduces

00:05:42.316 --> 00:05:45.905
and adapts and metabolizes,

00:05:45.905 --> 00:05:48.188
all questions about objective functioning.

00:05:48.188 --> 00:05:51.010
You could apply that to the human brain

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.519
in explaining some of the behaviors

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.792
and the functions of the human brain

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:55.951
as emergent phenomena:

00:05:55.951 --> 00:06:00.349
how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess,

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:02.239
all these questions about behavior.

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:04.366
But when it comes to consciousness,

00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:06.255
questions about behavior

00:06:06.255 --> 00:06:09.180
are among the easy problems.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.777
When it comes to the hard problem,

00:06:10.777 --> 00:06:13.154
that's the question of why is it

00:06:13.154 --> 00:06:14.965
that all this behavior

00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:17.810
is accompanied by subjective experience?

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.565
And here, the standard paradigm

00:06:19.565 --> 00:06:21.411
of emergence,

00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:24.358
even the standard paradigms of neuroscience,

00:06:24.358 --> 00:06:28.801
don't really, so far, have that much to say.

00:06:28.801 --> 00:06:32.446
Now, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.

00:06:32.446 --> 00:06:36.473
I want a scientific theory of consciousness

00:06:36.473 --> 00:06:38.802
that works,

00:06:38.802 --> 00:06:41.209
and for a long time, I banged my head

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:42.650
against the wall

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.787
looking for a theory of consciousness

00:06:44.787 --> 00:06:46.543
in purely physical terms

00:06:46.543 --> 00:06:47.870
that would work.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.613
But I eventually came to the conclusion

00:06:49.613 --> 00:06:53.798
that that just didn't work for systematic reasons.

00:06:53.798 --> 00:06:55.733
It's a long story,

00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:58.450
but the core idea is just that what you get

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.790
from purely reductionist explanations

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.434
in physical terms, in brain-based terms,

00:07:03.434 --> 00:07:05.549
is stories about the functioning of a system,

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:07.675
its structure, its dynamics,

00:07:07.675 --> 00:07:09.667
the behavior it produces,

00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:11.747
great for solving the easy problems —

00:07:11.747 --> 00:07:14.245
how we behave, how we function —

00:07:14.245 --> 00:07:17.698
but when it comes to subjective experience —

00:07:17.698 --> 00:07:21.259
why does all this feel like
something from the inside? —

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:23.334
that's something fundamentally new,

00:07:23.334 --> 00:07:27.227
and it's always a further question.

00:07:27.227 --> 00:07:32.640
So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.855
We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation,

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:39.455
we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry,

00:07:39.455 --> 00:07:42.695
chemistry explains biology,

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:46.542
biology explains parts of psychology.

00:07:46.542 --> 00:07:48.000
But consciousness

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.771
doesn't seem to fit into this picture.

00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:52.661
On the one hand, it's a datum

00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:54.630
that we're conscious.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.916
On the other hand, we don't know how

00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:59.894
to accommodate it into our
scientific view of the world.

00:07:59.894 --> 00:08:01.841
So I think consciousness right now

00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:04.304
is a kind of anomaly,

00:08:04.304 --> 00:08:06.340
one that we need to integrate

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.240
into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.168
Faced with an anomaly like this,

00:08:12.168 --> 00:08:15.407
radical ideas may be needed,

00:08:15.407 --> 00:08:18.412
and I think that we may need one or two ideas

00:08:18.412 --> 00:08:20.852
that initially seem crazy

00:08:20.852 --> 00:08:23.788
before we can come to grips with consciousness

00:08:23.788 --> 00:08:25.880
scientifically.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.479
Now, there are a few candidates

00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:29.975
for what those crazy ideas might be.

00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:34.317
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.

00:08:34.317 --> 00:08:36.714
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem

00:08:36.714 --> 00:08:38.457
of consciousness.

00:08:38.457 --> 00:08:41.820
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.432
involves a kind of illusion or confusion.

00:08:46.432 --> 00:08:48.330
Actually, all we've got to do is explain

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.337
the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,

00:08:51.337 --> 00:08:53.362
and then we've explained everything

00:08:53.362 --> 00:08:55.837
that needs to be explained.

00:08:55.837 --> 00:08:58.446
Well I say, more power to him.

00:08:58.446 --> 00:09:00.460
That's the kind of radical idea

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.384
that we need to explore

00:09:02.384 --> 00:09:04.723
if you want to have a purely reductionist

00:09:04.723 --> 00:09:08.273
brain-based theory of consciousness.

00:09:08.273 --> 00:09:10.344
At the same time, for me and for many other people,

00:09:10.344 --> 00:09:12.171
that view is a bit too close to simply

00:09:12.171 --> 00:09:14.192
denying the datum of consciousness

00:09:14.192 --> 00:09:15.695
to be satisfactory.

00:09:15.695 --> 00:09:18.763
So I go in a different direction.

00:09:18.763 --> 00:09:19.949
In the time remaining,

00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:22.948
I want to explore two crazy ideas

00:09:22.948 --> 00:09:26.665
that I think may have some promise.

00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:28.285
The first crazy idea

00:09:28.285 --> 00:09:32.910
is that consciousness is fundamental.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.751
Physicists sometimes take
some aspects of the universe

00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:37.911
as fundamental building blocks:

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:41.660
space and time and mass.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.270
They postulate fundamental laws governing them,

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.160
like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.470
These fundamental properties and laws

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.687
aren't explained in terms of anything more basic.

00:09:54.687 --> 00:09:57.427
Rather, they're taken as primitive,

00:09:57.427 --> 00:10:00.806
and you build up the world from there.

00:10:00.806 --> 00:10:05.905
Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:08.362
In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out

00:10:08.362 --> 00:10:11.530
that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.881
in terms of the existing fundamentals —

00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:16.950
space, time, mass, Newton's laws —

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.521
so he postulated fundamental laws

00:10:19.521 --> 00:10:21.335
of electromagnetism

00:10:21.335 --> 00:10:23.746
and postulated electric charge

00:10:23.746 --> 00:10:25.514
as a fundamental element

00:10:25.514 --> 00:10:28.473
that those laws govern.

00:10:28.473 --> 00:10:31.756
I think that's the situation we're in

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.366
with consciousness.

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:35.851
If you can't explain consciousness

00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:38.269
in terms of the existing fundamentals —

00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:40.940
space, time, mass, charge —

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.370
then as a matter of logic,
you need to expand the list.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.846
The natural thing to do is to postulate

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:50.102
consciousness itself as something fundamental,

00:10:50.102 --> 00:10:53.134
a fundamental building block of nature.

00:10:53.134 --> 00:10:56.102
This doesn't mean you suddenly
can't do science with it.

00:10:56.102 --> 00:10:59.700
This opens up the way for you to do science with it.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.604
What we then need is to study

00:11:01.604 --> 00:11:04.557
the fundamental laws governing consciousness,

00:11:04.557 --> 00:11:06.937
the laws that connect consciousness

00:11:06.937 --> 00:11:09.738
to other fundamentals: space, time, mass,

00:11:09.738 --> 00:11:12.674
physical processes.

00:11:12.674 --> 00:11:14.856
Physicists sometimes say

00:11:14.856 --> 00:11:17.736
that we want fundamental laws so simple

00:11:17.736 --> 00:11:21.538
that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.

00:11:21.538 --> 00:11:23.259
Well I think something like that is the situation

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:25.127
we're in with consciousness.

00:11:25.127 --> 00:11:27.877
We want to find fundamental laws so simple

00:11:27.877 --> 00:11:29.964
we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.

00:11:29.964 --> 00:11:31.539
We don't know what those laws are yet,

00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:35.566
but that's what we're after.

00:11:35.566 --> 00:11:37.983
The second crazy idea

00:11:37.983 --> 00:11:41.461
is that consciousness might be universal.

00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:44.522
Every system might have some degree

00:11:44.522 --> 00:11:48.247
of consciousness.

00:11:48.247 --> 00:11:51.208
This view is sometimes called panpsychism:

00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:54.210
pan for all, psych for mind,

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.981
every system is conscious,

00:11:55.981 --> 00:12:00.228
not just humans, dogs, mice, flies,

00:12:00.228 --> 00:12:02.805
but even Rob Knight's microbes,

00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:04.992
elementary particles.

00:12:04.992 --> 00:12:07.705
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.

00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:11.484
The idea is not that photons are intelligent

00:12:11.484 --> 00:12:12.561
or thinking.

00:12:12.561 --> 00:12:13.991
It's not that a photon

00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:15.436
is wracked with angst

00:12:15.436 --> 00:12:18.728
because it's thinking, "Aww, I'm always
buzzing around near the speed of light.

00:12:18.728 --> 00:12:21.720
I never get to slow down and smell the roses."

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.864
No, not like that.

00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:26.912
But the thought is maybe photons might have

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:29.535
some element of raw, subjective feeling,

00:12:29.535 --> 00:12:33.687
some primitive precursor to consciousness.

00:12:33.687 --> 00:12:36.541
This may sound a bit kooky to you.

00:12:36.541 --> 00:12:39.324
I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?

00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:42.884
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea,

00:12:42.884 --> 00:12:45.030
that consciousness is fundamental.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.405
If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,

00:12:49.405 --> 00:12:52.070
it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.970
the way they are.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.919
It's also worth noting that although the idea

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:57.943
seems counterintuitive to us,

00:12:57.943 --> 00:13:00.687
it's much less counterintuitive to people

00:13:00.687 --> 00:13:02.418
from different cultures,

00:13:02.418 --> 00:13:03.938
where the human mind is seen as much more

00:13:03.938 --> 00:13:07.010
continuous with nature.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.744
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that

00:13:10.744 --> 00:13:12.753
perhaps the most simple and powerful way

00:13:12.753 --> 00:13:14.987
to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness

00:13:14.987 --> 00:13:16.967
to physical processing

00:13:16.967 --> 00:13:20.062
is to link consciousness to information.

00:13:20.062 --> 00:13:22.073
Wherever there's information processing,

00:13:22.073 --> 00:13:23.138
there's consciousness.

00:13:23.138 --> 00:13:25.678
Complex information processing, like in a human,

00:13:25.688 --> 00:13:27.220
complex consciousness.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.349
Simple information processing,

00:13:29.349 --> 00:13:31.307
simple consciousness.

00:13:31.307 --> 00:13:33.638
A really exciting thing is in recent years

00:13:33.638 --> 00:13:36.903
a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,

00:13:36.903 --> 00:13:38.146
has taken this kind of theory

00:13:38.146 --> 00:13:40.221
and developed it rigorously

00:13:40.221 --> 00:13:42.070
with a mathematical theory.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:43.587
He has a mathematical measure

00:13:43.587 --> 00:13:45.317
of information integration

00:13:45.317 --> 00:13:47.236
which he calls phi,

00:13:47.236 --> 00:13:48.843
measuring the amount of information

00:13:48.843 --> 00:13:50.463
integrated in a system.

00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:52.832
And he supposes that phi goes along

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.270
with consciousness.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.591
So in a human brain,

00:13:55.591 --> 00:13:58.110
incredibly large amount of information integration,

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.144
high degree of phi,

00:14:00.144 --> 00:14:01.693
a whole lot of consciousness.

00:14:01.693 --> 00:14:05.386
In a mouse, medium degree
of information integration,

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:06.405
still pretty significant,

00:14:06.405 --> 00:14:08.430
pretty serious amount of consciousness.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.695
But as you go down to worms,

00:14:10.695 --> 00:14:14.172
microbes, particles,

00:14:14.172 --> 00:14:15.706
the amount of phi falls off.

00:14:15.706 --> 00:14:18.139
The amount of information integration falls off,

00:14:18.139 --> 00:14:19.587
but it's still non-zero.

00:14:19.587 --> 00:14:21.526
On Tononi's theory,

00:14:21.526 --> 00:14:23.733
there's still going to be a non-zero degree

00:14:23.733 --> 00:14:25.562
of consciousness.

00:14:25.562 --> 00:14:28.101
In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law

00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:31.485
of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.

00:14:31.485 --> 00:14:34.107
Now, I don't know if this theory is right,

00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:37.318
but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now

00:14:37.318 --> 00:14:38.704
in the science of consciousness,

00:14:38.704 --> 00:14:40.935
and it's been used to integrate a whole range

00:14:40.935 --> 00:14:43.322
of scientific data,

00:14:43.322 --> 00:14:45.565
and it does have a nice property
that it is in fact simple enough

00:14:45.565 --> 00:14:49.060
you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.685
Another final motivation is that

00:14:51.685 --> 00:14:53.736
panpsychism might help us to integrate

00:14:53.736 --> 00:14:56.950
consciousness into the physical world.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.127
Physicists and philosophers have often observed

00:15:00.127 --> 00:15:02.568
that physics is curiously abstract.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.716
It describes the structure of reality

00:15:04.716 --> 00:15:06.800
using a bunch of equations,

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.824
but it doesn't tell us about the reality

00:15:09.824 --> 00:15:11.392
that underlies it.

00:15:11.392 --> 00:15:13.289
As Stephen Hawking puts it,

00:15:13.289 --> 00:15:17.343
what puts the fire into the equations?

00:15:17.343 --> 00:15:19.961
Well, on the panpsychist view,

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:22.600
you can leave the equations of physics as they are,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.164
but you can take them to be describing

00:15:24.164 --> 00:15:25.838
the flux of consciousness.

00:15:25.838 --> 00:15:27.876
That's what physics really is ultimately doing,

00:15:27.876 --> 00:15:30.205
describing the flux of consciousness.

00:15:30.205 --> 00:15:31.858
On this view, it's consciousness

00:15:31.858 --> 00:15:36.104
that puts the fire into the equations.

00:15:36.104 --> 00:15:37.764
On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle

00:15:37.764 --> 00:15:39.440
outside the physical world

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.858
as some kind of extra.

00:15:40.858 --> 00:15:44.314
It's there right at its heart.

00:15:44.314 --> 00:15:47.188
This view, I think, the panpsychist view,

00:15:47.188 --> 00:15:50.489
has the potential to transfigure our relationship

00:15:50.489 --> 00:15:51.984
to nature,

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:54.219
and it may have some pretty serious social

00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:57.912
and ethical consequences.

00:15:57.912 --> 00:16:00.071
Some of these may be counterintuitive.

00:16:00.071 --> 00:16:03.142
I used to think I shouldn't eat anything

00:16:03.142 --> 00:16:05.604
which is conscious,

00:16:05.604 --> 00:16:08.208
so therefore I should be vegetarian.

00:16:08.208 --> 00:16:10.775
Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view,

00:16:10.775 --> 00:16:13.505
you're going to go very hungry.

00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:14.793
So I think when you think about it,

00:16:14.793 --> 00:16:16.960
this tends to transfigure your views,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.203
whereas what matters for ethical purposes

00:16:19.203 --> 00:16:20.477
and moral considerations,

00:16:20.477 --> 00:16:23.554
not so much the fact of consciousness,

00:16:23.554 --> 00:16:27.510
but the degree and the complexity of consciousness.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:29.448
It's also natural to ask about consciousness

00:16:29.448 --> 00:16:32.498
in other systems, like computers.

00:16:32.498 --> 00:16:34.287
What about the artificially intelligent system

00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:37.729
in the movie "Her," Samantha?

00:16:37.729 --> 00:16:39.129
Is she conscious?

00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:40.560
Well, if you take the informational,

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.740
panpsychist view,

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.211
she certainly has complicated information processing

00:16:45.211 --> 00:16:46.632
and integration,

00:16:46.632 --> 00:16:49.299
so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:52.237
If that's right, it raises pretty serious

00:16:52.237 --> 00:16:54.602
ethical issues about both the ethics

00:16:54.602 --> 00:16:58.123
of developing intelligent computer systems

00:16:58.123 --> 00:17:00.859
and the ethics of turning them off.

00:17:00.859 --> 00:17:03.359
Finally, you might ask about the consciousness

00:17:03.359 --> 00:17:05.241
of whole groups,

00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:07.078
the planet.

00:17:07.078 --> 00:17:10.001
Does Canada have its own consciousness?

00:17:10.001 --> 00:17:12.100
Or at a more local level,

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.308
does an integrated group

00:17:13.308 --> 00:17:15.571
like the audience at a TED conference,

00:17:15.571 --> 00:17:19.020
are we right now having a
collective TED consciousness,

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.513
an inner movie

00:17:20.513 --> 00:17:23.319
for this collective TED group

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:24.999
which is distinct from the inner movies

00:17:24.999 --> 00:17:26.088
of each of our parts?

00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:28.243
I don't know the answer to that question,

00:17:28.253 --> 00:17:29.624
but I think it's at least one

00:17:29.624 --> 00:17:32.098
worth taking seriously.

00:17:32.098 --> 00:17:34.435
Okay, so this panpsychist vision,

00:17:34.435 --> 00:17:36.248
it is a radical one,

00:17:36.248 --> 00:17:38.462
and I don't know that it's correct.

00:17:38.462 --> 00:17:40.315
I'm actually more confident about

00:17:40.315 --> 00:17:41.948
the first crazy idea,

00:17:41.948 --> 00:17:44.117
that consciousness is fundamental,

00:17:44.117 --> 00:17:45.920
than about the second one,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.141
that it's universal.

00:17:48.141 --> 00:17:50.219
I mean, the view raises any number of questions,

00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:51.760
has any number of challenges,

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.120
like how do those little bits

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.860
of consciousness add up

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.157
to the kind of complex consciousness

00:17:57.157 --> 00:17:59.480
we know and love.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.940
If we can answer those questions,

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.445
then I think we're going to be well on our way

00:18:02.445 --> 00:18:05.532
to a serious theory of consciousness.

00:18:05.532 --> 00:18:08.920
If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.764
in science and philosophy.

00:18:10.764 --> 00:18:14.209
We can't expect to solve it overnight.

00:18:14.209 --> 00:18:17.749
But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.

00:18:17.749 --> 00:18:20.736
Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think,

00:18:20.736 --> 00:18:23.188
both to understanding the universe

00:18:23.188 --> 00:18:25.718
and to understanding ourselves.

00:18:25.718 --> 00:18:28.621
It may just take the right crazy idea.

00:18:28.621 --> 00:18:30.612
Thank you.

00:18:30.612 --> 00:18:32.300
(Applause)
