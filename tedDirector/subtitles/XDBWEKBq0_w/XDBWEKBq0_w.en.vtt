00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.129
The idea of eliminating poverty
is a great goal.

00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:21.806
I don't think anyone
in this room would disagree.

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:27.036
What worries me
is when politicians with money

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.681
and charismatic rock stars --

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:31.285
(Laughter)

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:32.626
use the words,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.819
" ... it all just sounds so, so simple."

00:00:39.073 --> 00:00:42.165
Now, I've got no bucket of money today

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:45.380
and I've got no policy to release,

00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:47.643
and I certainly haven't got a guitar.

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.527
I'll leave that to others.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.122
But I do have an idea,

00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:54.764
and that idea is called
Housing for Health.

00:00:55.344 --> 00:00:58.037
Housing for Health works with poor people.

00:00:58.061 --> 00:01:01.092
It works in the places where they live,

00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:04.218
and the work is done
to improve their health.

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.204
Over the last 28 years,

00:01:07.228 --> 00:01:10.656
this tough, grinding, dirty work

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.141
has been done by literally
thousands of people around Australia

00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:17.605
and, more recently, overseas,

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:19.833
and their work has proven

00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:25.307
that focused design can improve
even the poorest living environments.

00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:26.673
It can improve health

00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:31.462
and it can play a part in reducing,
if not eliminating, poverty.

00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:35.307
I'm going to start
where the story began --

00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:39.176
1985, in Central Australia.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.923
A man called Yami Lester,
an Aboriginal man,

00:01:41.947 --> 00:01:43.785
was running a health service.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:48.575
Eighty percent of what walked
in the door, in terms of illness,

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:50.788
was infectious disease --

00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:53.660
third world, developing world
infectious disease,

00:01:53.684 --> 00:01:56.447
caused by a poor living environment.

00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:02.953
Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs.

00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:05.442
He got a medical doctor.

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:08.242
He got an environmental health guy.

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:13.010
And he hand-selected a team
of local Aboriginal people

00:02:13.034 --> 00:02:14.667
to work on this project.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.245
Yami told us at that first meeting,

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.011
"There's no money," --
always a good start --

00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:24.524
" ... no money, you have six months,

00:02:24.548 --> 00:02:27.562
and I want you to start on a project --"
which, in his language,

00:02:27.586 --> 00:02:30.314
he called "Uwankara Palyanku Kanyintjaku,"

00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:35.300
which, translated, is "a plan
to stop people getting sick" --

00:02:35.324 --> 00:02:36.737
a profound brief.

00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:40.827
That was our task.

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:46.300
First step, the medical doctor went away
for about six months.

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:51.363
And he worked on what were to become
these nine health goals --

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:53.223
what were we aiming at?

00:02:55.236 --> 00:02:57.427
After six months of work,
he came to my office

00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:02.022
and presented me with
those nine words on a piece of paper.

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:06.042
[The 9 Healthy Living Practices: Washing,
clothes, wastewater, nutrition, crowding,

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:07.733
animals, dust, temperature, injury]

00:03:07.757 --> 00:03:11.027
I was very unimpressed.
Big ideas need big words,

00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:12.762
and preferably a lot of them.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.266
This didn't fit the bill.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.656
What I didn't see and what you can't see

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.994
was that he'd assembled thousands of pages

00:03:24.018 --> 00:03:27.784
of local, national
and international health research

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:32.610
that filled out the picture
as to why these were the health targets.

00:03:32.634 --> 00:03:36.786
The pictures that came a bit later
had a very simple reason.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.073
The Aboriginal people who were our bosses
and the senior people

00:03:40.097 --> 00:03:42.439
were most commonly illiterate,

00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:44.622
so the story had to be told in pictures

00:03:44.646 --> 00:03:46.347
of what these goals were.

00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:48.673
We worked with the community,

00:03:48.697 --> 00:03:50.680
not telling them what was going to happen

00:03:50.704 --> 00:03:52.533
in a language they didn't understand.

00:03:53.593 --> 00:03:56.836
So we had the goals
and each one of these goals --

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.721
and I won't go through them all --

00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:02.824
puts at the center the person
and their health issue,

00:04:02.848 --> 00:04:04.800
and it then connects them

00:04:04.824 --> 00:04:09.309
to the bits of the physical
environment that are actually needed

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:10.865
to keep their health good.

00:04:11.262 --> 00:04:13.943
And the highest priority,
you see on the screen,

00:04:13.967 --> 00:04:17.768
is washing people once a day,
particularly children.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.064
And I hope most of you are thinking,

00:04:20.088 --> 00:04:21.390
"What? That sounds simple."

00:04:21.414 --> 00:04:25.470
Now, I'm going to ask you all
a very personal question.

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:26.875
This morning before you came,

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:31.070
who could have had a wash using a shower?

00:04:32.198 --> 00:04:35.413
I'm not going to ask if you had a shower,
because I'm too polite.

00:04:35.437 --> 00:04:36.588
That's it.

00:04:36.612 --> 00:04:37.613
(Laughter)

00:04:37.637 --> 00:04:39.399
All right, I think it's fair to say

00:04:39.423 --> 00:04:42.470
most people here could have had
a shower this morning.

00:04:42.494 --> 00:04:44.618
I'm going to ask you to do some more work.

00:04:44.642 --> 00:04:47.146
I want you all to select one of the houses

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.222
of the 25 houses you see on the screen.

00:04:49.246 --> 00:04:52.652
I want you to select one of them
and note the position of that house

00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:54.053
and keep that in your head.

00:04:54.077 --> 00:04:55.603
Have you all got a house?

00:04:55.627 --> 00:04:58.077
I'm going to ask you to live there
for a few months,

00:04:58.101 --> 00:04:59.707
so make sure you've got it right.

00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:02.754
It's in the northwest of
Western Australia, very pleasant place.

00:05:02.778 --> 00:05:05.990
OK. Let's see if your shower
in that house is working.

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:10.463
I hear some "Aw!" and I hear some "Ah!"

00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:13.267
If you get a green tick,
your shower's working.

00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:14.577
You and your kids are fine.

00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:16.970
If you get a red cross,

00:05:16.994 --> 00:05:19.233
well, I've looked carefully
around the room

00:05:19.257 --> 00:05:22.433
and it's not going to make
much difference to this crew.

00:05:22.457 --> 00:05:24.981
Why? Because you're all too old.

00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:28.217
I know that's going to come as a shock
to some of you, but you are.

00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:30.120
And before you get offended and leave,

00:05:30.144 --> 00:05:31.960
I've got to say that being too old,

00:05:31.984 --> 00:05:35.532
in this case, means that pretty much
everyone in the room, I think,

00:05:35.556 --> 00:05:37.461
is over five years of age.

00:05:39.465 --> 00:05:42.226
We're really concerned
with kids naught to five.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.470
And why?

00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:48.747
Washing is the antidote
to the sort of bugs,

00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:51.994
the common infectious diseases
of the eyes, the ears,

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.414
the chest and the skin

00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:57.310
that, if they occur in the first
five years of life,

00:05:57.334 --> 00:06:00.737
permanently damage those organs.

00:06:01.515 --> 00:06:04.194
They leave a lifelong remnant.

00:06:05.123 --> 00:06:07.225
That means that by the age of five,

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:09.535
you can't see as well
for the rest of your life.

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:12.049
You can't hear as well
for the rest of your life.

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:13.415
You can't breathe as well.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.929
You've lost a third of your lung
capacity by the age of five.

00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:18.796
And even skin infection,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.376
which we originally thought
wasn't that big a problem,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.625
mild skin infections
naught to five give you

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:27.105
a greatly increased
chance of renal failure,

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:29.673
needing dialysis at age 40.

00:06:30.364 --> 00:06:33.259
This is a big deal, so the ticks
and crosses on the screen

00:06:33.283 --> 00:06:36.147
are actually critical for young kids.

00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:39.806
Those ticks and crosses
represent the 7,800 houses

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.894
we've looked at nationally
around Australia,

00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:43.327
the same proportion.

00:06:43.351 --> 00:06:44.806
What you see on the screen --

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.063
35 percent of those not-so-famous houses

00:06:48.087 --> 00:06:50.963
lived in by 50,000 indigenous people --

00:06:50.987 --> 00:06:53.548
35 percent had a working shower.

00:06:54.167 --> 00:06:59.937
Ten percent of those same 7,800 houses
had safe electrical systems.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.610
And 58 percent of those houses
had a working toilet.

00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:10.433
These are by a simple, standard test.

00:07:10.457 --> 00:07:12.858
In the case of the shower:

00:07:12.882 --> 00:07:17.390
does it have hot and cold water,
two taps that work,

00:07:17.414 --> 00:07:22.163
a shower rose to get water
onto your head or onto your body,

00:07:22.187 --> 00:07:24.021
and a drain that takes the water away?

00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:28.093
Not well-designed,
not beautiful, not elegant --

00:07:28.117 --> 00:07:29.284
just that they function.

00:07:29.308 --> 00:07:31.531
And the same tests
for the electrical system

00:07:31.555 --> 00:07:32.886
and the toilets.

00:07:33.811 --> 00:07:36.743
Housing for Health projects
aren't about measuring failure --

00:07:36.767 --> 00:07:39.065
they're actually about improving houses.

00:07:39.475 --> 00:07:43.369
We start on day one of every project.

00:07:43.393 --> 00:07:46.632
We've learned -- we don't make promises,
we don't do reports.

00:07:46.656 --> 00:07:51.978
We arrive in the morning with tools,
tons of equipment, trades,

00:07:52.002 --> 00:07:55.486
and we train up a local team
on the first day to start work.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.290
By the evening of the first day,

00:07:57.314 --> 00:08:01.725
a few houses in that community are better
than when we started in the morning.

00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:04.004
That work continues for six to 12 months,

00:08:04.028 --> 00:08:05.726
until all the houses are improved

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.351
and we've spent our budget
of 7,500 dollars total per house.

00:08:10.375 --> 00:08:11.879
That's our average budget.

00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:16.747
At the end of six months to a year,
we test every house again.

00:08:16.771 --> 00:08:18.832
It's very easy to spend money.

00:08:18.856 --> 00:08:21.174
It's very difficult to improve

00:08:21.198 --> 00:08:23.603
the function of all those
parts of the house.

00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:26.623
And for a whole house,
the nine healthy living practices,

00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:30.308
we test, check and fix
250 items in every house.

00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:35.251
And these are the results we can get
with our 7,500 dollars.

00:08:35.275 --> 00:08:37.877
We can get showers
up to 86 percent working,

00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:41.692
we can get electrical systems
up to 77 percent working

00:08:41.716 --> 00:08:44.349
and we can get 90 percent
of toilets working

00:08:44.373 --> 00:08:46.532
in those 7,500 houses.

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:48.407
(Applause)

00:08:48.431 --> 00:08:49.679
Thank you.

00:08:49.703 --> 00:08:55.997
(Applause)

00:08:56.021 --> 00:08:58.996
The teams do a great job,
and that's their work.

00:09:00.816 --> 00:09:02.932
I think there's an obvious question

00:09:02.956 --> 00:09:04.806
that I hope you're thinking about.

00:09:05.593 --> 00:09:07.545
Why do we have to do this work?

00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:10.699
Why are the houses in such poor condition?

00:09:11.271 --> 00:09:14.808
Seventy percent of the work we do
is due to lack of routine maintenance --

00:09:14.832 --> 00:09:17.237
the sort of things that happen
in all our houses.

00:09:17.261 --> 00:09:21.144
Things wear out, should have been done
by state government or local government,

00:09:21.168 --> 00:09:24.354
simply not done, the house doesn't work.

00:09:24.378 --> 00:09:28.269
Twenty-one percent of the things we fix
are due to faulty construction --

00:09:28.293 --> 00:09:31.294
literally things that are built
upside down and back to front.

00:09:31.318 --> 00:09:33.167
They don't work, we have to fix them.

00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:39.681
And if you've lived in Australia
in the last 30 years, the final cause --

00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:43.360
you will have heard always
that indigenous people trash houses.

00:09:43.384 --> 00:09:46.822
It's one of the almost
rock-solid pieces of evidence

00:09:46.846 --> 00:09:48.861
which I've never seen evidence for,

00:09:48.885 --> 00:09:52.345
that's always reeled out as "That's
the problem with indigenous housing."

00:09:52.369 --> 00:09:54.539
Well, nine percent
of what we spend is damage,

00:09:54.563 --> 00:09:56.234
misuse or abuse of any sort.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.165
We argue strongly that the people
living in the house

00:10:01.189 --> 00:10:02.820
are simply not the problem.

00:10:03.384 --> 00:10:05.182
And we'll go a lot further than that;

00:10:05.206 --> 00:10:09.019
the people living in the house
are actually a major part of the solution.

00:10:09.749 --> 00:10:13.114
Seventy-five percent
of our national team in Australia --

00:10:13.138 --> 00:10:15.591
over 75 at the minute --

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:19.943
are actually local, indigenous people
from the communities we work in.

00:10:19.967 --> 00:10:21.721
They do all aspects of the work.

00:10:22.192 --> 00:10:27.929
(Applause)

00:10:27.953 --> 00:10:31.811
In 2010, for example, there were 831,

00:10:31.835 --> 00:10:34.408
all over Australia,
and the Torres Strait Islands,

00:10:34.432 --> 00:10:38.891
all states, working to improve the houses
where they and their families live,

00:10:38.915 --> 00:10:41.174
and that's an important thing.

00:10:41.198 --> 00:10:44.308
Our work's always had a focus on health.

00:10:44.332 --> 00:10:45.498
That's the key.

00:10:46.434 --> 00:10:49.894
The developing world bug,
trachoma, causes blindness.

00:10:49.918 --> 00:10:52.284
It's a developing-world illness,

00:10:52.308 --> 00:10:54.137
and yet, the picture you see behind

00:10:54.161 --> 00:10:57.957
is in an Aboriginal community
in the late 1990s,

00:10:57.981 --> 00:11:01.981
where 95 percent of school-aged
kids had active trachoma

00:11:02.005 --> 00:11:03.960
in their eyes, doing damage.

00:11:05.142 --> 00:11:06.418
OK, what do we do?

00:11:06.442 --> 00:11:09.745
Well, first thing we do,
we get showers working.

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:11.610
Why? Because that flushes the bug out.

00:11:11.634 --> 00:11:13.975
We put washing facilities
in the school as well,

00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:16.736
so kids can wash their faces
many times during the day.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.649
We wash the bug out.

00:11:18.673 --> 00:11:22.514
Second, the eye doctors tell us
that dust scours the eye

00:11:22.538 --> 00:11:23.855
and lets the bug in quick.

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:25.088
So what do we do?

00:11:25.112 --> 00:11:28.612
We call up the doctor of dust,
and there is such a person.

00:11:28.636 --> 00:11:30.562
He was loaned to us by a mining company.

00:11:30.586 --> 00:11:33.256
He controls dust on mining company sites.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.083
And he came out and, within a day,

00:11:35.107 --> 00:11:37.298
it worked out that most dust
in this community

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:40.572
was within a meter of the ground,
the wind-driven dust --

00:11:40.596 --> 00:11:43.477
so he suggested making mounds
to catch the dust

00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:47.223
before it went into the house area
and affected the eyes of kids.

00:11:47.247 --> 00:11:50.790
So we used dirt to stop dust.

00:11:50.814 --> 00:11:53.582
We did it. He provided us dust monitors.

00:11:53.606 --> 00:11:56.062
We tested and we reduced the dust.

00:11:56.086 --> 00:11:58.287
Then we wanted to get rid
of the bug generally.

00:11:58.311 --> 00:11:59.461
So how do we do that?

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:04.219
Well, we call up the doctor of flies --
and, yes, there is a doctor of flies.

00:12:04.728 --> 00:12:06.282
As our Aboriginal mate said,

00:12:06.306 --> 00:12:08.417
"You white fellows ought to get out more."

00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:10.671
(Laughter)

00:12:10.695 --> 00:12:13.800
And the doctor of flies
very quickly determined

00:12:13.824 --> 00:12:17.902
that there was one fly
that carried the bug.

00:12:17.926 --> 00:12:20.349
He could give school kids
in this community

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:23.551
the beautiful fly trap you see
above in the slide.

00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:26.111
They could trap the flies,
send them to him in Perth.

00:12:26.635 --> 00:12:28.088
When the bug was in the gut,

00:12:28.112 --> 00:12:31.079
he'd send back by return post
some dung beetles.

00:12:31.103 --> 00:12:33.396
The dung beetles ate the camel dung,

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.166
the flies died through lack of food,

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:36.499
and trachoma dropped.

00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:42.336
And over the year, trachoma dropped
radically in this place, and stayed low.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.802
We changed the environment,
not just treated the eyes.

00:12:47.079 --> 00:12:49.524
And finally, you get a good eye.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.705
All these small health gains

00:12:52.729 --> 00:12:55.951
and small pieces of the puzzle
make a big difference.

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:57.958
The New South Wales Department of Health,

00:12:57.982 --> 00:12:59.259
that radical organization,

00:12:59.283 --> 00:13:02.823
did an independent trial over three years

00:13:02.847 --> 00:13:05.420
to look at 10 years of the work
we've been doing

00:13:05.444 --> 00:13:07.912
in these sorts of projects
in New South Wales.

00:13:07.936 --> 00:13:13.480
And they found a 40 percent reduction
in hospital admissions

00:13:13.504 --> 00:13:17.234
for the illnesses that you could attribute
to the poor environment --

00:13:17.258 --> 00:13:19.628
a 40 percent reduction.

00:13:19.652 --> 00:13:26.616
(Applause)

00:13:27.845 --> 00:13:30.567
Just to show that the principles
we've used in Australia

00:13:30.591 --> 00:13:31.929
can be used in other places,

00:13:31.953 --> 00:13:34.691
I'm just going to go
to one other place, and that's Nepal.

00:13:34.715 --> 00:13:36.326
And what a beautiful place to go.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.711
We were asked by a small
village of 600 people

00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:43.740
to go in and make toilets
where none existed.

00:13:43.764 --> 00:13:44.975
Health was poor.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.739
We went in with no grand plan,

00:13:47.763 --> 00:13:49.890
no grand promises of a great program,

00:13:49.914 --> 00:13:53.122
just the offer to build
two toilets for two families.

00:13:53.146 --> 00:13:56.494
It was during the design
of the first toilet

00:13:56.518 --> 00:13:57.777
that I went for lunch,

00:13:57.801 --> 00:14:00.850
invited by the family
into their main room of the house.

00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:02.874
It was choking with smoke.

00:14:02.898 --> 00:14:06.473
People were cooking
on their only fuel source, green timber.

00:14:06.497 --> 00:14:08.594
The smoke coming off
that timber is choking,

00:14:08.618 --> 00:14:11.318
and in an enclosed house,
you simply can't breathe.

00:14:12.048 --> 00:14:15.938
Later we found the leading cause
of illness and death

00:14:15.962 --> 00:14:19.517
in this particular region
is through respiratory failure.

00:14:19.541 --> 00:14:21.665
So all of a sudden, we had two problems.

00:14:21.689 --> 00:14:23.753
We were there originally
to look at toilets

00:14:23.777 --> 00:14:26.075
and get human waste
off the ground, that's fine.

00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:29.013
But all of a sudden now
there was a second problem:

00:14:29.037 --> 00:14:30.862
How do we actually get the smoke down?

00:14:30.886 --> 00:14:34.922
So two problems, and design should
be about more than one thing.

00:14:34.946 --> 00:14:38.516
Solution: Take human waste,
take animal waste,

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.898
put it into a chamber,
out of that, extract biogas,

00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:43.561
methane gas.

00:14:43.585 --> 00:14:46.986
The gas gives three to four
hours cooking a day --

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.650
clean, smokeless and free for the family.

00:14:50.674 --> 00:14:55.818
(Applause)

00:14:55.842 --> 00:14:58.726
I put it to you:
is this eliminating poverty?

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:03.162
And the answer from the Nepali team
who's working at the minute would say,

00:15:03.186 --> 00:15:04.337
don't be ridiculous --

00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:06.433
we have three million
more toilets to build

00:15:06.457 --> 00:15:09.308
before we can even make
a stab at that claim.

00:15:09.332 --> 00:15:12.291
And I don't pretend anything else.

00:15:12.315 --> 00:15:14.973
But as we all sit here today,

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.833
there are now over 100 toilets built

00:15:16.857 --> 00:15:19.270
in this village and a couple nearby.

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:22.743
Well over 1,000 people use those toilets.

00:15:22.767 --> 00:15:25.942
Yami Lama, he's a young boy.

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:30.270
He's got significantly less gut infection
because he's now got toilets,

00:15:30.294 --> 00:15:32.654
and there isn't human waste on the ground.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.357
Kanji Maya, she's a mother,
and a proud one.

00:15:37.381 --> 00:15:41.824
She's probably right now
cooking lunch for her family

00:15:41.848 --> 00:15:44.293
on biogas, smokeless fuel.

00:15:44.317 --> 00:15:45.563
Her lungs have got better,

00:15:45.587 --> 00:15:47.563
and they'll get better as time increases,

00:15:47.587 --> 00:15:49.768
because she's not cooking
in the same smoke.

00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:52.394
Surya takes the waste
out of the biogas chamber

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:55.335
when it's shed the gas,
he puts it on his crops.

00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:58.057
He's trebled his crop income,

00:15:58.081 --> 00:16:00.996
more food for the family
and more money for the family.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.774
And finally Bishnu,
the leader of the team,

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:08.961
has now understood that not only
have we built toilets,

00:16:08.985 --> 00:16:11.137
we've also built a team,

00:16:11.161 --> 00:16:13.793
and that team is now
working in two villages

00:16:13.817 --> 00:16:16.290
where they're training up
the next two villages

00:16:16.314 --> 00:16:18.144
to keep the work expanding.

00:16:18.168 --> 00:16:19.793
And that, to me, is the key.

00:16:19.817 --> 00:16:24.484
(Applause)

00:16:24.508 --> 00:16:27.212
People are not the problem.

00:16:28.609 --> 00:16:30.196
We've never found that.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.915
The problem: poor living environment,

00:16:32.939 --> 00:16:35.907
poor housing and the bugs
that do people harm.

00:16:37.137 --> 00:16:42.876
None of those are limited by geography,
by skin color or by religion.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.278
None of them.

00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:47.540
The common link between all
the work we've had to do

00:16:47.564 --> 00:16:49.435
is one thing, and that's poverty.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:55.187
Nelson Mandela said, in the mid-2000s,
not too far from here,

00:16:55.211 --> 00:17:01.492
he said that like slavery and apartheid,
"Poverty is not natural.

00:17:01.516 --> 00:17:05.375
It is man-made and can be
overcome and eradicated

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:07.523
by the actions of human beings."

00:17:08.864 --> 00:17:10.173
I want to end by saying

00:17:10.197 --> 00:17:16.354
it's been the actions of thousands
of ordinary human beings

00:17:16.378 --> 00:17:19.603
doing -- I think -- extraordinary work,

00:17:19.627 --> 00:17:22.271
that have actually improved health,

00:17:22.295 --> 00:17:25.416
and, maybe only in a small way,
reduced poverty.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.112
Thank you very much for your time.

00:17:27.136 --> 00:17:33.841
(Applause)
