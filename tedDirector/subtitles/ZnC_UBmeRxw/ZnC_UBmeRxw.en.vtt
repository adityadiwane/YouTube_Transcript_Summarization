00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:14.453
Carlos,

00:00:14.477 --> 00:00:16.030
the Vietnam vet Marine

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:19.838
who volunteered for three tours
and got shot up in every one.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.752
In 1971, he was medically retired

00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:25.075
because he had so much
shrapnel in his body

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.217
that he was setting off metal detectors.

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.380
For the next 42 years,
he suffered from nightmares,

00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:33.618
extreme anxiety in public,

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:35.653
isolation, depression.

00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:37.581
He self-medicated with alcohol.

00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:40.511
He was married and divorced three times.

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:43.256
Carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.706
Now, I became a psychologist
to help mitigate human suffering,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.217
and for the past 10 years, my target
has been the suffering caused by PTSD,

00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:54.763
as experienced by veterans like Carlos.

00:00:55.356 --> 00:01:00.573
Until recently, the science of PTSD
just wasn't there.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.537
And so, we didn't know what to do.

00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:05.925
We put some veterans on heavy drugs.

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:08.753
Others we hospitalized
and gave generic group therapy,

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.875
and others still we simply said to them,

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.213
"Just go home and try to forget
about your experiences."

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:18.877
More recently, we've tried therapy dogs,
wilderness retreats --

00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:21.822
many things which may
temporarily relieve stress,

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:25.751
but which don't actually eliminate
PTSD symptoms over the long term.

00:01:26.654 --> 00:01:28.011
But things have changed.

00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:33.607
And I am here to tell you
that we can now eliminate PTSD,

00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:35.458
not just manage the symptoms,

00:01:35.482 --> 00:01:37.030
and in huge numbers of veterans.

00:01:37.054 --> 00:01:40.032
Because new scientific research
has been able to show,

00:01:40.056 --> 00:01:42.434
objectively, repeatedly,

00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:45.933
which treatments actually
get rid of symptoms and which do not.

00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:47.605
Now as it turns out,

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:52.859
the best treatments for PTSD use
many of the very same training principles

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:56.735
that the military uses
in preparing its trainees for war.

00:01:58.227 --> 00:01:59.706
Now, making war --

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.559
this is something that we are good at.

00:02:02.993 --> 00:02:07.133
We humans have been making war
since before we were even fully human.

00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:11.470
And since then, we have gone
from using stone and sinew

00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:16.084
to developing the most sophisticated
and devastating weapon systems imaginable.

00:02:16.108 --> 00:02:18.443
And to enable our warriors
to use these weapons,

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:20.788
we employ the most cutting-edge
training methods.

00:02:20.812 --> 00:02:22.239
We are good at making war.

00:02:22.898 --> 00:02:25.885
And we are good at training
our warriors to fight.

00:02:26.687 --> 00:02:30.176
Yet, when we consider the experience
of the modern-day combat veteran,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.387
we begin to see that we
have not been as good

00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:35.031
at preparing them to come home.

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:36.649
Why is that?

00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:41.005
Well, our ancestors lived
immersed in conflict,

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:43.407
and they fought right where they lived.

00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:47.108
So until only very recently
in our evolutionary history,

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:50.024
there was hardly a need to learn
how to come home from war,

00:02:50.048 --> 00:02:52.174
because we never really did.

00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:54.619
But thankfully, today,

00:02:54.643 --> 00:02:57.658
most of humanity lives
in far more peaceful societies,

00:02:57.682 --> 00:03:01.661
and when there is conflict,
we, especially in the United States,

00:03:01.685 --> 00:03:05.182
now have the technology to put
our warriors through advanced training,

00:03:05.206 --> 00:03:08.023
drop them in to fight
anywhere on the globe

00:03:08.047 --> 00:03:09.506
and when they're done,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.555
jet them back to peacetime suburbia.

00:03:12.514 --> 00:03:16.372
But just imagine for a moment
what this must feel like.

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:19.084
I've spoken with veterans who've told me

00:03:19.108 --> 00:03:22.200
that one day they're in a brutal
firefight in Afghanistan

00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:25.099
where they saw carnage and death,

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:28.337
and just three days later,
they found themselves

00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:30.945
toting an ice chest
to their kid's soccer game.

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:35.170
"Mindfuck" is the most common term.

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:36.608
(Laughter)

00:03:36.632 --> 00:03:39.751
It's the most common term
I've heard to describe that experience.

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:41.299
And that's exactly what that is.

00:03:41.323 --> 00:03:45.312
Because while our warriors
spend countless hours training for war,

00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:47.229
we've only recently come to understand

00:03:47.253 --> 00:03:50.713
that many require training
on how to return to civilian life.

00:03:51.642 --> 00:03:55.733
Now, like any training, the best
PTSD treatments require repetition.

00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:56.908
In the military,

00:03:56.932 --> 00:04:00.172
we don't simply hand trainees
Mark-19 automatic grenade launchers

00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:03.388
and say, "Here's the trigger,
here's some ammo and good luck."

00:04:03.412 --> 00:04:08.108
No. We train them, on the range
and in specific contexts,

00:04:08.132 --> 00:04:09.818
over and over and over

00:04:09.842 --> 00:04:12.631
until lifting their weapon
and engaging their target

00:04:12.655 --> 00:04:14.491
is so engrained into muscle memory

00:04:14.515 --> 00:04:16.843
that it can be performed
without even thinking,

00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:19.787
even under the most stressful
conditions you can imagine.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.364
Now, the same holds
for training-based treatments.

00:04:23.875 --> 00:04:27.206
The first of these treatments
is cognitive therapy,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.599
and this is a kind
of mental recalibration.

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:32.795
When veterans come home from war,

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.415
their way of mentally framing
the world is calibrated

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.098
to an immensely
more dangerous environment.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.016
So when you try to overlay that mind frame
onto a peacetime environment,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.245
you get problems.

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:49.724
You begin drowning in worries
about dangers that aren't present.

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:53.071
You begin not trusting family or friends.

00:04:53.935 --> 00:04:57.999
Which is not to say there are no
dangers in civilian life; there are.

00:04:58.402 --> 00:05:01.094
It's just that the probability
of encountering them

00:05:01.118 --> 00:05:02.388
compared to combat

00:05:02.412 --> 00:05:04.720
is astronomically lower.

00:05:05.675 --> 00:05:08.815
So we never advise veterans
to turn off caution completely.

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:11.223
We do train them, however,
to adjust caution

00:05:11.247 --> 00:05:12.888
according to where they are.

00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:16.170
If you find yourself
in a bad neighborhood,

00:05:16.194 --> 00:05:17.449
you turn it up.

00:05:17.878 --> 00:05:19.527
Out to dinner with family?

00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:21.479
You turn it way down.

00:05:21.975 --> 00:05:24.747
We train veterans to be fiercely rational,

00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:28.825
to systematically gauge
the actual statistical probability

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.657
of encountering, say, an IED
here in peacetime America.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.724
With enough practice,
those recalibrations stick.

00:05:39.193 --> 00:05:41.507
The next of these treatments
is exposure therapy,

00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:43.958
and this is a kind of field training,

00:05:44.453 --> 00:05:47.514
and the fastest of the proven
effective treatments out there.

00:05:47.974 --> 00:05:49.531
You remember Carlos?

00:05:49.555 --> 00:05:51.422
This was the treatment that he chose.

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:54.309
And so we started off
by giving him exercises,

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:55.639
for him, challenging ones:

00:05:55.663 --> 00:05:57.609
going to a grocery store,

00:05:57.633 --> 00:06:00.258
going to a shopping mall,
going to a restaurant,

00:06:00.282 --> 00:06:02.772
sitting with his back to the door.

00:06:03.214 --> 00:06:04.399
And, critically --

00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:06.545
staying in these environments.

00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:09.501
Now, at first he was very anxious.

00:06:09.525 --> 00:06:12.017
He wanted to sit
where he could scan the room,

00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:13.966
where he could plan escape routes,

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.017
where he could get his hands
on a makeshift weapon.

00:06:17.041 --> 00:06:19.881
And he wanted to leave, but he didn't.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.261
He remembered his training
in the Marine Corps,

00:06:23.285 --> 00:06:25.129
and he pushed through his discomfort.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.722
And every time he did this,
his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit,

00:06:28.746 --> 00:06:31.505
and then a little bit more
and then a little bit more,

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:32.843
until in the end,

00:06:32.867 --> 00:06:37.777
he had effectively relearned
how to sit in a public space

00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:40.269
and just enjoy himself.

00:06:41.704 --> 00:06:45.022
He also listened to recordings
of his combat experiences,

00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:47.227
over and over and over.

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:51.946
He listened until those memories
no longer generated any anxiety.

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.981
He processed his memories so much

00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:58.234
that his brain no longer needed
to return to those experiences

00:06:58.258 --> 00:06:59.543
in his sleep.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.953
And when I spoke with him
a year after treatment had finished,

00:07:03.977 --> 00:07:05.348
he told me,

00:07:05.372 --> 00:07:09.773
"Doc, this is the first time in 43 years

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.058
that I haven't had nightmares."

00:07:13.412 --> 00:07:17.590
Now, this is different
than erasing a memory.

00:07:18.087 --> 00:07:21.082
Veterans will always remember
their traumatic experiences,

00:07:21.106 --> 00:07:22.763
but with enough practice,

00:07:22.787 --> 00:07:27.993
those memories are no longer as raw
or as painful as they once were.

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:31.940
They don't feel emotionally
like they just happened yesterday,

00:07:31.964 --> 00:07:35.770
and that is an immensely
better place to be.

00:07:37.985 --> 00:07:39.255
But it's often difficult.

00:07:39.677 --> 00:07:43.315
And, like any training,
it may not work for everybody.

00:07:44.117 --> 00:07:45.408
And there are trust issues.

00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:47.213
Sometimes I'm asked,

00:07:47.237 --> 00:07:49.891
"If you haven't been there, Doc,
how can you help me?"

00:07:49.915 --> 00:07:51.378
Which is understandable.

00:07:52.244 --> 00:07:56.615
But at the point of returning
to civilian life,

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:59.624
you do not require
somebody who's been there.

00:07:59.985 --> 00:08:03.101
You don't require training
for operations on the battlefield;

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:07.038
you require training on how to come home.

00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:12.891
For the past 10 years of my work,

00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:16.084
I have been exposed to detailed accounts

00:08:16.108 --> 00:08:18.708
of the worst experiences
that you can imagine,

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:19.961
daily.

00:08:19.985 --> 00:08:22.083
And it hasn't always been easy.

00:08:22.107 --> 00:08:25.472
There have been times
where I have just felt my heart break

00:08:25.496 --> 00:08:27.343
or that I've absorbed too much.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.473
But these training-based
treatments work so well,

00:08:31.497 --> 00:08:34.579
that whatever this work takes out of me,
it puts back even more,

00:08:34.603 --> 00:08:37.849
because I see people get better.

00:08:38.754 --> 00:08:40.577
I see people's lives transform.

00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:45.994
Carlos can now enjoy outings
with his grandchildren,

00:08:46.018 --> 00:08:49.225
which is something he couldn't even do
with his own children.

00:08:49.638 --> 00:08:53.624
And what's amazing to me
is that after 43 years of suffering,

00:08:53.648 --> 00:08:57.467
it only took him 10 weeks
of intense training to get his life back.

00:08:58.001 --> 00:09:00.309
And when I spoke with him, he told me,

00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:04.350
"I know that I can't get those years back.

00:09:05.088 --> 00:09:09.997
But at least now, whatever days
that I have left on this Earth,

00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:11.938
I can live them in peace."

00:09:13.114 --> 00:09:16.586
He also said, "I hope that these
younger veterans don't wait

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.958
to get the help they need."

00:09:18.588 --> 00:09:19.874
And that's my hope, too.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.206
Because ...

00:09:23.003 --> 00:09:24.446
this life is short,

00:09:25.383 --> 00:09:28.555
and if you are fortunate enough
to have survived war

00:09:28.579 --> 00:09:30.659
or any kind of traumatic experience,

00:09:30.683 --> 00:09:34.198
you owe it to yourself
to live your life well.

00:09:34.629 --> 00:09:37.270
And you shouldn't wait
to get the training you need

00:09:37.294 --> 00:09:38.679
to make that happen.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:45.978
Now, the best way of ending
human suffering caused by war

00:09:46.883 --> 00:09:48.383
is to never go to war.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.588
But we are just not there
yet as a species.

00:09:52.157 --> 00:09:53.417
Until we are,

00:09:53.441 --> 00:09:58.674
the mental suffering that we create
in our sons and in our daughters

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:00.246
when we send them off to fight

00:10:00.682 --> 00:10:02.932
can be alleviated.

00:10:03.675 --> 00:10:09.761
But we must ensure that the science,
the energy level, the value

00:10:09.785 --> 00:10:12.717
that we place on sending them off to war

00:10:13.516 --> 00:10:15.426
is at the very least mirrored

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.056
in how well we prepare them
to come back home to us.
