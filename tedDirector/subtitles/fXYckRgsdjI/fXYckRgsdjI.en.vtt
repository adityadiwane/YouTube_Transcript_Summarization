00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:22.306
Of the five senses, vision is the one
that I appreciate the most,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.306
and it's the one that I can
least take for granted.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.881
I think this is partially due
to my father, who was blind.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:32.008
It was a fact that he didn't make
much of a fuss about, usually.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:35.666
One time in Nova Scotia, when we went
to see a total eclipse of the sun --

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.708
(Laughter)

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:38.821
Yeah, same one as in the Carly Simon song,

00:00:38.845 --> 00:00:41.669
which may or may not refer
to James Taylor, Warren Beatty

00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:43.525
or Mick Jagger; we're not really sure.

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:46.085
They handed out these dark plastic viewers

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.158
that allowed us to look
directly at the sun

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:49.449
without damaging our eyes.

00:00:49.473 --> 00:00:52.209
But Dad got really scared;
he didn't want us doing that.

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:55.091
He wanted us instead to use
these cheap cardboard viewers,

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:58.775
so that there was no chance at all
that our eyes would be damaged.

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.069
I thought this was
a little strange at the time.

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:02.561
What I didn't know at the time

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:05.643
was that my father had actually
been born with perfect eyesight.

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:08.326
When he and his sister Martha
were just very little,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.828
their mom took them out
to see a total eclipse --

00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:12.383
or actually, a solar eclipse --

00:01:12.407 --> 00:01:15.964
and not long after that, both of them
started losing their eyesight.

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:20.174
Decades later, it turned out
that the source of their blindness

00:01:20.198 --> 00:01:23.006
was most likely some sort
of bacterial infection.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.661
As near as we can tell,
it had nothing whatsoever to do

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.608
with that solar eclipse,

00:01:27.632 --> 00:01:30.300
but by then my grandmother
had already gone to her grave

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:31.753
thinking it was her fault.

00:01:32.847 --> 00:01:35.824
So, Dad graduated Harvard in 1946,

00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:37.006
married my mom,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.261
and bought a house
in Lexington, Massachusetts,

00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:42.875
where the first shots were fired
against the British in 1775,

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.974
although we didn't actually hit
any of them until Concord.

00:01:45.998 --> 00:01:49.572
He got a job working for Raytheon
designing guidance systems,

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:52.648
which was part of the Route 128
high-tech axis in those days --

00:01:52.672 --> 00:01:55.107
so, the equivalent
of Silicon Valley in the '70s.

00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:58.272
Dad wasn't a real
militaristic kind of guy;

00:01:58.296 --> 00:02:01.441
he just felt bad that he wasn't able
to fight in World War II

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:03.115
on account of his handicap,

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:04.921
although they did let him get through

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:08.682
the several-hour-long army physical exam

00:02:08.706 --> 00:02:11.728
before they got to the very last test,
which was for vision.

00:02:11.752 --> 00:02:14.394
(Laughter)

00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:17.569
So Dad started racking
up all of these patents

00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:21.062
and gaining a reputation as a blind
genius, rocket scientist, inventor.

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:25.034
But to us he was just Dad,
and our home life was pretty normal.

00:02:25.673 --> 00:02:27.568
As a kid, I watched a lot of television

00:02:27.592 --> 00:02:31.230
and had lots of nerdy hobbies
like mineralogy and microbiology

00:02:31.254 --> 00:02:33.774
and the space program
and a little bit of politics.

00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:35.018
I played a lot of chess.

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:38.185
But at the age of 14, a friend
got me interested in comic books,

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.059
and I decided that was
what I wanted to do for a living.

00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:43.260
So, here's my dad:

00:02:43.284 --> 00:02:48.284
he's a scientist, he's an engineer
and he's a military contractor.

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:50.984
So, he has four kids, right?

00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:53.112
One grows up to become
a computer scientist,

00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:55.064
one grows up to join the Navy,

00:02:55.088 --> 00:02:57.330
one grows up to become an engineer ...

00:02:57.354 --> 00:03:00.314
And then there's me:
the comic book artist.

00:03:00.338 --> 00:03:04.068
(Laughter)

00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:06.780
Which, incidentally, makes me
the opposite of Dean Kamen,

00:03:06.804 --> 00:03:09.266
because I'm a comic book artist,
son of an inventor,

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.625
and he's an inventor,
son of a comic book artist.

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:12.878
(Laughter)

00:03:12.902 --> 00:03:14.065
Right? It's true.

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:16.743
(Applause)

00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:19.102
The funny thing is,
Dad had a lot of faith in me.

00:03:19.126 --> 00:03:21.278
He had faith in my abilities
as a cartoonist,

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:24.589
even though he had no direct evidence
that I was any good whatsoever;

00:03:24.613 --> 00:03:26.280
everything he saw was just a blur.

00:03:26.304 --> 00:03:29.016
Now, this gives a real meaning
to the term "blind faith,"

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.632
which doesn't have the same
negative connotation for me

00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:33.129
that it does for other people.

00:03:33.153 --> 00:03:36.297
Now, faith in things which cannot
be seen, which cannot be proved,

00:03:36.321 --> 00:03:40.046
is not the sort of faith that I've ever
really related to all that much.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.497
I tend to like science,

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:46.008
where what we see and can ascertain
are the foundation of what we know.

00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:49.109
But there's a middle ground, too --

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:52.688
a middle ground tread by people
like poor old Charles Babbage

00:03:52.712 --> 00:03:55.497
and his steam-driven computers
that were never built.

00:03:56.164 --> 00:03:59.213
Nobody really understood
what it was that he had in mind

00:03:59.237 --> 00:04:00.730
except for Ada Lovelace,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.598
and he went to his grave
trying to pursue that dream.

00:04:05.308 --> 00:04:07.704
Vannevar Bush with his memex --

00:04:07.728 --> 00:04:10.705
this idea of all of human
knowledge at your fingertips --

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:12.257
he had this vision.

00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.123
And I think a lot of people in his day

00:04:14.147 --> 00:04:16.086
probably thought he was a bit of a kook.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.525
And, yeah, we can look back
in retrospect and say,

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.770
"Yeah, ha-ha, it's all microfilm --

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:21.817
(Laughter)

00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:24.927
But that's not the point;
he understood the shape of the future.

00:04:24.951 --> 00:04:29.541
So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions
for computer-human interaction.

00:04:29.565 --> 00:04:32.434
Same thing: he understood
the shape of the future,

00:04:32.458 --> 00:04:36.060
even though it was something
that would only be implemented

00:04:36.084 --> 00:04:37.475
by people much later.

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:40.218
Or Paul Baran, and his vision
for packet switching.

00:04:40.242 --> 00:04:42.399
Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.

00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:45.293
Or even the people
who actually pulled it off,

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:47.927
the people at Bolt, Beranek
and Newman in Boston,

00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:50.863
who just would sketch out these structures

00:04:50.887 --> 00:04:53.423
of what would eventually
become a worldwide network,

00:04:53.447 --> 00:04:57.065
and sketching things on the back
of napkins and on note papers

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:59.387
and arguing over dinner
at Howard Johnson's --

00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:01.801
on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts,

00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:05.058
just two miles from where I was studying
the Queen's Gambit Deferred

00:05:05.082 --> 00:05:07.182
and listening to Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:09.374
singing "Midnight Train to Georgia" --

00:05:09.398 --> 00:05:10.401
(Laughter)

00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:12.267
in my dad's big easy chair, you know?

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:14.228
So, three types of vision, right?

00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:17.229
Vision based on what one cannot see,

00:05:17.253 --> 00:05:20.022
the vision of that unseen and unknowable.

00:05:20.046 --> 00:05:23.506
The vision of that which has already
been proven or can be ascertained.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:30.055
And this third kind, a vision of something
which can be, which may be,

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:33.081
based on knowledge
but is, as yet, unproven.

00:05:33.807 --> 00:05:35.861
Now, we've seen a lot
of examples of people

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:38.203
who are pursuing
that sort of vision in science,

00:05:38.227 --> 00:05:41.181
but I think it's also true
in the arts, it's true in politics,

00:05:41.205 --> 00:05:43.393
it's even true in personal endeavors.

00:05:43.417 --> 00:05:46.066
What it comes down to, really,
is four basic principles:

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.289
learn from everyone;

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:48.639
follow no one;

00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:50.548
watch for patterns;

00:05:50.989 --> 00:05:52.168
and work like hell.

00:05:52.192 --> 00:05:55.212
I think these are the four principles
that go into this.

00:05:55.236 --> 00:05:57.067
And it's that third one, especially,

00:05:57.091 --> 00:06:00.232
where visions of the future
begin to manifest themselves.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.134
What's interesting is that this particular
way of looking at the world,

00:06:04.158 --> 00:06:06.290
is, I think, only one
of four different ways

00:06:06.314 --> 00:06:09.030
that manifest themselves
in different fields of endeavor.

00:06:09.054 --> 00:06:13.537
In comics, I know that it results
in sort of a formalist attitude

00:06:13.561 --> 00:06:15.620
towards trying to understand how it works.

00:06:15.644 --> 00:06:17.875
Then there's another,
more classical attitude

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:20.482
which embraces beauty and craft;

00:06:20.506 --> 00:06:24.538
another one which believes
in the pure transparency of content;

00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:28.509
and then another, which emphasizes
the authenticity of human experience

00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:29.951
and honesty and rawness.

00:06:29.975 --> 00:06:32.779
These are four very different ways
of looking at the world.

00:06:32.803 --> 00:06:33.955
I even gave them names:

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.726
the classicist, the animist,
the formalist and iconoclast.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.290
Interestingly, they seem
to correspond more or less

00:06:39.314 --> 00:06:41.885
to Jung's four subdivisions
of human thought.

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.697
And they reflect a dichotomy
of art and delight

00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:45.936
on left and the right;

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.460
tradition and revolution
on the top and the bottom.

00:06:48.484 --> 00:06:51.127
And if you go on the diagonal,
you get content and form,

00:06:51.151 --> 00:06:52.392
and then beauty and truth.

00:06:52.416 --> 00:06:56.502
And it probably applies just as much
to music and movies and fine art,

00:06:56.526 --> 00:06:59.503
which has nothing whatsoever
to do with vision at all,

00:06:59.527 --> 00:07:02.408
or, for that matter, nothing to do
with our conference theme

00:07:02.432 --> 00:07:03.764
of "Inspired by Nature,"

00:07:03.788 --> 00:07:06.468
except to the extent
of the fable of the frog

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:09.760
who gives a ride to the scorpion
on his back to get across the river

00:07:09.784 --> 00:07:11.994
because the scorpion
promises not to sting him,

00:07:12.018 --> 00:07:14.552
but the scorpion stings him anyway
and they both die,

00:07:14.576 --> 00:07:17.465
but not before the frog asks
him why, and the scorpion says,

00:07:17.489 --> 00:07:18.688
"Because it's my nature."

00:07:18.712 --> 00:07:19.867
In that sense, yes.

00:07:19.891 --> 00:07:23.236
(Laughter)

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.490
So this was my nature.

00:07:24.514 --> 00:07:27.628
The thing was, I saw that the route I took

00:07:27.652 --> 00:07:31.497
to discovering this focus in my work

00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:33.365
and who I was --

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:35.616
I saw it as just this road to discovery.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.863
Actually, it was just me
embracing my nature,

00:07:37.887 --> 00:07:42.733
which means that I didn't actually fall
that far from the tree, after all.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.405
So what does a "scientific mind"
do in the arts?

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.261
I started making comics, but I also
started trying to understand them,

00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:53.436
almost immediately.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.542
One of the most important things
about comics that I discovered

00:07:56.566 --> 00:07:58.413
was that comics are a visual medium,

00:07:58.437 --> 00:08:01.281
but they try to embrace
all of the senses within it.

00:08:01.403 --> 00:08:05.470
So, the different elements
of comics, like pictures and words,

00:08:05.494 --> 00:08:08.012
and the different symbols
and everything in between

00:08:08.036 --> 00:08:09.223
that comics presents,

00:08:09.247 --> 00:08:11.815
are all funneled through
the single conduit, a vision.

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.816
So we have things like resemblance,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.080
where something which resembles
the physical world can be abstracted

00:08:17.104 --> 00:08:18.866
in a couple of different directions:

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.490
abstracted from resemblance,
but still retaining the complete meaning,

00:08:22.514 --> 00:08:25.231
or abstracted away
from both resemblance and meaning

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:26.511
towards the picture plane.

00:08:26.535 --> 00:08:29.369
Put all these three together,
and you have a nice little map

00:08:29.393 --> 00:08:31.508
of the entire boundary
of visual iconography,

00:08:31.532 --> 00:08:33.317
which comics can embrace.

00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:36.179
And if you move to the right
you also get language,

00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:39.180
because that's abstracting
even further from resemblance,

00:08:39.204 --> 00:08:41.204
but still maintaining meaning.

00:08:41.807 --> 00:08:44.557
Vision is called upon to represent sound

00:08:44.581 --> 00:08:48.152
and to understand
the common properties of those two

00:08:48.176 --> 00:08:50.316
and their common heritage as well;

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.725
also, to try to represent
the texture of sound

00:08:52.749 --> 00:08:56.465
to capture its essential
character through visuals.

00:08:57.466 --> 00:09:01.573
There's also a balance between the visible
and the invisible in comics.

00:09:02.489 --> 00:09:04.386
Comics is a kind of call and response,

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.552
in which the artist gives you something
to see within the panels,

00:09:07.576 --> 00:09:10.578
and then gives you something
to imagine between the panels.

00:09:11.355 --> 00:09:15.620
Also, another sense
which comics' vision represents,

00:09:15.644 --> 00:09:16.929
and that's time.

00:09:17.314 --> 00:09:20.231
Sequence is a very important
aspect of comics.

00:09:20.982 --> 00:09:23.093
Comics presents a kind of temporal map.

00:09:24.276 --> 00:09:27.912
And this temporal map was something
that energizes modern comics,

00:09:27.936 --> 00:09:30.857
but I was wondering
if perhaps it also energizes

00:09:30.881 --> 00:09:32.399
other sorts of forms,

00:09:32.423 --> 00:09:33.855
and I found some in history.

00:09:34.936 --> 00:09:37.620
You can see this same principle operating

00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:40.628
in these ancient versions
of the same idea.

00:09:40.652 --> 00:09:41.805
What's happening is,

00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:44.171
an art form is colliding
with a given technology,

00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:45.536
whether it's paint on stone,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.957
like the Tomb of Menna the Scribe
in ancient Egypt,

00:09:47.981 --> 00:09:50.585
or a bas-relief sculpture
rising up a stone column,

00:09:50.609 --> 00:09:52.637
or a 200-foot-long embroidery,

00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:54.638
or painted deerskin and tree bark

00:09:54.662 --> 00:09:57.100
running across 88 accordion-folded pages.

00:09:57.124 --> 00:09:59.289
What's interesting is,
once you hit "print" --

00:09:59.313 --> 00:10:01.170
and this is from 1450, by the way --

00:10:01.194 --> 00:10:04.327
all of the artifacts of modern comics
start to present themselves:

00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:05.867
rectilinear panel arrangements,

00:10:05.891 --> 00:10:07.659
simple line drawings without tone,

00:10:07.683 --> 00:10:09.681
and a left-to-right reading sequence.

00:10:11.093 --> 00:10:16.101
And within 100 years, you already start
to see word balloons and captions,

00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:19.086
and it's really just a hop, skip
and a jump from here to here.

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:23.274
So I wrote a book about this in '93,
but as I was finishing the book,

00:10:23.298 --> 00:10:25.214
I had to do a little bit of typesetting,

00:10:25.238 --> 00:10:27.906
and I was tired of going
to my local copy shop to do it,

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.175
so I bought a computer.

00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:30.873
And it was just a little thing --

00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:33.063
it wasn't good for much
except text entry --

00:10:33.087 --> 00:10:36.927
but my father had told me
about Moore's law back in the '70s,

00:10:36.951 --> 00:10:38.428
and I knew what was coming.

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:41.577
And so, I kept my eyes peeled

00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:43.642
to see if the sort
of changes that happened

00:10:43.666 --> 00:10:46.276
when we went from pre-print
comics to print comics

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.174
would happen when we went beyond,
to post-print comics.

00:10:49.665 --> 00:10:51.413
So, one of the first things proposed

00:10:51.437 --> 00:10:53.791
was that we could mix
the visuals of comics

00:10:53.815 --> 00:10:56.626
with the sound, motion
and interactivity of the CD-ROMs

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:57.856
being made in those days.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.459
This was even before the Web.

00:10:59.483 --> 00:11:01.444
And one of the first things they did was,

00:11:01.468 --> 00:11:03.379
they tried to take the comics page as is

00:11:03.403 --> 00:11:04.863
and transplant it to monitors,

00:11:04.887 --> 00:11:06.888
which was a classic McLuhanesque mistake

00:11:06.912 --> 00:11:09.411
of appropriating the shape
of the previous technology

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:11.496
as the content of the new technology.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.000
And so, what they would do
is have these comic pages

00:11:14.024 --> 00:11:15.659
that resemble print comics pages,

00:11:15.683 --> 00:11:18.099
and they would introduce
all this sound and motion.

00:11:18.123 --> 00:11:21.364
The problem was that if you go
with this basic idea

00:11:21.388 --> 00:11:23.736
that space equals time in comics,

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.475
what happens is that
when you introduce sound and motion,

00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:29.898
which are temporal phenomena
that can only be represented through time,

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:34.226
they break with that continuity
of presentation.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.692
Interactivity was another thing.

00:11:36.716 --> 00:11:39.483
There were hypertext comics,
but the thing about hypertext

00:11:39.507 --> 00:11:42.216
is that everything in hypertext
is either here, not here,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.398
or connected to here;

00:11:43.422 --> 00:11:44.772
it's profoundly nonspatial.

00:11:44.796 --> 00:11:47.249
The distance from Abraham Lincoln
to a Lincoln penny

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:50.358
to Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan
to "Plan 9" to nine lives:

00:11:50.382 --> 00:11:51.533
it's all the same.

00:11:51.557 --> 00:11:52.750
(Laughter)

00:11:52.774 --> 00:11:55.626
But in comics,

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.520
every aspect of the work,
every element of the work,

00:11:58.544 --> 00:12:01.679
has a spatial relationship
to every other element at all times.

00:12:01.703 --> 00:12:02.871
So the question was:

00:12:02.895 --> 00:12:05.872
Was there any way to preserve
that spatial relationship

00:12:05.896 --> 00:12:08.244
while still taking advantage
of all of the things

00:12:08.268 --> 00:12:09.911
that digital had to offer us?

00:12:09.935 --> 00:12:11.966
And I found my personal answer for this

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.300
in those ancient comics
that I was showing you.

00:12:14.324 --> 00:12:17.664
Each of them has a single
unbroken reading line,

00:12:17.688 --> 00:12:21.381
whether it's going zigzag across the walls
or spiraling up a column

00:12:21.405 --> 00:12:22.933
or just straight left to right,

00:12:22.957 --> 00:12:27.006
or even going in a backwards zigzag
across those 88 accordion-folded pages,

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.424
the same thing is happening;

00:12:28.448 --> 00:12:31.234
that is, that the basic idea
that as you move through space

00:12:31.258 --> 00:12:32.413
you move through time,

00:12:32.437 --> 00:12:34.521
is being carried out
without any compromise,

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:36.576
but there were compromises when print hit.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.516
Adjacent spaces were no longer
adjacent moments,

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.759
so the basic idea of comics
was being broken again and again

00:12:42.783 --> 00:12:43.939
and again and again.

00:12:43.963 --> 00:12:46.289
And I thought, OK, well, if that's true,

00:12:46.313 --> 00:12:49.220
is there any way,
when we go beyond today's print,

00:12:49.244 --> 00:12:51.004
to somehow bring that back?

00:12:52.395 --> 00:12:57.632
Now, the monitor is just as limited
as the page, technically, right?

00:12:57.656 --> 00:12:59.783
It's a different shape,
but other than that,

00:12:59.807 --> 00:13:01.712
it's the same basic limitation.

00:13:01.736 --> 00:13:04.736
But that's only if you look
at the monitor as a page,

00:13:05.299 --> 00:13:07.659
but not if you look
at the monitor as a window.

00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:09.268
And that's what I propose,

00:13:09.292 --> 00:13:12.409
that perhaps we could create
these comics on an infinite canvas,

00:13:12.433 --> 00:13:15.343
along the X axis and the Y axis

00:13:15.367 --> 00:13:16.627
and staircases.

00:13:17.164 --> 00:13:20.070
We could do circular narratives
that were literally circular.

00:13:20.094 --> 00:13:23.156
We could do a turn in a story
that was literally a turn.

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:25.972
Parallel narratives
could be literally parallel.

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.024
X, Y and also Z.

00:13:30.569 --> 00:13:31.891
So I had all these notions.

00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:33.423
This was back in the late '90s,

00:13:33.447 --> 00:13:36.278
and other people in my business
thought I was pretty crazy,

00:13:36.302 --> 00:13:38.827
but a lot of people then went on
and actually did it.

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:40.574
I'm going to show you a couple now.

00:13:41.093 --> 00:13:44.605
This was an early collage comic
by a fellow named Jasen Lex.

00:13:47.966 --> 00:13:49.741
And notice what's going on here.

00:13:49.765 --> 00:13:52.285
What I'm searching for
is a durable mutation --

00:13:52.309 --> 00:13:54.286
that's what all of us are searching for.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.490
As media head into this new era,

00:13:57.514 --> 00:14:00.006
we are looking for mutations
that are durable,

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.623
that have some sort of staying power.

00:14:03.567 --> 00:14:07.671
Now, we're taking this basic idea
of presenting comics in a visual medium,

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:11.006
and we're carrying it through all the way
from beginning to end.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.201
That's that entire comic you just saw,
up on the screen right now.

00:14:14.225 --> 00:14:17.284
But even though we're only experiencing it
one piece at a time,

00:14:17.308 --> 00:14:19.890
that's just where
the technology is right now.

00:14:19.914 --> 00:14:21.652
As the technology evolves,

00:14:21.676 --> 00:14:24.660
as you get full immersive
displays and whatnot,

00:14:24.684 --> 00:14:27.454
this sort of thing
will only grow; it will adapt.

00:14:27.478 --> 00:14:33.031
It will adapt to its environment;
it's a durable mutation.

00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:34.220
Here's another one.

00:14:34.244 --> 00:14:36.541
This is by Drew Weing; this is called

00:14:36.565 --> 00:14:39.580
"'Pup' Ponders the Heat Death
of the Universe."

00:15:04.392 --> 00:15:05.884
See what's going on here

00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:09.909
as we draw these stories
on an infinite canvas

00:15:12.165 --> 00:15:17.313
is you're creating a more pure expression
of what this medium is all about.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.563
We'll go by this a little quickly.
You get the idea.

00:15:24.587 --> 00:15:26.587
I just want to get to the last panel.

00:15:32.375 --> 00:15:35.471
[Cat 1: Pup! Earth to Pup!
Cat 2: Come play baseball with us!]

00:15:35.495 --> 00:15:36.558
(Laughter)

00:15:36.582 --> 00:15:38.182
[Pup: Did either of you realize

00:15:38.206 --> 00:15:41.501
that eventually the universe
will be nothing but a thin, cold gas

00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:43.485
spread across infinite, lonely space?]

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:46.131
[Cat 1: Oh ...
Cat 2: We'd better hurry, then!]

00:15:46.155 --> 00:15:48.155
(Laughter)

00:15:49.847 --> 00:15:50.997
Just one more.

00:15:53.474 --> 00:15:55.419
Talk about your infinite canvas.

00:15:55.443 --> 00:15:58.230
It's by a guy named
Daniel Merlin Goodbrey, in Britain.

00:15:58.593 --> 00:15:59.990
Why is this important?

00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:03.561
I think this is important because media --

00:16:04.727 --> 00:16:06.069
all media --

00:16:06.093 --> 00:16:08.404
provide us a window back into our world.

00:16:08.898 --> 00:16:13.220
Now, it could be that motion pictures
and eventually, virtual reality,

00:16:13.244 --> 00:16:16.423
or something equivalent to it,
some sort of immersive display,

00:16:16.447 --> 00:16:20.564
is going to provide us
with our most efficient escape

00:16:20.588 --> 00:16:22.006
from the world that we're in.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.810
That's why most people turn
to storytelling, to escape.

00:16:24.834 --> 00:16:31.227
But media provides us with a window
back into the world we live in.

00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:34.728
And when media evolve

00:16:34.752 --> 00:16:39.729
so that the identity of the media
becomes increasingly unique --

00:16:39.753 --> 00:16:42.953
because what you're looking at
is comics cubed,

00:16:42.977 --> 00:16:45.352
you're looking at comics
that are more comics-like

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:46.971
than they've ever been before --

00:16:46.995 --> 00:16:49.647
when that happens, you provide
people with multiple ways

00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:53.649
of reentering the world
through different windows.

00:16:53.673 --> 00:16:57.440
And when you do that, it allows them
to triangulate the world they live in

00:16:57.464 --> 00:16:58.839
and see its shape.

00:16:58.863 --> 00:17:00.640
That's why I think this is important.

00:17:00.664 --> 00:17:02.719
One of many reasons,
but I've got to go now.

00:17:02.743 --> 00:17:03.893
Thank you for having me.
