00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.906
I want us to start
by thinking about this device,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.984
the phone that's very likely
in your pockets right now.

00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:22.680
Over 40 percent of Americans 
check their phones

00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:25.934
within five minutes
of waking up every morning.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.683
And then they look at it
another 50 times during the day.

00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:33.544
Grownups consider this device
to be a necessity.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.708
But now I want you to imagine it
in the hands of a three-year-old,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.386
and as a society, we get anxious.

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:44.163
Parents are very worried

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:47.666
that this device is going to stunt
their children's social growth;

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.355
that it's going to keep them
from getting up and moving;

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.751
that somehow,

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:54.666
this is going to disrupt childhood.

00:00:56.102 --> 00:00:59.439
So, I want to challenge this attitude.

00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:02.295
I can envision a future

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:07.220
where we would be excited to see
a preschooler interacting with a screen.

00:01:08.347 --> 00:01:12.822
These screens can get kids
up and moving even more.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.064
They have the power to tell us more
about what a child is learning

00:01:17.088 --> 00:01:18.935
than a standardized test can.

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:20.915
And here's the really crazy thought:

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.748
I believe that these screens
have the power

00:01:23.772 --> 00:01:26.481
to prompt more real-life conversations

00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:28.763
between kids and their parents.

00:01:30.302 --> 00:01:33.588
Now, I was perhaps
an unlikely champion for this cause.

00:01:33.612 --> 00:01:35.573
I studied children's literature

00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:38.131
because I was going to work
with kids and books.

00:01:38.654 --> 00:01:40.755
But about 20 years ago,

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:43.947
I had an experience that shifted my focus.

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:48.558
I was helping lead a research study
about preschoolers and websites.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.341
And I walked in and was assigned
a three-year-old named Maria.

00:01:52.793 --> 00:01:56.688
Maria had actually never seen
a computer before.

00:01:56.712 --> 00:01:59.858
So the first thing I had to do
was teach her how to use the mouse,

00:01:59.882 --> 00:02:05.312
and when I opened up the screen,
she moved it across the screen,

00:02:05.336 --> 00:02:08.571
and she stopped on a character
named X the Owl.

00:02:09.103 --> 00:02:10.349
And when she did that,

00:02:10.373 --> 00:02:14.165
the owl lifted his wing and waved at her.

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.562
Maria dropped the mouse,
pushed back from the table, leaped up

00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:20.370
and started waving
frantically back at him.

00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:24.066
Her connection to that character

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.360
was visceral.

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:28.163
This wasn't a passive screen experience.

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.753
This was a human experience.

00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:35.106
And it was exactly appropriate
for a three-year-old.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.795
I've now worked at PBS Kids
for more than 15 years,

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.440
and my work there is focused on
harnessing the power of technology

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:48.126
as a positive in children's lives.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.612
I believe that as a society,
we're missing a big opportunity.

00:02:51.636 --> 00:02:53.879
We're letting our fear and our skepticism

00:02:53.903 --> 00:02:55.336
about these devices

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.872
hold us back from realizing
their potential

00:02:57.896 --> 00:02:59.321
in our children's lives.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.706
Fear about kids and technology
is nothing new;

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.364
we've been here before.

00:03:05.388 --> 00:03:10.105
Over 50 years ago, the debate was raging
about the newly dominant media:

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.804
the television.

00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:13.828
That box in the living room?

00:03:13.852 --> 00:03:16.498
It might be separating kids
from one another.

00:03:16.522 --> 00:03:19.169
It might keep them away
from the outside world.

00:03:20.344 --> 00:03:23.386
But this is the moment when Fred Rogers,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.493
the long-running host
of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,"

00:03:26.517 --> 00:03:31.247
challenged society
to look at television as a tool,

00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:33.990
a tool that could promote
emotional growth.

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:35.197
Here's what he did:

00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:38.919
he looked out from the screen,
and he held a conversation,

00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:43.863
as if he were speaking
to each child individually

00:03:43.887 --> 00:03:45.629
about feelings.

00:03:45.653 --> 00:03:46.948
And then he would pause

00:03:47.883 --> 00:03:49.575
and let them think about them.

00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:54.759
You can see his influence
across the media landscape today,

00:03:54.783 --> 00:03:57.770
but at the time, this was revolutionary.

00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:03.130
He shifted the way we looked at television
in the lives of children.

00:04:04.923 --> 00:04:07.570
Today it's not just one box.

00:04:07.594 --> 00:04:10.113
Kids are surrounded by devices.

00:04:10.137 --> 00:04:14.706
And I'm also a parent -- I understand
this feeling of anxiety.

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.905
But I want us to look
at three common fears

00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:20.442
that parents have,

00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:23.310
and see if we can shift our focus

00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:25.965
to the opportunity that's in each of them.

00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:27.844
So.

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:29.219
Fear number one:

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.428
"Screens are passive.

00:04:31.452 --> 00:04:34.487
This is going to keep our kids
from getting up and moving."

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:39.228
Chris Kratt and Martin Kratt
are zoologist brothers

00:04:39.252 --> 00:04:42.184
who host a show about animals
called "Wild Kratts."

00:04:42.707 --> 00:04:45.070
And they approached the PBS team to say,

00:04:45.094 --> 00:04:47.257
"Can we do something with those cameras

00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:49.582
that are built into every device now?

00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:54.291
Could those cameras capture
a very natural kid play pattern --

00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:56.315
pretending to be animals?"

00:04:57.084 --> 00:04:59.084
So we started with bats.

00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:02.503
And when kids came in to play this game,

00:05:02.527 --> 00:05:05.488
they loved seeing themselves
on-screen with wings.

00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:07.709
But my favorite part of this,

00:05:07.733 --> 00:05:11.025
when the game was over
and we turned off the screens?

00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:12.962
The kids kept being bats.

00:05:12.986 --> 00:05:14.923
They kept flying around the room,

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:18.012
they kept veering left and right
to catch mosquitoes.

00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:20.293
And they remembered things.

00:05:20.991 --> 00:05:23.843
They remembered that bats fly at night.

00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:26.749
And they remembered that when bats sleep,

00:05:26.773 --> 00:05:29.258
they hang upside down
and fold their wings in.

00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:33.059
This game definitely got kids
up and moving.

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.859
But also, now when kids go outside,

00:05:36.883 --> 00:05:39.080
do they look at a bird and think,

00:05:39.104 --> 00:05:41.844
"How does a bird fly
differently than I flew

00:05:41.868 --> 00:05:43.075
when I was a bat?"

00:05:44.447 --> 00:05:47.750
The digital technology prompted
embodied learning

00:05:47.774 --> 00:05:50.405
that kids can now take out into the world.

00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:54.573
Fear number two:

00:05:55.747 --> 00:05:58.819
"Playing games on these screens
is just a waste of time.

00:05:58.843 --> 00:06:01.645
It's going to distract children
from their education."

00:06:03.827 --> 00:06:05.228
Game developers know

00:06:05.252 --> 00:06:07.662
that you can learn a lot
about a player's skill

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:09.764
by looking at the back-end data:

00:06:09.788 --> 00:06:12.102
Where did a player pause?

00:06:12.126 --> 00:06:15.772
Where did they make a few mistakes
before they found the right answer?

00:06:15.796 --> 00:06:20.155
My team wanted to take that tool set
and apply it to academic learning.

00:06:21.234 --> 00:06:24.235
Our producer in Boston, WGBH,

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.982
created a series of Curious George games

00:06:27.006 --> 00:06:28.555
focused on math.

00:06:29.428 --> 00:06:35.211
And researchers came in and had
80 preschoolers play these games.

00:06:35.235 --> 00:06:37.799
They then gave all 80
of those preschoolers

00:06:37.823 --> 00:06:39.766
a standardized math test.

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:41.604
We could see early on

00:06:41.628 --> 00:06:43.756
that these games
were actually helping kids

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.780
understand some key skills.

00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:49.633
But our partners at UCLA
wanted us to dig deeper.

00:06:50.164 --> 00:06:53.651
They focus on data analysis
and student assessment.

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:57.667
And they wanted to take
that back-end game-play data

00:06:57.691 --> 00:07:01.864
and see if they could use it
to predict a child's math scores.

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:05.538
So they made a neural net --
they essentially trained the computer

00:07:05.562 --> 00:07:07.084
to use this data,

00:07:07.108 --> 00:07:08.608
and here are the results.

00:07:08.632 --> 00:07:12.562
This is a subset of the children's
standardized math scores.

00:07:13.244 --> 00:07:14.414
And this

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:18.936
is the computer's prediction
of each child's score,

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.978
based on playing
some Curious George games.

00:07:23.508 --> 00:07:25.918
The prediction is astonishingly accurate,

00:07:25.942 --> 00:07:28.954
especially considering the fact
that these games weren't built

00:07:28.978 --> 00:07:30.183
for assessment.

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:33.689
The team that did this study
believes that games like these

00:07:33.713 --> 00:07:37.398
can teach us more
about a child's cognitive learning

00:07:37.422 --> 00:07:39.422
than a standardized test can.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.795
What if games could reduce
testing time in the classroom?

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:47.492
What if they could reduce testing anxiety?

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.845
How could they give teachers
snapshots of insight

00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:54.975
to help them better focus
their individualized learning?

00:07:57.967 --> 00:08:00.872
So the third fear I want to address

00:08:00.896 --> 00:08:03.880
is the one that I think
is often the biggest.

00:08:03.904 --> 00:08:05.086
And that's this:

00:08:05.911 --> 00:08:09.569
"These screens are isolating me
from my child."

00:08:10.831 --> 00:08:12.942
Let's play out a scenario.

00:08:12.966 --> 00:08:15.679
Let's say that you are a parent,

00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:18.701
and you need 25 minutes
of uninterrupted time

00:08:18.725 --> 00:08:20.283
to get dinner ready.

00:08:20.307 --> 00:08:23.966
And in order to do that,
you hand a tablet to your three-year-old.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.967
Now, this is a moment
where you probably feel very guilty

00:08:26.991 --> 00:08:28.390
about what you just did.

00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:31.565
But now imagine this:

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:34.639
Twenty minutes later,
you receive a text message.

00:08:34.663 --> 00:08:37.637
on that cell phone
that's always within arm's reach.

00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:42.199
And it says: "Alex just matched
five rhyming words.

00:08:42.223 --> 00:08:44.066
Ask him to play this game with you.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.914
Can you think of a word
that rhymes with 'cat'?

00:08:47.763 --> 00:08:49.354
Or how about 'ball'?"

00:08:50.617 --> 00:08:54.344
In our studies, when parents receive
simple tips like these,

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:56.013
they felt empowered.

00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:57.647
They were so excited

00:08:57.671 --> 00:09:00.295
to play these games
at the dinner table with their kids.

00:09:00.319 --> 00:09:01.921
And the kids loved it, too.

00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:04.860
Not only did it feel like magic
that their parents knew

00:09:04.884 --> 00:09:06.447
what they had been playing,

00:09:06.471 --> 00:09:09.766
kids love to play games
with their parents.

00:09:10.996 --> 00:09:14.927
Just the act of talking to kids
about their media

00:09:14.951 --> 00:09:16.951
can be incredibly powerful.

00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:20.974
Last summer, Texas Tech University
published a study

00:09:20.998 --> 00:09:24.360
that the show "Daniel Tiger's
Neighborhood" could promote

00:09:24.384 --> 00:09:27.776
the development of empathy among children.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.599
But there was a really important
catch to this study:

00:09:30.623 --> 00:09:35.080
the greatest benefit was only
when parents talked to kids

00:09:35.104 --> 00:09:36.990
about what they watched.

00:09:37.014 --> 00:09:39.014
Neither just watching

00:09:39.038 --> 00:09:41.038
nor just talking about it was enough;

00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:43.320
it was the combination that was key.

00:09:45.034 --> 00:09:46.487
So when I read this study,

00:09:46.511 --> 00:09:47.915
I started thinking about

00:09:47.939 --> 00:09:53.192
how rarely parents of preschoolers
actually talk to kids about the content

00:09:53.216 --> 00:09:55.602
of what they're playing
and what they're watching.

00:09:55.626 --> 00:09:58.089
And so I decided to try it
with my four-year-old.

00:09:58.113 --> 00:09:59.271
I said,

00:09:59.897 --> 00:10:02.726
"Were you playing a car game
earlier today?"

00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:05.154
And Benjamin perked up and said,

00:10:05.178 --> 00:10:09.023
"Yes! And did you see
that I made my car out of a pickle?

00:10:09.047 --> 00:10:11.134
It was really hard to open the trunk."

00:10:11.158 --> 00:10:12.816
(Laughter)

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.925
This hilarious conversation
about what was fun in the game

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.460
and what could have been better

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:21.264
continued all the way
to school that morning.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.735
I'm not here to suggest to you
that all digital media is great for kids.

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:32.445
There are legitimate reasons
for us to be concerned

00:10:32.469 --> 00:10:34.928
about the current state
of children's content

00:10:34.952 --> 00:10:36.196
on these screens.

00:10:36.882 --> 00:10:39.657
And it's right for us
to be thinking about balance:

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:43.341
Where do screens fit
against all the other things

00:10:43.365 --> 00:10:46.459
that a child needs to do
to learn and to grow?

00:10:48.078 --> 00:10:50.885
But when we fixate on our fears about it,

00:10:50.909 --> 00:10:53.693
we forget a really major point,

00:10:53.717 --> 00:10:57.915
and that is, that kids are living
in the same world that we live in,

00:10:57.939 --> 00:11:00.624
the world where the grownups
check their phones

00:11:00.648 --> 00:11:02.539
more than 50 times a day.

00:11:03.706 --> 00:11:06.512
Screens are a part of children's lives.

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:10.868
And if we pretend that they aren't,

00:11:10.892 --> 00:11:13.887
or if we get overwhelmed by our fear,

00:11:13.911 --> 00:11:18.320
kids are never going to learn
how and why to use them.

00:11:19.725 --> 00:11:22.990
What if we start raising our expectations

00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:24.366
for this media?

00:11:24.945 --> 00:11:27.218
What if we start talking to kids regularly

00:11:27.242 --> 00:11:29.363
about the content on these screens?

00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:32.875
What if we start looking
for the positive impacts

00:11:33.494 --> 00:11:36.693
that this technology can have
in our children's lives?

00:11:38.042 --> 00:11:42.387
That's when the potential of these tools
can become a reality.

00:11:43.164 --> 00:11:44.359
Thank you.

00:11:44.383 --> 00:11:47.883
(Applause)
