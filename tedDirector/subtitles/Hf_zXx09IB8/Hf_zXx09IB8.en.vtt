00:00:13.098 --> 00:00:14.477
"Look at me!"

00:00:16.496 --> 00:00:21.121
That phrase turned me
into an eye-contact coach.

00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:25.559
I'm the mother of Ivan; he's 15 years old.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.283
Ivan has autism,

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:29.852
he doesn't speak,

00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:31.866
and he communicates through an iPad,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.762
where his whole universe of words
exists in images.

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:42.309
He was diagnosed
when he was two and a half.

00:00:43.527 --> 00:00:47.540
I still remember that day painfully.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.032
My husband and I felt really lost;

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.487
we didn't know where to begin.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.185
There was no internet,

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.639
you couldn't Google information,

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:04.502
so we made those first steps

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.565
out of sheer intuition.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.759
Ivan would not maintain eye contact,

00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:15.080
he had lost the words that he did know,

00:01:16.104 --> 00:01:20.081
and he didn't respond to his name
or to anything we asked him,

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:23.176
as if words were noise.

00:01:25.287 --> 00:01:29.195
The only way I could know

00:01:29.837 --> 00:01:31.455
what was going on with him,

00:01:32.123 --> 00:01:33.622
what he felt,

00:01:34.157 --> 00:01:36.016
was looking him in the eye.

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:39.782
But that bridge was broken.

00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:44.872
How could I teach him about life?

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:51.247
When I did things he liked,
he would look at me,

00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:52.805
and we were connected.

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:57.273
So I dedicated myself
to working with him on those things,

00:01:57.297 --> 00:02:01.626
so we would have more and more
eye-contact moments.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.631
We would spend hours and hours playing tag
with his older sister, Alexia,

00:02:10.322 --> 00:02:12.939
and when we said: "I caught you!"

00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:15.700
he would look around for us,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.529
and at that moment,
I could feel he was alive.

00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:29.835
We also hold a record for hours spent
in a swimming pool.

00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:34.358
Ivan always had a passion for water.

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:38.511
I remember when he was two and a half,

00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:42.881
on a rainy winter day,

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:45.381
I was taking him to an indoor pool,

00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:48.055
because even on rainy days
we'd go swimming.

00:02:49.643 --> 00:02:53.331
We were on the highway,
and I took the wrong exit.

00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:58.057
He burst into tears and cried
inconsolably, nonstop,

00:02:58.081 --> 00:02:59.601
until I turned back.

00:03:00.356 --> 00:03:01.978
Only then did he calm down.

00:03:03.348 --> 00:03:07.044
How was it possible
that a two and a half year old

00:03:07.068 --> 00:03:08.875
didn't respond to his own name,

00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:13.795
yet in the middle of the rain and fog,
where I couldn't see anything,

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.125
he knew the exact route?

00:03:20.886 --> 00:03:24.326
That's when I realized that Ivan
had an exceptional visual memory,

00:03:25.362 --> 00:03:28.762
and that that would be my way in.

00:03:29.647 --> 00:03:32.017
So I started taking
pictures of everything,

00:03:32.688 --> 00:03:34.834
and teaching him what life was like,

00:03:34.858 --> 00:03:38.448
showing it to him, picture by picture.

00:03:39.578 --> 00:03:44.276
Even now, it's the way Ivan communicates

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.662
what he wants,

00:03:46.131 --> 00:03:47.410
what he needs

00:03:48.212 --> 00:03:50.602
and also what he feels.

00:03:53.843 --> 00:03:57.042
But it wasn't just
Ivan's eye contact that mattered.

00:03:58.752 --> 00:04:00.716
Everyone else's did, too.

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:06.545
How could I make people see
not only his autism,

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:07.965
but see him the person

00:04:09.132 --> 00:04:10.801
and everything he can give;

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:13.882
everything he can do;

00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:17.845
the things he likes and doesn't like,

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:19.709
just like any one of us?

00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:24.201
But for that, I also had
to give of myself.

00:04:25.614 --> 00:04:27.661
I had to have the strength to let him go,

00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:30.775
which was extremely difficult.

00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:34.587
Ivan was 11 years old,

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:39.265
and he went for treatment
in a neighborhood near our house.

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:44.044
One afternoon,
while I was waiting for him,

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:46.019
I went into a greengrocer,

00:04:46.043 --> 00:04:49.312
a typical neighborhood store
with a little bit of everything.

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:51.800
While doing the shopping,

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:55.034
I started talking to Jose, the owner.

00:04:56.762 --> 00:04:58.145
I told him about Ivan,

00:04:58.877 --> 00:05:00.233
that he had autism,

00:05:01.257 --> 00:05:05.525
and that I wanted him to learn
to walk down the street by himself,

00:05:05.549 --> 00:05:07.649
without anyone holding his hand.

00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:12.361
So I decided to ask Jose
if Thursdays around 2pm,

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:17.078
Ivan could come and help him arrange
the water bottles on the shelves,

00:05:17.102 --> 00:05:19.417
because he loved to organize things.

00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:23.207
And as a reward, he could buy
some chocolate cookies,

00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:24.977
which were his favorite.

00:05:27.663 --> 00:05:29.163
He said "yes" right away.

00:05:30.635 --> 00:05:33.877
So that's how it went for a year:

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:36.191
Ivan would go to Jose's greengrocer,

00:05:37.132 --> 00:05:40.576
help him arrange the shelves
of water bottles

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.863
with the labels perfectly
lined up on the same side,

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:49.494
and he would leave happy
with his chocolate cookies.

00:05:55.874 --> 00:05:58.294
Jose is not an expert in autism.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.922
There is no need to be an expert

00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:08.820
nor do anything heroic to include someone.

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.900
We just need to be there --

00:06:14.335 --> 00:06:15.907
(Applause)

00:06:22.762 --> 00:06:24.334
(Applause ends)

00:06:25.557 --> 00:06:27.074
Really, no heroic deed --

00:06:28.797 --> 00:06:31.089
we simply need to be close.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.444
And if we are afraid of something

00:06:36.331 --> 00:06:38.515
or we don't understand something,

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:39.788
we need to ask.

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:42.682
Let's be curious

00:06:44.182 --> 00:06:47.342
but never indifferent.

00:06:50.037 --> 00:06:53.587
Let's have the courage
to look each other in the eye,

00:06:56.206 --> 00:06:58.308
because by looking,

00:06:58.332 --> 00:07:01.405
we can open a whole world to someone else.

00:07:02.962 --> 00:07:05.360
(Applause)

00:07:05.384 --> 00:07:07.708
(Cheers)
