00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:14.601
Look, I had second thoughts, really,

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.636
about whether I could talk about this

00:00:16.636 --> 00:00:19.676
to such a vital and alive audience as you guys.

00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:22.266
Then I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem,

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.905
which goes,

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:25.836
"The truth will set you free,

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:29.795
but first it will piss you off." (Laughter)

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:32.063
So -- (Laughter)

00:00:32.063 --> 00:00:34.187
So with that in mind, I'm going to set about

00:00:34.187 --> 00:00:35.778
trying to do those things here,

00:00:35.778 --> 00:00:37.640
and talk about dying in the 21st century.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.040
Now the first thing that will piss you off, undoubtedly,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.659
is that all of us are, in fact, going to die

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:43.733
in the 21st century.

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.123
There will be no exceptions to that.

00:00:46.123 --> 00:00:48.780
There are, apparently, about one in eight of you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.304
who think you're immortal, on surveys, but --

00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:53.482
(Laughter)

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:58.095
Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen.

00:00:58.095 --> 00:00:59.748
While I give this talk, in the next 10 minutes,

00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:03.244
a hundred million of my cells will die,

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:05.838
and over the course of today, 2,000 of my brain cells

00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:07.979
will die and never come back,

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.060
so you could argue that the dying process

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.138
starts pretty early in the piece.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:14.252
Anyway, the second thing I want to say about dying in the

00:01:14.252 --> 00:01:16.617
21st century, apart from it's going to happen to everybody,

00:01:16.617 --> 00:01:19.233
is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:21.578
for most of us,

00:01:21.578 --> 00:01:24.547
unless we do something to try and reclaim this process

00:01:24.547 --> 00:01:28.264
from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on.

00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:30.072
So there you go. That's the truth.

00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:31.503
No doubt that will piss you off, and now let's see

00:01:31.503 --> 00:01:34.479
whether we can set you free. I don't promise anything.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.062
Now, as you heard in the intro, I work in intensive care,

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:40.166
and I think I've kind of lived through the heyday

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.173
of intensive care. It's been a ride, man.

00:01:42.173 --> 00:01:43.373
This has been fantastic.

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:44.528
We have machines that go ping.

00:01:44.528 --> 00:01:46.838
There's many of them up there.

00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:49.582
And we have some wizard technology which I think

00:01:49.582 --> 00:01:52.094
has worked really well, and over the course of the time

00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:54.166
I've worked in intensive care, the death rate

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.536
for males in Australia has halved,

00:01:56.536 --> 00:01:58.155
and intensive care has had something to do with that.

00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:00.163
Certainly, a lot of the technologies that we use

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:02.383
have got something to do with that.

00:02:02.383 --> 00:02:04.887
So we have had tremendous success, and we kind of

00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:07.241
got caught up in our own success quite a bit,

00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:10.865
and we started using expressions like "lifesaving."

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:12.999
I really apologize to everybody for doing that,

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.229
because obviously, we don't.

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:16.757
What we do is prolong people's lives,

00:02:16.757 --> 00:02:18.858
and delay death,

00:02:18.858 --> 00:02:21.703
and redirect death, but we can't, strictly speaking,

00:02:21.703 --> 00:02:24.558
save lives on any sort of permanent basis.

00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:26.543
And what's really happened over the period of time

00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:29.182
that I've been working in intensive care is that

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:32.752
the people whose lives we started saving back in the '70s,

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:37.230
'80s, and '90s, are now coming to die in the 21st century

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.830
of diseases that we no longer have the answers to

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.340
in quite the way we did then.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.215
So what's happening now is there's been a big shift

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:47.022
in the way that people die,

00:02:47.022 --> 00:02:49.293
and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable

00:02:49.293 --> 00:02:52.119
to what we can do as what it used to be like

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:56.030
when I was doing this in the '80s and '90s.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.894
So we kind of got a bit caught up with this,

00:02:58.894 --> 00:03:01.927
and we haven't really squared with you guys about

00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:05.982
what's really happening now, and it's about time we did.

00:03:05.982 --> 00:03:09.373
I kind of woke up to this bit in the late '90s

00:03:09.373 --> 00:03:11.467
when I met this guy.

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:15.824
This guy is called Jim, Jim Smith, and he looked like this.

00:03:15.824 --> 00:03:18.127
I was called down to the ward to see him.

00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:20.372
His is the little hand.

00:03:20.372 --> 00:03:21.758
I was called down to the ward to see him

00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:22.852
by a respiratory physician.

00:03:22.852 --> 00:03:25.028
He said, "Look, there's a guy down here.

00:03:25.028 --> 00:03:26.628
He's got pneumonia,

00:03:26.628 --> 00:03:29.133
and he looks like he needs intensive care.

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:31.207
His daughter's here and she wants everything possible

00:03:31.207 --> 00:03:33.738
to be done."

00:03:33.738 --> 00:03:36.357
Which is a familiar phrase to us.

00:03:36.357 --> 00:03:38.188
So I go down to the ward and see Jim,

00:03:38.188 --> 00:03:39.873
and his skin his translucent like this.

00:03:39.873 --> 00:03:42.123
You can see his bones through the skin.

00:03:42.123 --> 00:03:43.661
He's very, very thin,

00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:47.043
and he is, indeed, very sick with pneumonia,

00:03:47.043 --> 00:03:48.524
and he's too sick to talk to me,

00:03:48.524 --> 00:03:53.674
so I talk to his daughter Kathleen, and I say to her,

00:03:53.674 --> 00:03:56.638
"Did you and Jim ever talk about

00:03:56.638 --> 00:03:58.321
what you would want done

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.335
if he ended up in this kind of situation?"

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:04.064
And she looked at me and said, "No, of course not!"

00:04:04.064 --> 00:04:09.124
I thought, "Okay. Take this steady."

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.968
And I got talking to her, and after a while, she said to me,

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:14.971
"You know, we always thought there'd be time."

00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:18.737
Jim was 94. (Laughter)

00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:21.271
And I realized that something wasn't happening here.

00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:22.595
There wasn't this dialogue going on

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.248
that I imagined was happening.

00:04:25.248 --> 00:04:28.255
So a group of us started doing survey work,

00:04:28.255 --> 00:04:30.475
and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home

00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:33.815
residents in Newcastle, in the Newcastle area,

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.762
and discovered that only one in a hundred of them

00:04:36.762 --> 00:04:39.827
had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating.

00:04:39.827 --> 00:04:40.966
One in a hundred.

00:04:40.966 --> 00:04:44.307
And only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do

00:04:44.307 --> 00:04:47.404
if they became seriously ill.

00:04:47.404 --> 00:04:50.164
And I realized, of course, this dialogue

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:54.800
is definitely not occurring in the public at large.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.278
Now, I work in acute care.

00:04:56.278 --> 00:04:58.383
This is John Hunter Hospital.

00:04:58.383 --> 00:05:02.384
And I thought, surely, we do better than that.

00:05:02.384 --> 00:05:05.380
So a colleague of mine from nursing called Lisa Shaw and I

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.896
went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes

00:05:07.896 --> 00:05:09.169
in the medical records department

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.790
looking at whether there was any sign at all

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.218
that anybody had had any conversation about

00:05:14.218 --> 00:05:16.071
what might happen to them if the treatment they were

00:05:16.071 --> 00:05:19.415
receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die.

00:05:19.415 --> 00:05:22.356
And we didn't find a single record of any preference

00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:26.200
about goals, treatments or outcomes from any

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.770
of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.487
So we started to realize

00:05:33.487 --> 00:05:35.688
that we had a problem,

00:05:35.688 --> 00:05:40.711
and the problem is more serious because of this.

00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:44.013
What we know is that obviously we are all going to die,

00:05:44.013 --> 00:05:46.678
but how we die is actually really important,

00:05:46.678 --> 00:05:50.233
obviously not just to us, but also to how that

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:53.367
features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards.

00:05:53.367 --> 00:05:55.688
How we die lives on in the minds of everybody

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:58.805
who survives us, and

00:05:58.805 --> 00:06:02.537
the stress created in families by dying is enormous,

00:06:02.537 --> 00:06:05.223
and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying

00:06:05.223 --> 00:06:07.960
in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.038
so dying in intensive care is not your top option

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:13.496
if you've got a choice.

00:06:13.496 --> 00:06:15.665
And, if that wasn't bad enough, of course,

00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:18.313
all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that

00:06:18.313 --> 00:06:20.665
many of you, in fact, about one in 10 of you at this point,

00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:22.115
will die in intensive care.

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.449
In the U.S., it's one in five.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.199
In Miami, it's three out of five people die in intensive care.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.264
So this is the sort of momentum

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:31.552
that we've got at the moment.

00:06:31.552 --> 00:06:34.097
The reason why this is all happening is due to this,

00:06:34.097 --> 00:06:35.399
and I do have to take you through what this is about.

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:37.364
These are the four ways to go.

00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:40.229
So one of these will happen to all of us.

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.759
The ones you may know most about are the ones

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.605
that are becoming increasingly of historical interest:

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:47.022
sudden death.

00:06:47.022 --> 00:06:48.467
It's quite likely in an audience this size

00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:51.018
this won't happen to anybody here.

00:06:51.018 --> 00:06:52.748
Sudden death has become very rare.

00:06:52.748 --> 00:06:55.203
The death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff

00:06:55.203 --> 00:06:56.876
just doesn't happen anymore.

00:06:56.876 --> 00:06:59.293
The dying process of those with terminal illness

00:06:59.293 --> 00:07:00.325
that we've just seen

00:07:00.325 --> 00:07:01.940
occurs to younger people.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.790
By the time you've reached 80, this is unlikely to happen to you.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.205
Only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer.

00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:13.040
The big growth industry are these.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.291
What you die of is increasing organ failure,

00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:18.526
with your respiratory, cardiac, renal,

00:07:18.526 --> 00:07:20.306
whatever organs packing up. Each of these

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:22.909
would be an admission to an acute care hospital,

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:24.878
at the end of which, or at some point during which,

00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:27.054
somebody says, enough is enough, and we stop.

00:07:27.054 --> 00:07:29.622
And this one's the biggest growth industry of all,

00:07:29.622 --> 00:07:32.197
and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room

00:07:32.197 --> 00:07:34.759
will die in this form, which is

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:38.653
the dwindling of capacity

00:07:38.653 --> 00:07:40.972
with increasing frailty,

00:07:40.972 --> 00:07:43.222
and frailty's an inevitable part of aging,

00:07:43.222 --> 00:07:45.775
and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing

00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:46.824
that people die of now,

00:07:46.824 --> 00:07:48.952
and the last few years, or the last year of your life

00:07:48.952 --> 00:07:52.967
is spent with a great deal of disability, unfortunately.

00:07:52.967 --> 00:07:56.351
Enjoying it so far? (Laughs)

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:59.504
(Laughter)

00:07:59.504 --> 00:08:02.932
Sorry, I just feel such a, I feel such a Cassandra here.

00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:08.090
(Laughter)

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.149
What can I say that's positive? What's positive is

00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:11.564
that this is happening at very great age, now.

00:08:11.564 --> 00:08:14.309
We are all, most of us, living to reach this point.

00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:16.197
You know, historically, we didn't do that.

00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:17.666
This is what happens to you

00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:20.189
when you live to be a great age,

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:22.078
and unfortunately, increasing longevity does mean

00:08:22.078 --> 00:08:24.005
more old age, not more youth.

00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:30.098
I'm sorry to say that. (Laughter)

00:08:30.098 --> 00:08:31.895
What we did, anyway, look, what we did,

00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:33.422
we didn't just take this lying down

00:08:33.422 --> 00:08:34.924
at John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere.

00:08:34.924 --> 00:08:36.546
We've started a whole series of projects

00:08:36.546 --> 00:08:39.542
to try and look about whether we could, in fact, involve

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:43.036
people much more in the way that things happen to them.

00:08:43.036 --> 00:08:44.268
But we realized, of course, that we are dealing

00:08:44.268 --> 00:08:46.612
with cultural issues,

00:08:46.612 --> 00:08:48.471
and this is, I love this Klimt painting,

00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:50.676
because the more you look at it, the more you kind of get

00:08:50.676 --> 00:08:52.695
the whole issue that's going on here,

00:08:52.695 --> 00:08:56.213
which is clearly the separation of death from the living,

00:08:56.213 --> 00:08:58.093
and the fear — Like, if you actually look,

00:08:58.093 --> 00:08:59.268
there's one woman there

00:08:59.268 --> 00:09:01.187
who has her eyes open.

00:09:01.187 --> 00:09:02.872
She's the one he's looking at,

00:09:02.872 --> 00:09:06.100
and [she's] the one he's coming for. Can you see that?

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.626
She looks terrified.

00:09:07.626 --> 00:09:09.319
It's an amazing picture.

00:09:09.319 --> 00:09:11.540
Anyway, we had a major cultural issue.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.524
Clearly, people didn't want us to talk about death,

00:09:13.524 --> 00:09:15.019
or, we thought that.

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:16.966
So with loads of funding from the Federal Government

00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:18.386
and the local Health Service, we introduced a thing

00:09:18.386 --> 00:09:21.284
at John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices.

00:09:21.284 --> 00:09:24.133
We trained hundreds of people to go to the wards

00:09:24.133 --> 00:09:27.276
and talk to people about the fact that they would die,

00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:29.562
and what would they prefer under those circumstances.

00:09:29.562 --> 00:09:33.081
They loved it. The families and the patients, they loved it.

00:09:33.081 --> 00:09:35.541
Ninety-eight percent of people really thought

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:36.995
this just should have been normal practice,

00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:39.378
and that this is how things should work.

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:41.316
And when they expressed wishes,

00:09:41.316 --> 00:09:43.289
all of those wishes came true, as it were.

00:09:43.289 --> 00:09:45.269
We were able to make that happen for them.

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:47.519
But then, when the funding ran out,

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:49.604
we went back to look six months later,

00:09:49.604 --> 00:09:51.871
and everybody had stopped again,

00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:55.064
and nobody was having these conversations anymore.

00:09:55.064 --> 00:09:57.117
So that was really kind of heartbreaking for us,

00:09:57.117 --> 00:09:59.834
because we thought this was going to really take off.

00:09:59.834 --> 00:10:03.805
The cultural issue had reasserted itself.

00:10:03.805 --> 00:10:04.960
So here's the pitch:

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.046
I think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway

00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:11.545
to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not

00:10:11.545 --> 00:10:13.338
that's where we all want to end up,

00:10:13.338 --> 00:10:15.474
particularly as we become older and increasingly frail

00:10:15.474 --> 00:10:19.128
and ICU has less and less and less to offer us.

00:10:19.128 --> 00:10:21.458
There has to be a little side road

00:10:21.458 --> 00:10:25.933
off there for people who don't want to go on that track.

00:10:25.933 --> 00:10:28.569
And I have one small idea,

00:10:28.569 --> 00:10:33.018
and one big idea about what could happen.

00:10:33.018 --> 00:10:34.079
And this is the small idea.

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:36.860
The small idea is, let's all of us

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.796
engage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated.

00:10:40.796 --> 00:10:42.849
Why can't we have these kinds of conversations

00:10:42.849 --> 00:10:44.170
with our own elders

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.960
and people who might be approaching this?

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.794
There are a couple of things you can do.

00:10:48.794 --> 00:10:50.925
One of them is, you can,

00:10:50.925 --> 00:10:53.839
just ask this simple question. This question never fails.

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:57.594
"In the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself,

00:10:57.594 --> 00:11:00.527
who would you like to speak for you?"

00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:02.441
That's a really important question to ask people,

00:11:02.441 --> 00:11:04.464
because giving people the control over who that is

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:07.772
produces an amazing outcome.

00:11:07.772 --> 00:11:08.918
The second thing you can say is,

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.416
"Have you spoken to that person

00:11:10.416 --> 00:11:12.336
about the things that are important to you

00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:16.490
so that we've got a better idea of what it is we can do?"

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.012
So that's the little idea.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.506
The big idea, I think, is more political.

00:11:20.506 --> 00:11:22.457
I think we have to get onto this.

00:11:22.457 --> 00:11:25.519
I suggested we should have Occupy Death.

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:28.304
(Laughter)

00:11:28.304 --> 00:11:30.874
My wife said, "Yeah, right, sit-ins in the mortuary.

00:11:30.874 --> 00:11:33.453
Yeah, yeah. Sure." (Laughter)

00:11:33.453 --> 00:11:35.318
So that one didn't really run,

00:11:35.318 --> 00:11:36.988
but I was very struck by this.

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:38.701
Now, I'm an aging hippie.

00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:41.198
I don't know, I don't think I look like that anymore, but

00:11:41.198 --> 00:11:43.698
I had, two of my kids were born at home in the '80s

00:11:43.698 --> 00:11:47.166
when home birth was a big thing, and we baby boomers

00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:49.862
are used to taking charge of the situation,

00:11:49.862 --> 00:11:53.260
so if you just replace all these words of birth,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.341
I like "Peace, Love, Natural Death" as an option.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.857
I do think we have to get political

00:11:57.857 --> 00:12:00.455
and start to reclaim this process from

00:12:00.455 --> 00:12:02.422
the medicalized model in which it's going.

00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:04.462
Now, listen, that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia.

00:12:04.462 --> 00:12:06.654
I want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all,

00:12:06.654 --> 00:12:09.318
I hate euthanasia. I think it's a sideshow.

00:12:09.318 --> 00:12:11.505
I don't think euthanasia matters.

00:12:11.505 --> 00:12:13.656
I actually think that,

00:12:13.656 --> 00:12:16.205
in places like Oregon,

00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:19.677
where you can have physician-assisted suicide,

00:12:19.677 --> 00:12:21.894
you take a poisonous dose of stuff,

00:12:21.894 --> 00:12:23.770
only half a percent of people ever do that.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.476
I'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent

00:12:26.476 --> 00:12:28.232
of people who don't want to do that.

00:12:28.232 --> 00:12:30.566
I think most people don't want to be dead,

00:12:30.566 --> 00:12:32.663
but I do think most people want to have some control

00:12:32.663 --> 00:12:35.405
over how their dying process proceeds.

00:12:35.405 --> 00:12:36.545
So I'm an opponent of euthanasia,

00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:39.198
but I do think we have to give people back some control.

00:12:39.198 --> 00:12:42.671
It deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply.

00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:44.023
I think we should be looking at stopping

00:12:44.023 --> 00:12:45.062
the want for euthanasia,

00:12:45.062 --> 00:12:49.757
not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all.

00:12:49.757 --> 00:12:53.333
This is a quote from Dame Cicely Saunders,

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:54.702
whom I met when I was a medical student.

00:12:54.702 --> 00:12:57.581
She founded the hospice movement.

00:12:57.581 --> 00:12:59.772
And she said, "You matter because you are,

00:12:59.772 --> 00:13:02.294
and you matter to the last moment of your life."

00:13:02.294 --> 00:13:04.551
And I firmly believe that

00:13:04.551 --> 00:13:07.637
that's the message that we have to carry forward.

00:13:07.637 --> 00:13:10.656
Thank you. (Applause)
