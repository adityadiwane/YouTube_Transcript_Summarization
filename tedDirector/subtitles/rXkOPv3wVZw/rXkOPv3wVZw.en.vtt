00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:19.271
The Kraken, a beast so terrifying

00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:22.368
it was said to devour men and ships and whales,

00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:26.295
and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:28.551
In assessing the merits of such tales,

00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:31.436
it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:35.059
that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.696
is a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time,"

00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:42.929
and a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit." (Laughter)

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:44.707
Every fish that gets away

00:00:44.707 --> 00:00:46.855
grows with every telling of the tale.

00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:49.342
Nevertheless, there are giants in the ocean,

00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:51.371
and we now have video proof,

00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:55.993
as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware.

00:00:55.993 --> 00:00:58.630
I was one of the three scientists on this expedition

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.826
that took place last summer off Japan.

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:03.322
I'm the short one.

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:07.380
The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.910
I owe my participation in this now-historic event

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.716
to TED.

00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:15.791
In 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue

00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:18.525
held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:22.367
as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish.

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:25.156
I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean,

00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:29.933
one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.229
Mike deGruy was also invited,

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.784
and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean,

00:01:35.784 --> 00:01:38.197
and he also talked to me about applying my approach

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.853
to something he's been involved with for a very long time,

00:01:40.853 --> 00:01:44.287
which is the hunt for the giant squid.

00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:48.167
It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit,

00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:52.292
a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:57.081
that summer during Shark Week. (Laughter)

00:01:57.081 --> 00:01:59.497
I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing

00:01:59.497 --> 00:02:02.040
and optical luring of deep sea squid

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.817
in which I emphasized the importance

00:02:03.817 --> 00:02:09.067
of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.

00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:11.792
This came out of hundreds of dives I have made,

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:14.118
farting around in the dark

00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:16.896
using these platforms,

00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:20.479
and my impression that I saw more animals

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:22.360
working from the submersible

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.280
than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.650
But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.339
But I also felt like I saw more animals

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.190
working with the Tiburon than the Ventana,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.375
two vehicles with the same field of view

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:36.413
but different propulsion systems.

00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:40.444
So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.

00:02:40.444 --> 00:02:42.700
So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.860
and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.292
and recorded the sound they made.

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:49.929
The Johnson Sea-Link -- (whirring noise) --

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.524
which you can probably just barely hear here,

00:02:52.524 --> 00:02:56.124
uses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet.

00:02:56.124 --> 00:02:59.479
The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:04.558
It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier. (Louder whirring noise)

00:03:04.558 --> 00:03:07.761
But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics

00:03:07.761 --> 00:03:11.199
and they sound like the Ventana. (Loud beeping noise)

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.625
I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:17.118
So for the deep sea squid hunt,

00:03:17.118 --> 00:03:19.275
I proposed using an optical lure

00:03:19.275 --> 00:03:21.435
attached to a camera platform

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:26.203
with no thrusters, no motors,

00:03:26.203 --> 00:03:28.812
just a battery-powered camera,

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:31.832
and the only illumination coming from red light

00:03:31.832 --> 00:03:34.324
that's invisible to most deep-sea animals

00:03:34.324 --> 00:03:37.016
that are adapted to see primarily blue.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.278
That's visible to our eye,

00:03:38.278 --> 00:03:41.619
but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:44.460
So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.589
could just be thrown off the back of the ship,

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:52.175
attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line,

00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:56.254
it would just float around passively carried by the currents,

00:03:56.254 --> 00:04:00.651
and the only light visible to the animals in the deep

00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:04.638
would be the blue light of the optical lure,

00:04:04.638 --> 00:04:08.418
which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly,

00:04:08.418 --> 00:04:11.278
because it was designed to imitate

00:04:11.278 --> 00:04:13.534
the bioluminescent display

00:04:13.534 --> 00:04:16.879
of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:20.440
Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.423
is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm

00:04:23.423 --> 00:04:25.701
and is a form of defense.

00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:28.882
The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure

00:04:28.882 --> 00:04:31.785
is not because giant squid eat jellyfish,

00:04:31.785 --> 00:04:36.214
but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light

00:04:36.214 --> 00:04:38.591
when it's being chewed on by a predator

00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:41.270
and its only hope for escape

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.245
may be to attract the attention of a larger predator

00:04:44.245 --> 00:04:46.307
that will attack its attacker

00:04:46.307 --> 00:04:48.850
and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.742
It's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape,

00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:56.150
and a common form of defense in the deep sea.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.263
The approach worked.

00:04:58.263 --> 00:05:01.774
Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner

00:05:01.774 --> 00:05:04.222
a single video glimpse of the giant,

00:05:04.222 --> 00:05:08.887
we managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.

00:05:08.887 --> 00:05:22.105
Edith Widder (on video): Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there.

00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:25.241
EW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance --

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.286
now you see me, now you don't --

00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:30.289
and we had four such teasing appearances,

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.698
and then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us.

00:05:35.698 --> 00:05:39.971
(Music) Narrator: (Speaking in Japanese)

00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:49.813
Scientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa!

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.513
(Applause)

00:05:54.513 --> 00:05:59.367
EW: The full monty.

00:05:59.367 --> 00:06:00.712
What really wowed me about that

00:06:00.712 --> 00:06:02.886
was the way it came in up over the e-jelly

00:06:02.886 --> 00:06:05.206
and then attacked the enormous thing next to it,

00:06:05.206 --> 00:06:08.512
which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.

00:06:08.512 --> 00:06:10.931
But even more incredible was the footage shot

00:06:10.931 --> 00:06:13.576
from the Triton submersible.

00:06:13.576 --> 00:06:16.360
What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.806
was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used,

00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:23.408
a one-meter long diamondback squid

00:06:23.408 --> 00:06:26.120
had a light attached to it, a squid jig

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.704
of the type that longline fishermen use,

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:30.742
and I think it was this light

00:06:30.742 --> 00:06:33.291
that brought the giant in.

00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:34.756
Now, what you're seeing

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:39.854
is the intensified camera's view under red light,

00:06:39.854 --> 00:06:43.976
and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.

00:06:43.976 --> 00:06:46.431
And then he got so excited,

00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:49.926
he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better,

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:52.110
and the giant didn't run away,

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.351
so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible,

00:06:55.351 --> 00:06:57.887
bringing a creature of legend

00:06:57.887 --> 00:07:02.858
from the misty history into high-resolution video.

00:07:02.858 --> 00:07:06.126
It was absolutely breathtaking,

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:09.055
and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact

00:07:09.055 --> 00:07:10.520
and fully extended,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.772
it would have been as tall as a two-story house.

00:07:13.772 --> 00:07:16.431
How could something that big

00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:21.031
live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?

00:07:21.031 --> 00:07:24.655
We've only explored about five percent of our ocean.

00:07:24.655 --> 00:07:27.791
There are great discoveries yet to be made down there,

00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:32.413
fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution

00:07:32.413 --> 00:07:34.510
and possibly bioactive compounds

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.325
that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.

00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:41.373
Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction

00:07:41.373 --> 00:07:44.742
of the money on ocean exploration

00:07:44.742 --> 00:07:47.149
that we've spent on space exploration.

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:50.794
We need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration,

00:07:50.794 --> 00:07:53.629
because we need to be exploring and protecting

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:56.221
our life support systems here on Earth.

00:07:56.221 --> 00:08:02.453
We need — thank you. (Applause)

00:08:02.453 --> 00:08:05.307
Exploration is the engine that drives innovation.

00:08:05.307 --> 00:08:08.278
Innovation drives economic growth.

00:08:08.278 --> 00:08:09.801
So let's all go exploring,

00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:12.902
but let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away,

00:08:12.902 --> 00:08:15.235
or, as Mike deGruy once said,

00:08:15.235 --> 00:08:17.021
"If you want to get away from it all

00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:18.635
and see something you've never seen,

00:08:18.635 --> 00:08:22.220
or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.750
get in a sub."

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.956
He should have been with us for this adventure.

00:08:25.956 --> 00:08:27.763
We miss him.

00:08:27.763 --> 00:08:32.979
(Applause)
