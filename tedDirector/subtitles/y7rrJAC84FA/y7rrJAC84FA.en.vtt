00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.160
Can I say how delighted I am to be away

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
from the calm of Westminster and Whitehall? (Laughter)

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
This is Kim, a nine-year-old Vietnam girl,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.160
her back ruined by napalm,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.160
and she awakened the conscience of the nation of America

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
to begin to end the Vietnam War.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.160
This is Birhan, who was the Ethiopian girl

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.160
who launched Live Aid in the 1980s,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
15 minutes away from death when she was rescued,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
This is Tiananmen Square.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.160
A man before a tank became a picture

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.160
that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.160
This next is the Sudanese girl,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
a few moments from death,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
a vulture hovering in the background,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
a picture that went round the world

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
and shocked people into action on poverty.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
This is Neda, the Iranian girl

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.160
who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.160
only a few weeks ago, and she is now the focus, rightly so,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
of the YouTube generation.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.160
And what do all these pictures and events have in common?

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
What they have in common is what we see unlocks

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
what we cannot see.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.160
What we see unlocks the invisible ties

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
and bonds of sympathy that bring us together

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
to become a human community.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
What these pictures demonstrate is that

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
we do feel the pain of others,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
however distantly.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
What I think these pictures demonstrate

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
What these pictures demonstrate is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.160
that there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.160
across all continents -- a moral sense that

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
not only do we share the pain of others,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
and believe in something bigger than ourselves

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
but we have a duty to act when we see things

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
that are wrong that need righted,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
see injuries that need to be corrected,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
see problems that need to be rectified.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.160
There is a story about Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
Before he arrived Ronald Reagan said --

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister --

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
"Isn’t this man a communist?"

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.160
The reply was, "No, Mr President, he’s an anti-communist."

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
And Ronald Reagan said, "I don’t care what kind of communist he is!"

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
(Laughter)

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
Ronald Reagan asked Olof Palme,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160
the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.160
"Well, what do you believe in? Do you want to abolish the rich?"

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
He said, "No, I want to abolish the poor."

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.160
to realize their potential to the full.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.160
I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
that commands attention from people of every religion

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
and every faith, and people of no faith.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.160
But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
to communicate instantaneously across frontiers

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
right across the world.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
We now have the capacity to find common ground

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
with people who we will never meet,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.160
but who we will meet through the Internet and through

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
all the modern means of communication;

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
that we now have the capacity to organize

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
and take collective action together

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
to deal with the problem or an injustice

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
that we want to deal with;

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
and it is the start of what I would call

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
the creation of a truly global society.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
Go back 200 years when the slave trade was

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.160
under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
They protested across Britain.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
They won public opinion over a long period of time.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.160
But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.160
if they were able to use the modern means of communication

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
to win people’s hearts and minds?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
the woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.160
She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.160
as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.160
who were part of the defeated families of Austria,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
that in Britain she wanted to take action,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
but she had to go house to house,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
leaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
in the Royal Albert Hall

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
that eventually gave birth to Save the Children,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
an international organization that is now fully recognized

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.160
as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
But what more could she have done

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
if she’d had the modern means of communications available to her

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
to create a sense that the injustice that people saw

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160
had to be acted upon immediately?

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.160
Now look at what’s happened in the last 10 years.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
In Philippines in 2001, President Estrada --

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.160
a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.160
eventually brought it down and it was, of course, called the "coup de text." (Laughter)

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.160
Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.160
Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
of what was happening at the polling stations, it was impossible

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.160
for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160
Or take Burma and the monks that were blogging out,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.160
a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening, until these blogs

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
told the world that there was a repression,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
meaning that lives were being lost

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
and people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.160
who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
had to be listened to.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Then take Iran itself, and what people are doing today:

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
following what happened to Neda,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.160
people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
who are blogging out of Iran, any by everybody who is blogging,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160
changing their address to Tehran, Iran,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
and making it difficult for the security services.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.160
Take, therefore, what modern technology is capable of:

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:54.160
the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
and our ability to organize internationally.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.160
That, in my view, gives us the first opportunity as a community

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.160
to fundamentally change the world.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites;

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.160
it’s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
who are communicating with each other around the world.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.160
150 years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
was how young people, children, had the right to education.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.160
100 years ago in most countries in Europe, the pressure was for the right to vote.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.160
50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:43.160
In the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.160
discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality;

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
all these have come under pressure

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.160
because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.160
I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago, when he was in London.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.160
I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.160
and for the creation of new resources for his foundation.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.160
I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela -- I was very privileged to do so --

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage. (Laughter)

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.160
And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.160
and I was explaining to him at the time who she was.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.160
Amy Winehouse said, "Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.160
My husband too has spent a long time in prison."

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
(Laughter)

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.160
Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
and he summarized the challenge for us all.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.160
He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain, the mountain

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.160
of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
He said that there was a greater challenge ahead,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.160
the challenge of poverty, of climate change -- global challenges

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
that needed global solutions

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.160
and needed the creation of a truly global society.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.160
We are the first generation which is in a position to do this.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
Combine the power of a global ethic

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.160
with the power of our ability to communicate

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.160
and organize globally, with the challenges that we now face,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
most of which are global in their nature.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
Climate change cannot be solved in one country,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
but has got to be solved by the world working together.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
A financial crisis, just as we have seen, could not be solved

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
by America alone or Europe alone;

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
it needed the world to work together.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160
Take the problems of security and terrorism and, equally,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
the problem of human rights and development:

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
they cannot be solved by Africa alone;

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.160
they cannot be solved by America or Europe alone.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.160
So the great project of our generation, it seems to me,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.160
is to build for the first time, out of a global ethic

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
and our global ability to communicate

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
and organize together, a truly global society,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
built on that ethic but with institutions

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.160
that can serve that global society and make for a different future.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.160
We have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
that we have a situation

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.160
where we know that there is a climate change problem,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.160
where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
to the poorest countries to deal with that,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
when we want to create a global carbon market,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
but there is no global institution

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
that people have been able to agree upon

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
to deal with this problem?

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
One of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
is an agreement that there will be

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
a global environmental institution

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
that is able to deal

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
with the problems of persuading the whole of the world

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
to move along a climate-change agenda.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.160
(Applause)

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.160
One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
is that we have got to persuade people around the world

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
to change their behavior as well,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
across the generations.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
Take the financial crisis.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:20.160
If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.160
or starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
If people can find that that sub-prime product

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
has been transferred across nations

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
many, many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
or the rest in Britain,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
and people's ordinary savings are affected by it,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160
then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
You need in the long run for stability, for economic growth,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
for jobs, as well as for financial stability,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
global economic institutions that make sure

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
that growth to be sustained has to be shared,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
and are built on the principle

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
that the prosperity of this world is indivisible.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.160
that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160
not the ideas that were the basis

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.160
of the last stage of financial development over these recent years.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.160
Then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.160
and the rest of the world, the poorest part of the world.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.160
We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
and yet, out of people’s desire for a global ethic

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
and a global society that can be done.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.160
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
This is a country of six and a half million people,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.160
but it has only 80 doctors; it has 200 nurses;

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
it has 120 midwives.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.160
You cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
with such limited resources.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
Or take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
a girl called Miriam.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.160
She was 11 years old; her parents had both died from AIDS,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
her mother and then her father.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
She was an AIDS orphan being handed

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
across different extended families to be cared for.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
She herself was suffering from HIV;

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
she was suffering from tuberculosis.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.160
I met her in a field, she was ragged, she had no shoes.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
When you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
is looking forward to the future,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.160
but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl’s eyes

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.160
and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.160
I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.160
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
the poorest countries

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.160
based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.160
so that Africa is not a net importer of food, but an exporter of food.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.160
Take the problems of human rights and

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
the problems of security in so many countries around the world.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.160
Burma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
for wars that we could prevent.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
In the Rwanda Children's Museum,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.160
there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:18.160
and the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.160
in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.160
There is a photograph of a boy called David.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.160
Beside that photograph there is the information about his life.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
It said "David, age 10."

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
David: ambition to be a doctor.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.160
Favorite sport: football. What did he enjoy most?

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.160
Making people laugh.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.160
How did he die?

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160
Tortured to death.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.160
Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death:

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.160
"Don't worry. The United Nations are coming."

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
And we never did.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
And that young boy believed our promises

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
and we never did.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
So we have got to create in this world also

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.160
but also for reconstruction and security

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160
for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.160
So my argument today is basically this.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.160
We have the means by which we could create a truly global society.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:29.160
The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.160
That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.160
for these institutions to work,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
but we should not lose the chance in this generation,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.160
in this decade in particular, with President Obama in America,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
with other people working with us around the world,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
to create global institutions for the environment,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
and for finance,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
and for security and for development,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160
that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.160
our desire to bind the world together, and

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.160
our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.160
It is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences,

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:13.160
people used to turn to each other and say about Cicero, "Great speech."

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160
But it is said that in Ancient Greece

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.160
when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.160
people turned to each other and didn’t say "Great speech."

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160
They said, "Let's march."

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.160
We should be marching towards a global society.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.160
Thank you.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:33.160
(Applause)
