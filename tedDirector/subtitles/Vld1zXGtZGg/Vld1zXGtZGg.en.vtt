00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'd like to start tonight by something completely different,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
asking you to join me by stepping off the land

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And it's a lively and a lovely place,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our --

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
not only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
but also, most recently, with climate change,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now, as we continue to tinker with the oceans,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
will be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
is just not going to fill you up.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So it may be good for the waistline,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that is, unless you eat jellyfish.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
whose primary prey are jellyfish.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
This animal is in "The Guinness World Book of Records"

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
for being the world's heaviest bony fish.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
that the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
that its favorite food is the moon jelly.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
even if one is eating the other.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now this is typically how you see sunfish,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
this is where they get their common name.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
They like to sunbathe, can't blame them.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
They just lay out on the surface of the sea

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
they lie out and bask on the surface.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Their other name, Mola mola, is -- it sounds Hawaiian,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
but it's actually Latin for millstone,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
was this terribly bizarre shape.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
You know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and then you look at the sunfish.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
(Laughter)

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
except in the light of evolution.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
The Mola's no exception.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Of course evolution is somewhat random, and you know,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
we're going to head to the high seas.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and we turn our puffer into the Mola.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
You know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
They look -- maybe they look

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
kind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
but in fact, in fact they are the --

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
right up there with flat fish.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
They're -- every single thing about that fish has been changed.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And in terms of fishes --

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
just 50 million years ago, so --

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
They start as little eggs,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and they're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine --

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And from that little egg,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000
They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
That's a little diver up there in the corner.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
They're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
till they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
600 million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and you had to feed this thing.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
That would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but --

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
one of the first places to have them in captivity --

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I said, now, that's a true American.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
(Laughter)

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
(Applause)

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
because schooling used to be salvation for fishes,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
but it's suicide for fishes now.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
they still get caught in nets as by-catch.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
how they live their lives, like the Mola.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
up to 26 percent of the drift net.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
they make up up to 90 percent.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And how do you do that?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
This is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries -- it doesn't go to land.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
How do you get insight?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Well, there's some great new technology

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
that has just recently become available,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
That little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
which is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And it can record this data for up to two years,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have --

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So the great thing about the Mola

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I think Donne wrote a poem about that.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But they have 40 genera of parasites,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
They don't seem to mind, so far.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
We're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
using temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
We'd love to tag in Monterey.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Not this time of year -- it's more around October.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey --

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
rips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and then tosses them back and forth.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And I'm not exaggerating, it is just --

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
The poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
so we head down south, to San Diego.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Not so many California sea lions down there.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
because it's spa time for the Molas there.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And they come and give the Molas --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
you can see they strike this funny little position that says,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
"I'm not threatening, but I need a massage."

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
(Laughter)

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean --

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And it's also a great place to go down south

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
will say, "Okay, scratch me right there."

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
You truly can swim up to a Mola -- they're very gentle --

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific;

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
we've gone over to another part of the Pacific,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Well, not the one we tagged!

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
to the fin muscle to -- I think that ís pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So the hardest part of tagging, now, is

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
during the course that the tag is recording.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
so you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And so the waiting is really the hardest part.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I'm going to show you our latest dataset.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And we found that they kind of are homebodies.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
They're not big migrators. This is their track:

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And that's kind of their home range.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
that population doesn't get replenished.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So that's a very important piece of data.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
But also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
They're super industrious.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we --

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and up and down, up to 40 times a day.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Down -- and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000
They plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
and this is why you see them on the surface -- it's so cold down there.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
They've got to come up, warm, get that solar power,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer --

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
which a whole variety of food's in that layer.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
between the surface and the bottom and through temperature.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
We see the same pattern -- now with these tags

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
a real three-dimensional play.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
where they're going to be tagging all over the world

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and the Mola's going to enter into that.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
It's never -- it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Which brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
But people would write into the site with all sorts of,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
all sorts of stories about these animals

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared --

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
a shared love and an interest in the oceans.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I was getting reports from Catholic nuns,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Jewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians -- everybody writing in,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
united by their love of life.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And to me that -- I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself:

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin."

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.
