00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This song is one of Thomas' favorites,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
called "What You Do with What You've Got."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
♫ You must know someone like him ♫

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
♫ He was tall and strong and lean ♫

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
♫ With a body like a greyhound ♫

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
♫ and a mind so sharp and keen ♫

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
♫ But his heart, just like laurel ♫

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
♫ grew twisted around itself ♫

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
♫ Till almost everything he did ♫

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
♫ brought pain to someone else ♫

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
♫ It's not just what you're born with ♫

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
♫ It's what you choose to bear ♫

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
♫ It's not how big your share is ♫

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
♫ It's how much you can share ♫

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
♫ It's not the fights you dreamed of ♫

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
♫ It's those you really fought ♫

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
♫ It's not what you've been given ♫

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
♫ It's what you do with what you've got ♫

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
♫ What's the use of two strong legs ♫

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
♫ if you only run away? ♫

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
♫ And what's the use of the finest voice ♫

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
♫ if you've nothing good to say? ♫

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
♫ What's the use of strength and muscle ♫

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
♫ if you only push and shove? ♫

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
♫ And what's the use of two good ears ♫

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
♫ if you can't hear those you love? ♫

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
♫ What's the use of two strong legs ♫

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
♫ if you only run away? ♫

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
♫ And what's the use of the finest voice ♫

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
♫ if you've nothing good to say? ♫

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
♫ What's the use of strength and muscle ♫

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
♫ if you only push and shove? ♫

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
♫ And what's the use of two good ears ♫

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
♫ if you can't hear those you love? ♫

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
♫ Between those who use their neighbors ♫

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
♫ and those who use the cane ♫

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
♫ Between those in constant power ♫

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
♫ and those in constant pain ♫

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
♫ Between those who run to glory ♫

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
♫ and those who cannot run ♫

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
♫ Tell me which ones are the cripples ♫

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
♫ and which ones touch the sun ♫

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:17.000
(Applause) Thank you very much.
