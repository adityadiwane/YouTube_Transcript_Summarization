00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
When I was growing up in Montana,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I had two dreams.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
I wanted to be a paleontologist,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
a dinosaur paleontologist,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
And so that's what I've been striving for

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
all of my life.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I was very fortunate

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
early in my career.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
I was fortunate

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
in finding things.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
I wasn't very good at reading things.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
In fact, I don't read much of anything.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
I am extremely dyslexic,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and so reading is the hardest thing I do.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
But instead, I go out and I find things.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Then I just pick things up.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I basically practice for finding money on the street.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
(Laughter)

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And I wander about the hills,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
and I have found a few things.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And I have been fortunate enough

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.260
to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and the first baby dinosaurs in nests,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
the first dinosaur embryos

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and massive accumulations of bones.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
And it happened to be at a time

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.260
when people were just starting to begin to realize

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
that people had thought for so many years.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
People were starting to get an idea

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
that dinosaurs were special.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And so, at that time,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
I was able to make some interesting hypotheses

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
along with my colleagues.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
We were able to actually say

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had --

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
that dinosaurs built nests

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and lived in colonies

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and cared for their young,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
brought food to their babies

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and traveled in gigantic herds.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
So it was pretty interesting stuff.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
I have gone on to find more things

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
We have found a lot of evidence

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
that dinosaurs changed

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
The appearance of them would have been different --

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
which it is in all social animals.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
In social groups of animals,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
the juveniles always look different than the adults.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
The adults can recognize the juveniles;

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
the juveniles can recognize the adults.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
And so we're making a better picture

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
of what a dinosaur looks like.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
(Laughter)

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
But it is that social thing

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.260
that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And in his book, he talked about the social animals.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And then Steven Spielberg, of course,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
depicts these dinosaurs

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
as being very social creatures.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
The theme of this story is building a dinosaur,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park."

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.260
to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
You all know the story, right.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
If you want to make a dinosaur,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.260
you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap --

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
otherwise known as amber --

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
that has some blood-sucking insects in it,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
good ones,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
and you get your insect and you drill into it

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and you suck out some DNA,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
sucked dinosaur DNA out.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and you clone it.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
or something like that,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
and then you wait,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
And everybody's happy about that.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
(Laughter)

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And they're happy over and over again.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
They keep doing it; they just keep making these things.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And then, then, then, and then ...

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Then the dinosaurs, being social,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
act out their socialness,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
and they get together,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and they conspire.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie --

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
So I assume everybody knows

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and you drilled into it,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and you got something out of that insect,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
you'd have a room full of mosquitos.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
(Laughter)

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.260
(Applause)

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Now if you want dinosaur DNA,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
I say go to the dinosaur.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
So that's what we've done.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Back in 1993 when the movie came out,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and we chose the dinosaur on the left,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And one of my former doctoral students,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Dr. Mary Schweitzer,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
actually had the background

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
to do this sort of thing.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
one of the thigh bones,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
and she actually found

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
some very interesting structures in there.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.260
They found these red circular-looking objects,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and they looked, for all the world,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
like red blood cells.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
And they're in

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
what appear to be the blood channels

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
that go through the bone.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And so she thought, well, what the heck.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
So she sampled some material out of it.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
But she did find heme,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
which is the biological foundation

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
of hemoglobin.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And that was really cool.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
That was interesting.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.260
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Well we tried and tried

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
and we couldn't really get anything else out of it.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
So a few years went by,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
and then we started the Hell Creek Project.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and hopefully find some dinosaurs

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
that had more material in them.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
And out in eastern Montana

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and not very many people,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And we did find a lot of stuff.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
but we found one special Tyrannosaur,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
and we called it B-rex.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
And B-rex was found

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
under a thousand cubic yards of rock.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
It wasn't a very complete T. rex,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
and it wasn't a very big T. rex,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
but it was a very special B-rex.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
And I and my colleagues cut into it,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
and we were able to determine,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
that B-rex had died at the age of 16.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
because we haven't found the oldest one yet.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
But this one died at the age of 16.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and she was actually able to determine

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that B-rex was a female

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
based on medullary tissue

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
found on the inside of the bone.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
the calcium storage basically,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
when an animal is pregnant,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
when a bird is pregnant.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
So here was the character

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
that linked birds and dinosaurs.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
But Mary went further.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Now we all know that bones are fossilized,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and so if you dump it into acid,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
there shouldn't be anything left.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
But there was something left.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
There were blood vessels left.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.260
There were flexible, clear blood vessels.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
It was extraordinary.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
But she also found osteocytes,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
which are the cells that laid down the bones.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.260
And try and try, we could not find DNA,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
but she did find evidence of proteins.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
But we thought maybe --

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
well, we thought maybe

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
And so we built a laboratory

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
and actually took the laboratory to the field

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
where we could get better samples.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
And we did. We got better material.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
The cells looked better.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
The vessels looked better.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Found the protein collagen.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
I mean, it was wonderful stuff.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.260
But it's not dinosaur DNA.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
So we have discovered

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
just breaks down too fast.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
We're just not going to be able

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
to do what they did in "Jurassic Park."

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
based on a dinosaur.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.260
But birds are dinosaurs.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
Birds are living dinosaurs.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
We actually classify them

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
as dinosaurs.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
and avian dinosaurs.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
So the non-avian dinosaurs

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
are the big clunky ones that went extinct.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
So we don't have to make a dinosaur

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
because we already have them.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.260
(Laughter)

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.260
I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
(Laughter)

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No."

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
(Laughter)

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
"You can call it a dinosaur,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
(Laughter)

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
"The chicken is not."

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
(Laughter)

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
So this is our problem,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
as you can imagine.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
The chicken is a dinosaur.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
I mean it really is.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
You can't argue with it

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
(Laughter)

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.260
(Applause)

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
But the sixth-graders demand it.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
"Fix the chicken."

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
(Laughter)

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
So that's what I'm here to tell you about:

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
how we are going to fix a chicken.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
So we have a number of ways

00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:00.260
that we actually can fix the chicken.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Because evolution works,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
we actually have some evolutionary tools.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
We'll call them biological modification tools.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
We have selection.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
And we know selection works.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
We started out with a wolf-like creature

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
and we ended up with a Maltese.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
I mean, that's --

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.260
that's definitely genetic modification.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
We also have transgenesis.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
Transgenesis is really cool too.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
That's how people make GloFish.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
You take a glow gene

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.260
out of a coral or a jellyfish

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
and you stick it in a zebrafish,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
and, puff, they glow.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
And that's pretty cool.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
And now they're making Glow-rabbits

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
I guess we could make a glow chicken.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
(Laughter)

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
But there's another thing.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
There's what we call atavism activation.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
And atavism activation

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
is basically --

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.260
an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
You heard

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
that occasionally children are born with tails,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.260
and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And so there are a number of atavisms

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
that can happen.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
And here's an example.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
This is a chicken with teeth.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
at the University of Wisconsin in Madison

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
actually figured out a way to stimulate

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
the gene for teeth,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
and produce teeth in chickens.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
Now that's a good characteristic.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
We can save that one.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
We know we can use that.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
We can make a chicken with teeth.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
That's getting closer.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
That's better than a glowing chicken.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
(Laughter)

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
A friend of mine, a colleague of mine,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
is actually looking at atavisms.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
And he's looking at them

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
by looking at the embryo genesis of birds

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
and actually looking at how they develop,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.260
and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
He's also interested in the transformation

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
of the arm, the hand, to the wing.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
He's looking for those genes as well.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
And I said, "Well, if you can find those,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
I can just reverse them

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
And so he agreed.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
And so that's what we're looking into.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
If you look at dinosaur hands,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
a velociraptor

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
still has that very primitive hand.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
But as you can see, the pigeon,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
or a chicken or anything else, another bird,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
has kind of a weird-looking hand,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
because the hand is a wing.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
But the cool thing is

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
that, if you look in the embryo,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
as the embryo is developing

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
the hand actually looks

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
It has the three fingers, the three digits.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
And so what we're looking for is that gene.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
We want to stop that gene from turning on,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
fusing those hands together,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
like the archaeopteryx.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
And the same goes for the tails.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
Birds have basically

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
rudimentary tails.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
And so we know

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
that in embryo,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
as the animal is developing,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
it actually has a relatively long tail.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
But a gene turns on

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
So that's the other gene we're looking for.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.260
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
So what we're trying to do really

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
is take our chicken,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
modify it

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
and make the chickenosaurus.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
(Laughter)

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
It's a cooler-looking chicken.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
But it's just the very basics.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
So that really is what we're doing.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
And people always say, "Why do that?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
Why make this thing?

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
What good is it?"

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
Well, that's a good question.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
about evolutionary biology

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
and developmental biology

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
and all sorts of things.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
And quite frankly, I think

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
if Colonel Sanders

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
was to be careful how he worded it,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
he could actually advertise an extra piece.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.260
(Laughter)

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
Anyway --

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.260
When our dino-chicken hatches,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
it will be, obviously, the poster child,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
or what you might call a poster chick,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
for technology, entertainment and design.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
Thank you.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
(Applause)
