00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:16.053
When we use the word "architect" or "designer,"

00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:18.852
what we usually mean is a professional,

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.324
someone who gets paid,

00:00:21.324 --> 00:00:24.247
and we tend to assume that it's those professionals

00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:26.228
who are going to be the ones to help us solve

00:00:26.228 --> 00:00:28.788
the really big, systemic design challenges that we face

00:00:28.788 --> 00:00:32.633
like climate change, urbanization and social inequality.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:35.717
That's our kind of working presumption.

00:00:35.717 --> 00:00:38.724
And I think it's wrong, actually.

00:00:38.724 --> 00:00:41.972
In 2008, I was just about to graduate from architecture school

00:00:41.972 --> 00:00:44.645
after several years, and go out and get a job,

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:47.570
and this happened.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.820
The economy ran out of jobs.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.275
And a couple of things struck me about this.

00:00:52.275 --> 00:00:56.005
One, don't listen to career advisers.

00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:00.661
And two, actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture,

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:04.931
which is that, as a society, we've never needed design thinking more,

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:08.889
and yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed.

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:12.440
It strikes me that we talk very deeply about design,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.556
but actually there's an economics behind architecture

00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:17.024
that we don't talk about, and I think we need to.

00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:20.655
And a good place to start is your own paycheck.

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:23.097
So, as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate,

00:01:23.097 --> 00:01:26.073
I might expect to earn about 24,000 pounds.

00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:29.689
That's about 36,000, 37,000 dollars.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.394
Now in terms of the whole world's population,

00:01:31.394 --> 00:01:36.276
that already puts me in the top 1.95 richest people,

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:40.036
which raises the question of, who is it I'm working for?

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:42.747
The uncomfortable fact is that

00:01:42.747 --> 00:01:45.631
actually almost everything that we call architecture today

00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:47.923
is actually the business of designing

00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:50.848
for about the richest one percent of the world's population,

00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:53.077
and it always has been.

00:01:53.077 --> 00:01:54.824
The reason why we forgot that

00:01:54.824 --> 00:01:56.927
is because the times in history when architecture

00:01:56.927 --> 00:01:59.852
did the most to transform society were those times

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:02.509
when, actually, the one percent would build

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.544
on behalf of the 99 percent, for various different reasons,

00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:08.159
whether that was through philanthropy in the 19th century,

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.429
communism in the early 20th,

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.467
the welfare state, and most recently, of course,

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:17.083
through this inflated real estate bubble.

00:02:17.083 --> 00:02:20.391
And all of those booms, in their own various ways,

00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:22.310
have now kicked the bucket,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.596
and we're back in this situation

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:29.512
where the smartest designers and architects in the world

00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:33.292
are only really able to work for one percent of the population.

00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:35.402
Now it's not just that that's bad for democracy,

00:02:35.402 --> 00:02:37.241
though I think it probably is,

00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:40.337
it's actually not a very clever business strategy, actually.

00:02:40.337 --> 00:02:43.196
I think the challenge facing the next generation of architects

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:45.238
is, how are we going to turn our client

00:02:45.238 --> 00:02:48.859
from the one percent to the 100 percent?

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.433
And I want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:54.275
for how it might be done.

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:57.657
The first is, I think we need to question this idea

00:02:57.657 --> 00:02:59.948
that architecture is about making buildings.

00:02:59.948 --> 00:03:02.692
Actually, a building is about the most expensive solution

00:03:02.692 --> 00:03:05.708
you can think of to almost any given problem.

00:03:05.708 --> 00:03:08.236
And fundamentally, design should be much, much more interested

00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:10.968
in solving problems and creating new conditions.

00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:12.490
So here's a story.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.088
The office was working with a school,

00:03:14.088 --> 00:03:16.514
and they had an old Victorian school building.

00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:19.245
And they said to the architects, "Look,

00:03:19.245 --> 00:03:21.198
our corridors are an absolute nightmare.

00:03:21.198 --> 00:03:23.564
They're far too small. They get congested between classes.

00:03:23.564 --> 00:03:25.947
There's bullying. We can't control them.

00:03:25.947 --> 00:03:28.789
So what we want you to do is re-plan our entire building,

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.979
and we know it's going to cost several million pounds,

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:32.890
but we're reconciled to the fact."

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.596
And the team thought about this, and they went away,

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:37.613
and they said, "Actually, don't do that.

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:40.393
Instead, get rid of the school bell.

00:03:40.393 --> 00:03:43.222
And instead of having one school bell that goes off once,

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:45.480
have several smaller school bells that go off

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.728
in different places and different times,

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.976
distribute the traffic through the corridors."

00:03:49.976 --> 00:03:51.393
It solves the same problem,

00:03:51.393 --> 00:03:54.201
but instead of spending several million pounds,

00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:56.344
you spend several hundred pounds.

00:03:56.344 --> 00:03:59.144
Now, it looks like you're doing yourself out of a job,

00:03:59.144 --> 00:04:01.705
but you're not. You're actually making yourself more useful.

00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:03.178
Architects are actually really, really good

00:04:03.178 --> 00:04:05.520
at this kind of resourceful, strategic thinking.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.482
And the problem is that, like a lot of design professions,

00:04:07.482 --> 00:04:09.665
we got fixated on the idea of providing

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:11.946
a particular kind of consumer product,

00:04:11.946 --> 00:04:14.416
and I don't think that needs to be the case anymore.

00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:18.617
The second idea worth questioning is this 20th-century thing

00:04:18.617 --> 00:04:21.878
that mass architecture is about big --

00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:24.472
big buildings and big finance.

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:26.561
Actually, we've got ourselves locked into this

00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:28.968
Industrial Era mindset which says that

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:32.454
the only people who can make cities are large organizations

00:04:32.454 --> 00:04:34.972
or corporations who build on our behalf,

00:04:34.972 --> 00:04:36.780
procuring whole neighborhoods

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.213
in single, monolithic projects, and of course,

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:42.432
form follows finance.

00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:45.456
So what you end up with are single, monolithic neighborhoods

00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:49.144
based on this kind of one-size-fits-all model.

00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:51.657
And a lot of people can't even afford them.

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:54.624
But what if, actually, it's possible now for cities

00:04:54.624 --> 00:04:57.394
to be made not just by the few with a lot

00:04:57.394 --> 00:05:00.582
but also by the many with a bit?

00:05:00.582 --> 00:05:01.876
And when they do, they bring with them

00:05:01.876 --> 00:05:05.215
a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live.

00:05:05.215 --> 00:05:07.319
And it raises really interesting questions about,

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.602
how will we plan cities? How will finance development?

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.263
How will we sell design services?

00:05:12.263 --> 00:05:14.503
What would it mean for democratic societies

00:05:14.503 --> 00:05:16.903
to offer their citizens a right to build?

00:05:16.903 --> 00:05:19.183
And in a way it should be kind of obvious, right,

00:05:19.183 --> 00:05:24.652
that in the 21st century, maybe cities can be developed by citizens.

00:05:24.652 --> 00:05:27.816
And thirdly, we need to remember that,

00:05:27.816 --> 00:05:30.167
from a strictly economic point of view,

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:35.013
design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly --

00:05:35.013 --> 00:05:37.609
mostly it's done by amateurs.

00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:39.495
And that's a good thing.

00:05:39.495 --> 00:05:42.965
Most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy

00:05:42.965 --> 00:05:45.025
in what's called the social economy or the core economy,

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:47.417
which is people doing it for themselves.

00:05:47.417 --> 00:05:50.665
And the problem is that, up until now,

00:05:50.665 --> 00:05:52.467
it was the monetary economy which had

00:05:52.467 --> 00:05:54.625
all the infrastructure and all the tools.

00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:56.448
So the challenge we face is, how are we going

00:05:56.448 --> 00:05:59.682
to build the tools, the infrastructure and the institutions

00:05:59.682 --> 00:06:01.422
for architecture's social economy?

00:06:01.422 --> 00:06:04.154
And that began with open-source software.

00:06:04.154 --> 00:06:06.522
And over the last few years, it's been moving

00:06:06.522 --> 00:06:09.017
into the physical world with open-source hardware,

00:06:09.017 --> 00:06:10.547
which are freely shared blueprints

00:06:10.547 --> 00:06:14.593
that anyone can download and make for themselves.

00:06:14.593 --> 00:06:17.834
And that's where 3D printing gets really, really interesting.

00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:21.370
Right? When suddenly you had a 3D printer

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.924
that was open-source, the parts for which

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.205
could be made on another 3D printer.

00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:28.266
Or the same idea here, which is for a CNC machine,

00:06:28.266 --> 00:06:32.762
which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood.

00:06:32.762 --> 00:06:35.576
What these technologies are doing is radically

00:06:35.576 --> 00:06:38.657
lowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill.

00:06:38.657 --> 00:06:40.239
They're challenging the idea that

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:44.065
if you want something to be affordable it's got to be one-size-fits-all.

00:06:44.065 --> 00:06:46.398
And they're distributing massively

00:06:46.398 --> 00:06:49.285
really complex manufacturing capabilities.

00:06:49.285 --> 00:06:53.416
We're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere,

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:54.611
and increasingly that means

00:06:54.611 --> 00:06:57.898
that the design team is everyone.

00:06:57.898 --> 00:07:00.424
That really is an industrial revolution.

00:07:00.424 --> 00:07:03.640
And when we think that the major ideological conflicts

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.658
that we inherited were all based around this question

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:07.570
of who should control the means of production,

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.297
and these technologies are coming back with a solution:

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:14.286
actually, maybe no one. All of us.

00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:16.455
And we were fascinated by

00:07:16.455 --> 00:07:19.062
what that might mean for architecture.

00:07:19.062 --> 00:07:21.584
So about a year and a half ago,

00:07:21.584 --> 00:07:23.480
we started working on a project called WikiHouse,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.754
and WikiHouse is an open-source construction system.

00:07:26.754 --> 00:07:29.552
And the idea is to make it possible for anyone

00:07:29.552 --> 00:07:31.936
to go online, access a freely shared library

00:07:31.936 --> 00:07:36.397
of 3D models which they can download and adapt in,

00:07:36.397 --> 00:07:39.788
at the moment, SketchUp, because it's free, and it's easy to use,

00:07:39.788 --> 00:07:42.347
and almost at the click of a switch

00:07:42.347 --> 00:07:44.831
they can generate a set of cutting files

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:46.872
which allow them, in effect,

00:07:46.872 --> 00:07:50.060
to print out the parts from a house using a CNC machine

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.271
and a standard sheet material like plywood.

00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:56.391
And the parts are all numbered,

00:07:56.391 --> 00:08:00.568
and basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit.

00:08:00.568 --> 00:08:02.839
(Laughter)

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:05.105
And it goes together without any bolts.

00:08:05.105 --> 00:08:07.295
It uses wedge and peg connections.

00:08:07.295 --> 00:08:09.439
And even the mallets to make it

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:11.919
can be provided on the cutting sheets as well.

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:14.456
And a team of about two or three people,

00:08:14.456 --> 00:08:16.495
working together, can build this.

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.975
They don't need any traditional construction skills.

00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:22.126
They don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that,

00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:24.639
and they can build a small house of about this size

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:29.403
in about a day.

00:08:29.403 --> 00:08:36.680
(Applause)

00:08:36.706 --> 00:08:39.701
And what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house

00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:42.160
onto which you can then apply systems like windows

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.218
and cladding and insulation and services

00:08:44.218 --> 00:08:47.267
based on what's cheap and what's available.

00:08:47.267 --> 00:08:49.452
Of course, the house is never finished.

00:08:49.452 --> 00:08:52.333
We're shifting our heads here, so the house is not a finished product.

00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:55.090
With the CNC machine, you can make new parts for it

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.947
over its life or even use it to make the house next door.

00:08:58.947 --> 00:09:02.385
So we can begin to see the seed of a completely open-source,

00:09:02.385 --> 00:09:06.660
citizen-led urban development model, potentially.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.210
And we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now,

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.331
and some really interesting lessons here.

00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:14.658
One of them is that it's always incredibly sociable.

00:09:14.658 --> 00:09:19.356
People get confused between construction work and having fun.

00:09:19.356 --> 00:09:22.015
But the principles of openness go right down

00:09:22.015 --> 00:09:24.821
into the really mundane, physical details.

00:09:24.821 --> 00:09:27.824
Like, never designing a piece that can't be lifted up.

00:09:27.824 --> 00:09:29.123
Or, when you're designing a piece,

00:09:29.123 --> 00:09:32.003
make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round,

00:09:32.003 --> 00:09:34.956
or, if you do, it doesn't matter, because it's symmetrical.

00:09:34.956 --> 00:09:38.998
Probably the principal which runs deepest with us

00:09:38.998 --> 00:09:41.953
is the principal set out by Linus Torvalds,

00:09:41.953 --> 00:09:44.678
the open-source pioneer,

00:09:44.678 --> 00:09:47.967
which was that idea of, "Be lazy like a fox."

00:09:47.967 --> 00:09:49.676
Don't reinvent the wheel every time.

00:09:49.676 --> 00:09:53.469
Take what already works, and adapt it for your own needs.

00:09:53.469 --> 00:09:56.052
Contrary to almost everything that you might get taught

00:09:56.052 --> 00:10:00.149
at an architecture school, copying is good.

00:10:00.149 --> 00:10:02.150
Which is appropriate, because actually,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.930
this approach is not innovative.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.539
It's actually how we built buildings

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:08.035
for hundreds of years before the Industrial Revolution

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:10.462
in these sorts of community barn-raisings.

00:10:10.462 --> 00:10:12.606
The only difference between traditional

00:10:12.606 --> 00:10:15.014
vernacular architecture and open-source architecture

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:17.134
might be a web connection,

00:10:17.134 --> 00:10:19.946
but it's a really, really big difference.

00:10:19.946 --> 00:10:21.377
We shared the whole of WikiHouse

00:10:21.377 --> 00:10:23.219
under a Creative Commons license,

00:10:23.219 --> 00:10:24.641
and now what's just beginning to happen

00:10:24.641 --> 00:10:26.623
is that groups around the world are beginning to take it

00:10:26.623 --> 00:10:29.362
and use it and hack it and tinker with it, and it's amazing.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:32.327
There's a cool group over in Christchurch in New Zealand

00:10:32.327 --> 00:10:35.462
looking at post-earthquake development housing,

00:10:35.462 --> 00:10:38.710
and thanks to the TED city Prize,

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.449
we're working with an awesome group in one of Rio's favelas

00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:43.938
to set up a kind of community factory

00:10:43.938 --> 00:10:45.852
and micro-university.

00:10:45.852 --> 00:10:47.716
These are very, very small beginnings,

00:10:47.716 --> 00:10:50.591
and actually there's more people in the last week

00:10:50.591 --> 00:10:52.774
who have got in touch and they're not even on this map.

00:10:52.774 --> 00:10:56.514
I hope next time you see it, you won't even be able to see the map.

00:10:56.514 --> 00:11:00.963
We're aware that WikiHouse is a very, very small answer,

00:11:00.963 --> 00:11:04.535
but it's a small answer to a really, really big question,

00:11:04.535 --> 00:11:08.311
which is that globally, right now, the fastest-growing cities

00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:10.542
are not skyscraper cities.

00:11:10.542 --> 00:11:14.638
They're self-made cities in one form or another.

00:11:14.638 --> 00:11:18.262
If we're talking about the 21st-century city,

00:11:18.262 --> 00:11:20.886
these are the guys who are going to be making it.

00:11:20.886 --> 00:11:25.368
You know, like it or not, welcome to the world's biggest design team.

00:11:25.368 --> 00:11:27.494
So if we're serious about problems

00:11:27.494 --> 00:11:31.648
like climate change, urbanization and health,

00:11:31.648 --> 00:11:35.546
actually, our existing development models aren't going to do it.

00:11:35.546 --> 00:11:37.634
As I think Robert Neuwirth said, there isn't a bank

00:11:37.634 --> 00:11:40.411
or a corporation or a government or an NGO

00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:41.797
who's going to be able to do it

00:11:41.797 --> 00:11:45.446
if we treat citizens only as consumers.

00:11:45.446 --> 00:11:49.227
How extraordinary would it be, though, if collectively

00:11:49.227 --> 00:11:51.500
we were to develop solutions not just to the problem

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.914
of structure that we've been working on,

00:11:53.914 --> 00:11:58.634
but to infrastructure problems like solar-powered air conditioning,

00:11:58.634 --> 00:12:01.450
off-grid energy, off-grid sanitation --

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.379
low-cost, open-source, high-performance solutions

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:07.319
that anyone can very, very easily make,

00:12:07.319 --> 00:12:09.220
and to put them all into a commons

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.568
where they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone?

00:12:13.568 --> 00:12:17.738
A kind of Wikipedia for stuff?

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:19.779
And once something's in the commons,

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:21.135
it will always be there.

00:12:21.135 --> 00:12:24.663
How much would that change the rules?

00:12:24.663 --> 00:12:28.099
And I think the technology's on our side.

00:12:28.099 --> 00:12:31.759
If design's great project in the 20th century

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:35.520
was the democratization of consumption --

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:41.946
that was Henry Ford, Levittown, Coca-Cola, IKEA —

00:12:41.946 --> 00:12:45.568
I think design's great project in the 21st century

00:12:45.568 --> 00:12:48.440
is the democratization of production.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.120
And when it comes to architecture in cities,

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.192
that really matters.

00:12:53.192 --> 00:12:54.946
Thank you very much.

00:12:54.946 --> 00:13:00.070
(Applause)
