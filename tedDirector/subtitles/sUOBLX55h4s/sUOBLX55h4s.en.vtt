00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
My mission in life since I was a kid was,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
and is, to take the rest of you into space.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.330
It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.330
take the people of Earth and transition off, permanently. And that's exciting.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
In fact, I think it is a moral imperative

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
that we open the space frontier.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
You know, it's the first time that we're going to have a chance

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
to have planetary redundancy,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
a chance to, if you would, back up the biosphere.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
And if you think about space,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
everything we hold of value on this planet --

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.330
metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.330
In fact, the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.330
The analogy for me is Alaska. You know, we bought Alaska.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.330
We Americans bought Alaska in the 1850s. It's called Seward's folly.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.330
We valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.330
And then we discovered these things -- gold and oil and fishing and timber --

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
and it became, you know, a trillion-dollar economy,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
and now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
We are on the verge of the greatest exploration

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
that the human race has ever known.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
We explore for three reasons,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
the weakest of which is curiosity.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
You know, it's funded NASA's budget up until now.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
Some images from Mars, 1997.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
In fact, I think in the next decade, without any question,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.330
we will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
under the soils and different parts of that planet.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
The stronger motivator, the much stronger motivator, is fear.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.330
It drove us to the moon. We -- literally in fear -- with the Soviet Union

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.330
raced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.330
you know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
and while the probability is very small,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
the impact, figured in literally,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
of one of these hitting the Earth is so huge

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
that to spend a small fraction looking, searching,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
preparing to defend, is not unreasonable.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
And of course, the third motivator,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.330
one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.330
In fact, the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
there's a class of the nickel iron,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
which in platinum-group metal markets alone

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
are worth something like 20 trillion dollars,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
if you can go out and grab one of these rocks.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
My plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
and then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
And that will fund the actual mission to go and get one.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
But fear, curiosity and greed have driven us.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.330
And for me, this is -- I'm the short kid on the right.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.330
This was -- my motivation was actually during Apollo.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
And Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.330
If you think about what happened at the turn of -- early 1960s,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.330
on May 25, JFK said, "We're going to go to the moon."

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
And people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.330
to go and be part of this amazing mission.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
And we knew nothing about going to space.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
to going to the moon in eight years,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.330
and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.330
They didn't know what couldn't be done.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
They had to make up everything.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
And that, my friend, is amazing motivation.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
This is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.330
"If I can go to the moon" -- this is the last human on the moon so far --

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
"nothing, nothing is impossible." But of course,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.330
we've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.330
But I put forward here, the government is not going to get us there.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.330
The government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.330
That's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.330
We shouldn't be happy in standing for that.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
One of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.330
was take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
we should be allowed to risk.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
In fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.330
just needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.330
in fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
and clearly the industrial-military complex --

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.330
with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA -- are the dinosaurs.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
The ability for us to access these resources

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
to gain planetary redundancy --

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
we can now gather all the information, the genetic codes,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
you know, everything stored on our databases,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
and back them up off the planet,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.330
in case there would be one of those disastrous situations.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.330
The difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
Once you're in orbit, you are two thirds of the way, energetically, to anywhere --

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
the moon, to Mars. And today,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.330
there's only three vehicles -- the U.S. shuttle, the Russian Soyuz

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.330
and the Chinese vehicle -- that gets you there.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.330
Arguably, it's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
One of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.330
We've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
to go up to the space station for 20 million dollars.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.330
But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is --

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
(Laughter) --

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
it is expensive. But people are willing to pay that!

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.330
You know, one -- we have a very unique period in time today.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
For the first time ever, we have enough wealth

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
concentrated in the hands of few individuals

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
and the technology accessible

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.330
that will allow us to really drive space exploration.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.330
But how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
We know -- 20 million dollars today, you can go and buy a ticket,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
but how cheap could it get?

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.330
Let's go back to high school physics here.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.330
If you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.330
and then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour --

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.330
remember, that one half MV squared -- and you figure it out.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.330
It's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.330
If you expended that over an hour, it's about 1.6 megawatts.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
If you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour --

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
anybody here fast in math?

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.330
How much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit?

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.330
100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that --

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
I'll grant you that.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.330
(Laughter)

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.330
But guys, if history has taught us anything,

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.330
it's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
I have no question that the physics,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
the engineering to get us down to the point

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.330
where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.330
The difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.330
Today, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
of their own money in R&amp;D.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
It's all government research dollars, and very few of those.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
And in fact, the large corporations,

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
the governments, can't take the risk.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.330
So we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.330
Today's commercial markets worldwide, global commercial launch market?

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.330
12 to 15 launches per year.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
Number of commercial companies out there? 12 to 15 companies.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.330
One per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
and I call them self-loading carbon payloads.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
They come with their own money. They're easy to make.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.330
It's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.330
reading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
We offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
carry three people up to 100 kilometers,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
come back down, and within two weeks, make the trip again.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.330
Twenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition,

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
spending between one to 25 million dollars each.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
And of course, we had beautiful SpaceShipOne,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.330
which made those two flights and won the competition.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.330
And I'd like to take you there, to that morning,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
for just a quick video.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
(Video) Pilot: Release our fire.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:31.330
Richard Searfoss: Good luck.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:38.330
(Applause)

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:54.330
RS: We've got an altitude call of 368,000 feet.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.330
(Applause)

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
RS: So in my official capacity as the chief judge

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
of the Ansari X PRIZE competition,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
I declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
has indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
(Applause)

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
Peter Diamandis: Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
was raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.330
We went -- I went to 100, 200 CEOs, CMOs.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
No one believed it was done. Everyone said, "Oh, what does NASA think?

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
Well, people are going to die,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
how can you possibly going to put this forward?"

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.330
I found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car,

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
and raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.330
And what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
and buying a hole-in-one insurance policy.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
See, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
and said, "Are you going to compete?" No.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
"Are you going to compete?" No. "No one's going to win this thing."

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:47.330
So, they took a bet that no one would win by January of '05,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.330
and I took a bet that someone would win.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.330
(Applause)

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:58.330
So -- and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.330
(Laughter)

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
We've had a lot of accomplishments

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
and it's been a tremendous success.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:09.330
One of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
is going to hang in Air and Space Museum,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
next to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:18.330
Isn't that great? (Applause)

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.330
So a little bit about the future, steps to space, what's available for you.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.330
Today, you can go and experience weightless flights.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.330
By '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
is going to be about 200,000.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.330
There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly,

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.330
I think, to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
Orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.330
And then I truly believe, once a group is in orbit around the Earth --

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
I know if they don't do it, I am --

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
we're going to stockpile some fuel,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.330
(Laughter)

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
Quick moment for the designers in the audience.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.330
We spent 11 years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
Here are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.330
and my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity --

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
people think a zero gravity room,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
there's a switch on there that turns it off --

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
but it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:17.330
And turns out 7-Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
If we can get the audio up?

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.330
(Video) Narrator: For a chance to win the first free ticket to space,

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.330
look for specially marked packages of Diet 7-Up.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
When you want the taste that won't weigh you down,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
the only way to go is up.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:36.330
PD: That was filmed inside our airplane, and so, you can now do this.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
We're based down in Florida.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.330
The future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
I had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.330
and the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.330
And we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.330
to actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
and we just took on a new mission statement:

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
"to bring about radical breakthroughs in space

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
and other technologies for the benefit of humanity."

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.330
And this is something that we're very excited about.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.330
I showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
And you know, when you give to a nonprofit,

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
you might have 50 cents on the dollar.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.330
If you have a matching grant, it's typically two or three to one.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:23.330
If you put up a prize, you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.330
And that's huge. And then he turned around and said,

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.330
"Well, if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize, you get 500 to one."

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.330
I said, "Well, that's great."

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
So, we have actually -- are looking to turn the X PRIZE

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
into a world-class prize institute.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.330
This is what happens when you put up a prize,

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.330
when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.330
You get publicity increase, and when it's won,

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.330
publicity shoots through the roof -- if it's properly managed --

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.330
and that's part of the benefits to a sponsor.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.330
Then, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving,

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.330
you get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
And the benefit to the sponsors

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
That's our value proposition in a prize.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
If you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne,

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
or any kind of a new technology,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330
you have to fund that from the beginning

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.330
and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.330
It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize,

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.330
the beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.330
and you pay on success.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
Orteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across --

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
tried to go across the Atlantic,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
and we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
So, prizes work great.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
You know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
you know that when you're going for a goal,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
the first thing you have to do is believe

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
that you can do it yourself.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.330
Then, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridicule

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
of -- that's a crazy idea, it'll never work.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.330
And then you have to convince others,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
so that they can, in fact, help you raise the funds,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.330
and then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.330
and institutions that don't want you to move those things forward,

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
and you have to deal with failures. What a prize does,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
what we've experienced a prize doing,

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:09.330
is literally help to short-circuit or support all of these things,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
because a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.330
Well, it must be a good idea.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.330
Someone's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.330
And each of these areas was something that we found

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:24.330
the Ansari X PRIZE helped short-circuit these for innovation.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
So, as an organization, we put together a prize discovery process

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.330
of how to come up with prizes and write the rules,

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.330
and we're actually looking at creating prizes

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.330
in a number of different categories.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:40.330
We're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology --

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
and I'll talk about those more in a moment.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
And the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.330
within the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
We're going after an orbital prize.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.330
We are looking at a number of energy prizes.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.330
Craig Venter has just joined our board

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.330
and we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.330
we'll be announcing later this fall,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:02.330
about -- imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.330
for under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:10.330
And clean water, education, medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.330
So my final slide here is, the most critical tool

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.330
for solving humanity's grand challenges -- it isn't technology,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.330
it isn't money, it's only one thing --

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.330
it's the committed, passionate human mind.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.330
(Applause)
