00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.096
Roy Price is a man that most of you
have probably never heard about,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.616
even though he may have been responsible

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.536
for 22 somewhat mediocre 
minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.736
He may have also been responsible
for 22 very entertaining minutes,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.016
but not very many of you.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.936
And all of that goes back to a decision

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.960
that Roy had to make
about three years ago.

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:40.816
So you see, Roy Price
is a senior executive with Amazon Studios.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.856
That's the TV production
company of Amazon.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.136
He's 47 years old, slim, spiky hair,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.976
describes himself on Twitter
as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.176
And Roy Price has a very responsible job,
because it's his responsibility

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.256
to pick the shows, the original content
that Amazon is going to make.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.616
And of course that's
a highly competitive space.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.376
I mean, there are so many
TV shows already out there,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.576
that Roy can't just choose any show.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.696
He has to find shows
that are really, really great.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.536
So in other words, he has to find shows

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.936
that are on the very right end
of this curve here.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.616
So this curve here
is the rating distribution

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.016
of about 2,500 TV shows
on the website IMDB,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.936
and the rating goes from one to 10,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.936
and the height here shows you
how many shows get that rating.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.656
So if your show gets a rating
of nine points or higher, that's a winner.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.496
Then you have a top two percent show.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.416
That's shows like "Breaking Bad,"
"Game of Thrones," "The Wire,"

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.736
so all of these shows that are addictive,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.816
whereafter you've watched a season,
your brain is basically like,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.016
"Where can I get more of these episodes?"

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.240
That kind of show.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.416
On the left side, just for clarity,
here on that end,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.616
you have a show called
"Toddlers and Tiaras" --

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.296
(Laughter)

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.856
-- which should tell you enough

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.071
about what's going on
on that end of the curve.

00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:07.256
Now, Roy Price is not worried about
getting on the left end of the curve,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.216
because I think you would have to have
some serious brainpower

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.936
to undercut "Toddlers and Tiaras."

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.896
So what he's worried about
is this middle bulge here,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.736
the bulge of average TV,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.616
you know, those shows
that aren't really good or really bad,

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.295
they don't really get you excited.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.176
So he needs to make sure
that he's really on the right end of this.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.776
So the pressure is on,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.976
and of course it's also the first time

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.176
that Amazon is even
doing something like this,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.536
so Roy Price does not want
to take any chances.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.016
He wants to engineer success.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.816
He needs a guaranteed success,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.416
and so what he does is,
he holds a competition.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.576
So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.896
and from those ideas,
through an evaluation,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.016
they select eight candidates for TV shows,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.256
and then he just makes the first episode
of each one of these shows

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.416
and puts them online for free
for everyone to watch.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.696
And so when Amazon
is giving out free stuff,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.256
you're going to take it, right?

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.416
So millions of viewers
are watching those episodes.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.656
What they don't realize is that,
while they're watching their shows,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.976
actually, they are being watched.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.336
They are being watched
by Roy Price and his team,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.736
who record everything.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.136
They record when somebody presses play,
when somebody presses pause,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.696
what parts they skip,
what parts they watch again.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.976
So they collect millions of data points,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.096
because they want
to have those data points

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.816
to then decide
which show they should make.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.016
And sure enough,
so they collect all the data,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.616
they do all the data crunching,
and an answer emerges,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.856
and the answer is,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.416
"Amazon should do a sitcom
about four Republican US Senators."

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.656
They did that show.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.840
So does anyone know the name of the show?

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.016
(Audience: "Alpha House.")

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.496
Yes, "Alpha House,"

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.616
but it seems like not too many of you here
remember that show, actually,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.496
because it didn't turn out that great.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.376
It's actually just an average show,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.976
actually -- literally, in fact, because
the average of this curve here is at 7.4,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.416
and "Alpha House" lands at 7.5,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.456
so a slightly above average show,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.400
but certainly not what Roy Price
and his team were aiming for.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.176
Meanwhile, however,
at about the same time,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.776
at another company,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.016
another executive did manage
to land a top show using data analysis,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.616
and his name is Ted,

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.056
Ted Sarandos, who is
the Chief Content Officer of Netflix,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.216
and just like Roy,
he's on a constant mission

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.736
to find that great TV show,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.776
and he uses data as well to do that,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.815
except he does it
a little bit differently.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:35.576
So instead of holding a competition,
what he did -- and his team of course --

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.136
was they looked at all the data
they already had about Netflix viewers,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.256
you know, the ratings
they give their shows,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.976
the viewing histories,
what shows people like, and so on.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.896
And then they use that data to discover

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.536
all of these little bits and pieces
about the audience:

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.016
what kinds of shows they like,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.136
what kind of producers,
what kind of actors.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.736
And once they had
all of these pieces together,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.416
they took a leap of faith,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.536
and they decided to license

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.016
not a sitcom about four Senators

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.920
but a drama series about a single Senator.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.416
You guys know the show?

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.736
(Laughter)

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.496
Yes, "House of Cards," and Netflix
of course, nailed it with that show,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.656
at least for the first two seasons.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.656
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.856
"House of Cards" gets
a 9.1 rating on this curve,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.056
so it's exactly
where they wanted it to be.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.496
Now, the question of course is,
what happened here?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.176
So you have two very competitive,
data-savvy companies.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.056
They connect all of these
millions of data points,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.456
and then it works
beautifully for one of them,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.336
and it doesn't work for the other one.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.576
So why?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.056
Because logic kind of tells you
that this should be working all the time.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.536
I mean, if you're collecting
millions of data points

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.296
on a decision you're going to make,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.936
then you should be able
to make a pretty good decision.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.176
You have 200 years
of statistics to rely on.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.216
You're amplifying it
with very powerful computers.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.520
The least you could expect
is good TV, right?

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.600
And if data analysis
does not work that way,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.576
then it actually gets a little scary,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.416
because we live in a time
where we're turning to data more and more

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.920
to make very serious decisions
that go far beyond TV.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.000
Does anyone here know the company
Multi-Health Systems?

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.736
No one. OK, that's good actually.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.976
OK, so Multi-Health Systems
is a software company,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.816
and I hope that nobody here in this room

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.016
ever comes into contact
with that software,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.136
because if you do,
it means you're in prison.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.336
(Laughter)

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.896
If someone here in the US is in prison,
and they apply for parole,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.216
then it's very likely that
data analysis software from that company

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.856
will be used in determining
whether to grant that parole.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.456
So it's the same principle
as Amazon and Netflix,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.096
but now instead of deciding whether
a TV show is going to be good or bad,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.016
you're deciding whether a person
is going to be good or bad.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.536
And mediocre TV, 22 minutes,
that can be pretty bad,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.200
but more years in prison,
I guess, even worse.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.496
And unfortunately, there is actually
some evidence that this data analysis,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.736
despite having lots of data,
does not always produce optimum results.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.482
And that's not because a company
like Multi-Health Systems

00:07:13.506 --> 00:07:15.133
doesn't know what to do with data.

00:07:15.158 --> 00:07:17.456
Even the most data-savvy
companies get it wrong.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.880
Yes, even Google gets it wrong sometimes.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.176
In 2009, Google announced
that they were able, with data analysis,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.336
to predict outbreaks of influenza,
the nasty kind of flu,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.136
by doing data analysis
on their Google searches.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.016
And it worked beautifully,
and it made a big splash in the news,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.176
including the pinnacle
of scientific success:

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.656
a publication in the journal "Nature."

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.296
It worked beautifully
for year after year after year,

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.976
until one year it failed.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.256
And nobody could even tell exactly why.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.976
It just didn't work that year,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.936
and of course that again made big news,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.576
including now a retraction

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.440
of a publication
from the journal "Nature."

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.816
So even the most data-savvy companies,
Amazon and Google,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.976
they sometimes get it wrong.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.936
And despite all those failures,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.816
data is moving rapidly
into real-life decision-making --

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.656
into the workplace,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.496
law enforcement,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.720
medicine.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.736
So we should better make sure
that data is helping.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.896
Now, personally I've seen
a lot of this struggle with data myself,

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.896
because I work in computational genetics,

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.416
which is also a field
where lots of very smart people

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.096
are using unimaginable amounts of data
to make pretty serious decisions

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.680
like deciding on a cancer therapy
or developing a drug.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.896
And over the years,
I've noticed a sort of pattern

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.376
or kind of rule, if you will,
about the difference

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.096
between successful
decision-making with data

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.736
and unsuccessful decision-making,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.640
and I find this a pattern worth sharing,
and it goes something like this.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.655
So whenever you're
solving a complex problem,

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:54.416
you're doing essentially two things.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.736
The first one is, you take that problem
apart into its bits and pieces

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.256
so that you can deeply analyze
those bits and pieces,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.296
and then of course
you do the second part.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.976
You put all of these bits and pieces
back together again

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.336
to come to your conclusion.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.696
And sometimes you
have to do it over again,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.376
but it's always those two things:

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.720
taking apart and putting
back together again.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.896
And now the crucial thing is

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.816
that data and data analysis

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.336
is only good for the first part.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.576
Data and data analysis,
no matter how powerful,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.056
can only help you taking a problem apart
and understanding its pieces.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.576
It's not suited to put those pieces
back together again

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.496
and then to come to a conclusion.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.256
There's another tool that can do that,
and we all have it,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.576
and that tool is the brain.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.536
If there's one thing a brain is good at,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.816
it's taking bits and pieces
back together again,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.856
even when you have incomplete information,

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.456
and coming to a good conclusion,

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.416
especially if it's the brain of an expert.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.096
And that's why I believe
that Netflix was so successful,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.696
because they used data and brains
where they belong in the process.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.256
They use data to first understand
lots of pieces about their audience

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.696
that they otherwise wouldn't have
been able to understand at that depth,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.336
but then the decision
to take all these bits and pieces

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.696
and put them back together again
and make a show like "House of Cards,"

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.136
that was nowhere in the data.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.136
Ted Sarandos and his team
made that decision to license that show,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.541
which also meant, by the way,
that they were taking

00:10:15.565 --> 00:10:18.416
a pretty big personal risk
with that decision.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.456
And Amazon, on the other hand,
they did it the wrong way around.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.216
They used data all the way
to drive their decision-making,

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.656
first when they held
their competition of TV ideas,

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.376
then when they selected "Alpha House"
to make as a show.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.896
Which of course was
a very safe decision for them,

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.376
because they could always
point at the data, saying,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.096
"This is what the data tells us."

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.360
But it didn't lead to the exceptional
results that they were hoping for.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.096
So data is of course a massively
useful tool to make better decisions,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.496
but I believe that things go wrong

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.096
when data is starting
to drive those decisions.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.896
No matter how powerful,
data is just a tool,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.256
and to keep that in mind,
I find this device here quite useful.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.496
Many of you will ...

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.736
(Laughter)

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.976
Before there was data,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.856
this was the decision-making
device to use.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.136
(Laughter)

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.496
Many of you will know this.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.473
This toy here is called the Magic 8 Ball,

00:11:10.497 --> 00:11:11.696
and it's really amazing,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.616
because if you have a decision to make,
a yes or no question,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.376
all you have to do is you shake the ball,
and then you get an answer --

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.216
"Most Likely" -- right here
in this window in real time.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.336
I'll have it out later for tech demos.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.576
(Laughter)

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.176
Now, the thing is, of course --
so I've made some decisions in my life

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.096
where, in hindsight,
I should have just listened to the ball.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.456
But, you know, of course,
if you have the data available,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.536
you want to replace this with something
much more sophisticated,

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.176
like data analysis
to come to a better decision.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.816
But that does not change the basic setup.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.016
So the ball may get smarter
and smarter and smarter,

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.856
but I believe it's still on us
to make the decisions

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.896
if we want to achieve
something extraordinary,

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.856
on the right end of the curve.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.376
And I find that a very encouraging
message, in fact,

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.376
that even in the face
of huge amounts of data,

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.496
it still pays off to make decisions,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.176
to be an expert in what you're doing

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.296
and take risks.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.096
Because in the end, it's not data,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.080
it's risks that will land you
on the right end of the curve.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.056
Thank you.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.760
(Applause)
