00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.160
(Applause)

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.160
It's really quite an honor to be here tonight,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.160
and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
because I've really been inspired.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.160
And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
that are, literally, world premieres.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
I've been working on my new record

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
and I've never played these songs for anybody

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
except the microphone.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
This is a song that I wrote

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.160
about the meaning of technology,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
which goes perfectly with this gathering.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
I started thinking about -- when I was in college,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
especially as a blind person,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.160
doing a research paper was a major undertaking.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
You had to go to the library,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
see if you could get them to find the books for you,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
you know, footnotes and all that.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
I wish I had that when I was in college.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
Anyway, this is a song about:

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.160
we have all this, but what are we going to do with it?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
It's called "All the Answers."

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
♫ What is the weather in Cincinnati? ♫

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
♫ What is the time in Tokyo? ♫

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
♫ Who is this little child's daddy? ♫

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
♫ And who the hell needs to know? ♫

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
♫ Why do memories of you linger ♫

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
♫ when I'm trying to reach my goal? ♫

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
♫ And why must I move my fingers ♫

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
♫ to the music in my soul? ♫

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
♫ I don't know. ♫

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160

♫ Oh, it's good to be so free, ♫

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
♫ so free. ♫

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
♫ Who was mayor of Chicago ♫

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
♫ back in 1964? ♫

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
♫ And why did Shakespeare create Iago ♫

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
♫ to tear apart a love so pure? ♫

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
♫ How can my dreams be so vivid ♫

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
♫ in a psychosonic way? ♫

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
♫ Why must I become so livid ♫

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
♫ about the news I hear today? ♫

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
♫ I don't know. ♫

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
♫ I don't have to know. ♫

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160

♫ Uh-huh ... ♫

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
♫ But I tell you what I'm going to do: ♫

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
♫ I'm going to find the capitol of Peru ♫

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
♫ or the latitude of Kathmandu. ♫

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
♫ I'm gonna Google it ♫

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
♫ 'cause everybody's doing it. ♫

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.160
♫ And then I'll rummage through the century. ♫

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:37.160
♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.160
♫ I got all the answers. ♫

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
♫ Yeah, yeah ♫

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:53.160
♫ I got all the answers. ♫

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:03.160
(Applause)

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
Thank you.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.160
Whew! It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
That's the first time I've ever played it.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
(Applause)

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.160
It's a "feel the fear and do it anyway" kind of thing.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
This next song is a song

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
that started out as a dream -- a childhood dream.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
It was one of the titles

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.160
that I was sort of thinking about calling my record,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
except there's a couple of problems.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
One thing is, it's unpronounceable.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
And it's a made-up word.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
It's called "Tembererana."

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
And the song is based on

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
what I think was my first

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
childhood attempts

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
to think about invisible forces.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.160
So "tembererana" was these dreams,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.160
in which I would be running away

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
from bad feelings -- is the only way I can put it.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.160
So this is called "Tembererana."

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
It's based on an Argentinian rhythm

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
called "carnivalito."

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.160
♫ A dream within a dream, ♫

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.160
♫ a world within a world, ♫

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
♫ the sound of a primal scream ♫

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
♫ travels out across the land. ♫

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
♫ Images flickering, ♫

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
♫ the sound of the war machine, ♫

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.160
♫ a procession of limousines ♫

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
♫ travels slowly across the land. ♫

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.160
♫ Another child could use a hand. ♫

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
♫ Reaching out from within ♫

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:14.160
♫ tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
♫ Annihilation moves. ♫

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
♫ The earth is an open tomb. ♫

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
♫ The sound of the final boom ♫

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
♫ rumbles fiercely across the land. ♫

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
♫ Fear, you're the enemy. ♫

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
♫ Obliterating all but thee. ♫

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
♫ You see what you want to see. ♫

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
♫ Before I'm blinded, I will toast ♫

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.160
♫ the shade of power that I love most, ♫

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.160
♫ the power of creation. ♫

00:08:50.160 --> 00:09:08.160
♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.160
♫ Da, da, da, da ♫

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
♫ As a child, alone and afraid, ♫

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.160
♫ escaping the impressions every feeling made, ♫

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.160
♫ I would run, run away ♫

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.160
♫ into a world where the good was the aim of the game ♫

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.160
♫ and the sum of invisible power ♫

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
♫ had a name. ♫

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
♫ It's the same name. ♫

00:09:51.160 --> 00:10:07.160
♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160
♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.160
♫ Tembere, tembere, tembere, tembererana ♫

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.160
♫ Tembere, tembere, tembere, tembererana, hey ♫

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
♫ Tembererana, hey ♫

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
♫ Tembererana ... ♫

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.160
(Applause)
