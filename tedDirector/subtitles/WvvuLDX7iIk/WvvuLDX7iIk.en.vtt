00:00:12.827 --> 00:00:15.888
I was recently traveling
in the Highlands of New Guinea,

00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:18.406
and I was talking with a man
who had three wives.

00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:21.994
I asked him, "How many wives
would you like to have?"

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.774
And there was this long pause,

00:00:23.798 --> 00:00:24.993
and I thought to myself,

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:26.568
"Is he going to say five?

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:28.019
Is he going to say 10?

00:00:28.043 --> 00:00:29.885
Is he going to say 25?"

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.071
And he leaned towards me

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:32.605
and he whispered, "None."

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.809
(Laughter)

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:39.889
Eighty-six percent of human societies
permit a man to have several wives:

00:00:39.913 --> 00:00:41.064
polygyny.

00:00:41.088 --> 00:00:43.197
But in the vast majority
of these cultures,

00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:47.519
only about five or ten percent of men
actually do have several wives.

00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:49.890
Having several partners
can be a toothache.

00:00:49.914 --> 00:00:53.034
In fact, co-wives can
fight with each other,

00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:55.995
sometimes they can even poison
each other's children.

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:59.106
And you've got to have
a lot of cows, a lot of goats,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.095
a lot of money, a lot of land,

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:02.655
in order to build a harem.

00:01:03.017 --> 00:01:05.392
We are a pair-bonding species.

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:08.954
Ninety-seven percent of mammals
do not pair up to rear their young;

00:01:08.978 --> 00:01:10.806
human beings do.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.980
I'm not suggesting that we're not --

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.151
that we're necessarily
sexually faithful to our partners.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.923
I've looked at adultery in 42 cultures,

00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:21.382
I understand, actually,
some of the genetics of it,

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:23.254
and some of the brain circuitry of it.

00:01:23.278 --> 00:01:25.221
It's very common around the world,

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:27.182
but we are built to love.

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:31.032
How is technology changing love?

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:33.987
I'm going to say almost not at all.

00:01:34.744 --> 00:01:36.098
I study the brain.

00:01:36.122 --> 00:01:39.852
I and my colleagues have put
over 100 people into a brain scanner --

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:42.883
people who had just
fallen happily in love,

00:01:42.907 --> 00:01:44.938
people who had just been rejected in love

00:01:44.962 --> 00:01:46.835
and people who are in love long-term.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.046
And it is possible
to remain "in love" long-term.

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:52.449
And I've long ago maintained

00:01:52.473 --> 00:01:55.498
that we've evolved three distinctly
different brain systems

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:57.359
for mating and reproduction:

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:58.535
sex drive,

00:01:58.559 --> 00:02:00.495
feelings of intense romantic love

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:04.265
and feelings of deep cosmic
attachment to a long-term partner.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.725
And together, these three brain systems --

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:09.237
with many other parts of the brain --

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:14.387
orchestrate our sexual,
our romantic and our family lives.

00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:16.804
But they lie way below the cortex,

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:21.049
way below the limbic system
where we feel our emotions,

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:22.360
generate our emotions.

00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:27.199
They lie in the most primitive parts
of the brain, linked with energy,

00:02:27.223 --> 00:02:32.479
focus, craving, motivation,
wanting and drive.

00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:33.656
In this case,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.211
the drive to win life's greatest prize:

00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:37.669
a mating partner.

00:02:37.693 --> 00:02:42.210
They evolved over 4.4 million years ago
among our first ancestors,

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:46.696
and they're not going to change
if you swipe left or right on Tinder.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.267
(Laughter)

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:50.737
(Applause)

00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:55.376
There's no question that technology
is changing the way we court:

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.324
emailing, texting,

00:02:57.348 --> 00:02:59.323
emojis to express your emotions,

00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:00.611
sexting,

00:03:00.635 --> 00:03:03.071
"liking" a photograph, selfies ...

00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:07.207
We're seeing new rules
and taboos for how to court.

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:09.923
But, you know --

00:03:09.947 --> 00:03:13.091
is this actually
dramatically changing love?

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.094
What about the late 1940s,

00:03:16.118 --> 00:03:18.679
when the automobile became very popular

00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:21.049
and we suddenly had rolling bedrooms?

00:03:21.073 --> 00:03:22.791
(Laughter)

00:03:22.815 --> 00:03:27.053
How about the introduction
of the birth control pill?

00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:32.788
Unchained from the great threat
of pregnancy and social ruin,

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:37.236
women could finally express
their primitive and primal sexuality.

00:03:37.724 --> 00:03:40.741
Even dating sites are not changing love.

00:03:40.765 --> 00:03:43.323
I'm Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.com,

00:03:43.347 --> 00:03:45.027
I've been it for 11 years.

00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:47.055
I keep telling them
and they agree with me,

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.618
that these are not dating sites,

00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:50.655
they are introducing sites.

00:03:51.017 --> 00:03:53.280
When you sit down in a bar,

00:03:53.304 --> 00:03:54.888
in a coffee house,

00:03:54.912 --> 00:03:56.268
on a park bench,

00:03:56.292 --> 00:04:01.297
your ancient brain snaps into action
like a sleeping cat awakened,

00:04:01.321 --> 00:04:02.620
and you smile

00:04:02.644 --> 00:04:03.802
and laugh

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:05.008
and listen

00:04:05.032 --> 00:04:09.905
and parade the way our ancestors
did 100,000 years ago.

00:04:10.424 --> 00:04:12.377
We can give you various people --

00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:13.966
all the dating sites can --

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.903
but the only real algorithm
is your own human brain.

00:04:17.927 --> 00:04:20.499
Technology is not going to change that.

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:25.685
Technology is also not going to change
who you choose to love.

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:28.405
I study the biology of personality,

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:29.641
and I've come to believe

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:33.948
that we've evolved four very broad
styles of thinking and behaving,

00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:35.802
linked with the dopamine, serotonin,

00:04:35.826 --> 00:04:38.004
testosterone and estrogen systems.

00:04:38.358 --> 00:04:42.511
So I created a questionnaire
directly from brain science

00:04:42.535 --> 00:04:45.677
to measure the degree to which
you express the traits --

00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:47.455
the constellation of traits --

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.487
linked with each
of these four brain systems.

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:55.697
I then put that questionnaire
on various dating sites

00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:57.363
in 40 countries.

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.859
Fourteen million or more people
have now taken the questionnaire,

00:05:01.883 --> 00:05:05.808
and I've been able to watch
who's naturally drawn to whom.

00:05:06.462 --> 00:05:07.973
And as it turns out,

00:05:07.997 --> 00:05:10.566
those who were very expressive
of the dopamine system

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.725
tend to be curious, creative,
spontaneous, energetic --

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:17.200
I would imagine there's an awful lot
of people like that in this room --

00:05:17.224 --> 00:05:19.152
they're drawn to people like themselves.

00:05:19.176 --> 00:05:22.559
Curious, creative people
need people like themselves.

00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:25.221
People who are very expressive
of the serotonin system

00:05:25.245 --> 00:05:28.124
tend to be traditional, conventional,
they follow the rules,

00:05:28.148 --> 00:05:30.026
they respect authority,

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.436
they tend to be religious -- religiosity
is in the serotonin system --

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.797
and traditional people
go for traditional people.

00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.485
In that way, similarity attracts.

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.731
In the other two cases, opposites attract.

00:05:41.755 --> 00:05:44.052
People very expressive
of the testosterone system

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:47.999
tend to be analytical,
logical, direct, decisive,

00:05:48.023 --> 00:05:49.505
and they go for their opposite:

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:51.782
they go for somebody who's high estrogen,

00:05:51.806 --> 00:05:54.048
somebody who's got very good verbal skills

00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:55.314
and people skills,

00:05:55.338 --> 00:05:56.786
who's very intuitive

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.123
and who's very nurturing
and emotionally expressive.

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:03.091
We have natural patterns of mate choice.

00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:08.524
Modern technology is not going
to change who we choose to love.

00:06:09.488 --> 00:06:12.041
But technology is producing
one modern trend

00:06:12.065 --> 00:06:13.801
that I find particularly important.

00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.839
It's associated with the concept
of paradox of choice.

00:06:18.372 --> 00:06:19.826
For millions of years,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.117
we lived in little hunting
and gathering groups.

00:06:22.141 --> 00:06:24.667
You didn't have the opportunity to choose

00:06:24.691 --> 00:06:27.801
between 1,000 people on a dating site.

00:06:28.261 --> 00:06:30.318
In fact, I've been studying this recently,

00:06:30.342 --> 00:06:33.497
and I actually think there's some
sort of sweet spot in the brain;

00:06:33.521 --> 00:06:37.472
I don't know what it is, but apparently,
from reading a lot of the data,

00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:42.647
we can embrace about five
to nine alternatives, and after that,

00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:45.891
you get into what academics
call "cognitive overload,"

00:06:45.915 --> 00:06:47.716
and you don't choose any.

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:51.321
So I've come to think that due
to this cognitive overload,

00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:54.656
we're ushering in a new form of courtship

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.625
that I call "slow love."

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:00.766
I arrived at this during
my work with Match.com.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.081
Every year for the last six years,

00:07:03.105 --> 00:07:05.798
we've done a study called
"Singles in America."

00:07:05.822 --> 00:07:07.630
We don't poll the Match population,

00:07:07.654 --> 00:07:09.614
we poll the American population.

00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:12.607
We use 5,000-plus people,

00:07:12.631 --> 00:07:16.528
a representative sample of Americans
based on the US census.

00:07:16.552 --> 00:07:19.444
We've got data now on over 30,000 people,

00:07:19.468 --> 00:07:21.935
and every single year,

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:24.485
I see some of the same patterns.

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:27.288
Every single year when I ask the question,

00:07:27.312 --> 00:07:30.075
over 50 percent of people
have had a one-night stand --

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:32.766
not necessarily last year,
but in their lives --

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.063
50 percent have had
a friends with benefits

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:36.694
during the course of their lives,

00:07:36.718 --> 00:07:40.286
and over 50 percent have lived
with a person long-term

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.746
before marrying.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.972
Americans think that this is reckless.

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:46.915
I have doubted that for a long time;

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:48.831
the patterns are too strong.

00:07:48.855 --> 00:07:51.583
There's got to be some
Darwinian explanation --

00:07:51.607 --> 00:07:53.933
Not that many people are crazy.

00:07:53.957 --> 00:07:57.845
And I stumbled, then, on a statistic
that really came home to me.

00:07:58.267 --> 00:08:00.866
It was a very interesting academic article

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.903
in which I found that 67 percent
of singles in America today

00:08:05.927 --> 00:08:08.341
who are living long-term with somebody,

00:08:08.365 --> 00:08:12.452
have not yet married because
they are terrified of divorce.

00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:14.332
They're terrified of the social,

00:08:14.356 --> 00:08:15.889
legal, emotional,

00:08:15.913 --> 00:08:18.782
economic consequences of divorce.

00:08:18.806 --> 00:08:22.564
So I came to realize that I don't think
this is recklessness;

00:08:22.588 --> 00:08:24.264
I think it's caution.

00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:29.813
Today's singles want to know
every single thing about a partner

00:08:29.837 --> 00:08:31.466
before they wed.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.419
You learn a lot between the sheets,

00:08:33.443 --> 00:08:35.955
not only about how somebody makes love,

00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:37.349
but whether they're kind,

00:08:37.373 --> 00:08:38.715
whether they can listen

00:08:38.739 --> 00:08:39.911
and at my age,

00:08:39.935 --> 00:08:41.713
whether they've got a sense of humor.

00:08:41.737 --> 00:08:43.140
(Laughter)

00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:46.618
And in an age where we have
too many choices,

00:08:47.075 --> 00:08:50.337
we have very little fear
of pregnancy and disease

00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:54.069
and we've got no feeling of shame
for sex before marriage,

00:08:54.093 --> 00:08:57.791
I think people are taking
their time to love.

00:08:58.408 --> 00:09:00.059
And actually, what's happening is,

00:09:00.083 --> 00:09:03.944
what we're seeing is a real expansion
of the precommitment stage

00:09:03.968 --> 00:09:05.704
before you tie the knot.

00:09:06.034 --> 00:09:08.760
Where marriage used to be
the beginning of a relationship,

00:09:08.784 --> 00:09:10.453
now it's the finale.

00:09:11.413 --> 00:09:13.153
But the human brain --

00:09:13.177 --> 00:09:15.186
(Laughter)

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.024
The human brain always triumphs,

00:09:17.048 --> 00:09:18.943
and indeed, in the United States today,

00:09:18.967 --> 00:09:22.465
86 percent of Americans
will marry by age 49.

00:09:22.489 --> 00:09:26.035
And even in cultures around the world
where they're not marrying as often,

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:29.334
they are settling down eventually
with a long-term partner.

00:09:29.358 --> 00:09:31.193
So it began to occur to me:

00:09:31.217 --> 00:09:35.784
during this long extension
of the precommitment stage,

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:38.981
if you can get rid of bad
relationships before you marry,

00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:41.452
maybe we're going to see
more happy marriages.

00:09:41.838 --> 00:09:46.713
So I did a study of 1,100
married people in America --

00:09:46.737 --> 00:09:48.464
not on Match.com, of course --

00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:50.604
and I asked them a lot of questions.

00:09:50.628 --> 00:09:52.135
But one of the questions was,

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:56.731
"Would you re-marry the person
you're currently married to?"

00:09:56.755 --> 00:09:59.620
And 81 percent said, "Yes."

00:10:00.613 --> 00:10:07.092
In fact, the greatest change
in modern romance and family life

00:10:07.116 --> 00:10:08.516
is not technology.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.564
It's not even slow love.

00:10:11.047 --> 00:10:13.998
It's actually women
piling into the job market

00:10:14.022 --> 00:10:15.445
in cultures around the world.

00:10:15.767 --> 00:10:16.996
For millions of years,

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.990
our ancestors lived
in little hunting and gathering groups.

00:10:20.014 --> 00:10:22.919
Women commuted to work
to gather their fruits and vegetables.

00:10:22.943 --> 00:10:26.453
They came home with 60 to 80
percent of the evening meal.

00:10:26.477 --> 00:10:29.170
The double-income family was the rule.

00:10:29.194 --> 00:10:33.135
And women were regarded
as just as economically, socially

00:10:33.159 --> 00:10:36.274
and sexually powerful as men.

00:10:36.298 --> 00:10:39.400
Then the environment changed
some 10,000 years ago,

00:10:39.424 --> 00:10:41.653
we began to settle down on the farm

00:10:41.677 --> 00:10:44.868
and both men and women
became obliged, really,

00:10:44.892 --> 00:10:46.464
to marry the right person,

00:10:46.488 --> 00:10:47.918
from the right background,

00:10:47.942 --> 00:10:49.245
from the right religion

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:52.807
and from the right kin
and social and political connections.

00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:54.425
Men's jobs became more important:

00:10:54.449 --> 00:10:57.186
they had to move the rocks,
fell the trees, plow the land.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.134
They brought the produce
to local markets, and came home

00:11:00.158 --> 00:11:01.672
with the equivalent of money.

00:11:01.696 --> 00:11:03.242
Along with this,

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:06.243
we see a rise of a host of beliefs:

00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:08.449
the belief of virginity at marriage,

00:11:08.473 --> 00:11:11.416
arranged marriages --
strictly arranged marriages --

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.967
the belief that the man
is the head of the household,

00:11:13.991 --> 00:11:16.230
that the wife's place is in the home

00:11:16.254 --> 00:11:17.407
and most important,

00:11:17.431 --> 00:11:20.562
honor thy husband,
and 'til death do us part.

00:11:20.586 --> 00:11:22.308
These are gone.

00:11:22.332 --> 00:11:24.881
They are going, and in many places,

00:11:24.905 --> 00:11:26.293
they are gone.

00:11:26.317 --> 00:11:29.740
We are right now in a marriage revolution.

00:11:29.764 --> 00:11:34.479
We are shedding 10,000 years
of our farming tradition

00:11:34.503 --> 00:11:40.129
and moving forward towards egalitarian
relationships between the sexes --

00:11:40.153 --> 00:11:44.968
something I regard as highly compatible
with the ancient human spirit.

00:11:45.562 --> 00:11:47.264
I'm not a Pollyanna;

00:11:47.288 --> 00:11:49.049
there's a great deal to cry about.

00:11:49.073 --> 00:11:50.819
I've studied divorce in 80 cultures,

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:52.979
I've studied, as I say,
adultery in many --

00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:54.819
there's a whole pile of problems.

00:11:54.843 --> 00:11:58.035
As William Butler Yeats,
the poet, once said,

00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:00.524
"Love is the crooked thing."

00:12:01.131 --> 00:12:03.921
I would add, "Nobody gets out alive."

00:12:03.945 --> 00:12:05.040
(Laughter)

00:12:05.064 --> 00:12:06.531
We all have problems.

00:12:06.925 --> 00:12:10.529
But in fact, I think the poet
Randall Jarrell really sums it up best.

00:12:10.553 --> 00:12:15.552
He said, "The dark, uneasy world
of family life --

00:12:15.576 --> 00:12:20.094
where the greatest can fail,
and the humblest succeed."

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:22.666
But I will leave you with this:

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.418
love and attachment will prevail,

00:12:25.442 --> 00:12:27.975
technology cannot change it.

00:12:27.999 --> 00:12:29.837
And I will conclude by saying

00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:35.107
any understanding of human relationships
must take into account

00:12:35.131 --> 00:12:39.356
one the most powerful determinants
of human behavior:

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.598
the unquenchable,

00:12:41.217 --> 00:12:42.382
adaptable

00:12:42.789 --> 00:12:45.795
and primordial human drive to love.

00:12:45.819 --> 00:12:46.971
Thank you.

00:12:46.995 --> 00:12:50.017
(Applause)

00:12:51.915 --> 00:12:54.296
Kelly Stoetzel: Thank you
so much for that, Helen.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.629
As you know, there's another
speaker here with us

00:12:56.653 --> 00:12:58.203
that works in your same field.

00:12:58.227 --> 00:13:00.658
She comes at it
from a different perspective.

00:13:00.682 --> 00:13:05.319
Esther Perel is a psychotherapist
who works with couples.

00:13:05.749 --> 00:13:07.042
You study data,

00:13:07.066 --> 00:13:09.566
Esther studies the stories
the couples tell her

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.618
when they come to her for help.

00:13:11.642 --> 00:13:13.366
Let's have her join us on the stage.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.541
Esther?

00:13:14.565 --> 00:13:17.696
(Applause)

00:13:22.249 --> 00:13:23.495
So Esther,

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:25.791
when you were watching Helen's talk,

00:13:25.815 --> 00:13:27.021
was there any part of it

00:13:27.045 --> 00:13:29.812
that resonated with you
through the lens of your own work

00:13:29.836 --> 00:13:31.421
that you'd like to comment on?

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:35.641
Esther Perel: It's interesting,
because on the one hand,

00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:39.494
the need for love
is ubiquitous and universal.

00:13:39.965 --> 00:13:41.929
But the way we love --

00:13:41.953 --> 00:13:43.483
the meaning we make out of it --

00:13:43.507 --> 00:13:45.832
the rules that govern
our relationships, I think,

00:13:45.856 --> 00:13:47.883
are changing fundamentally.

00:13:47.907 --> 00:13:50.807
We come from a model that, until now,

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:54.294
was primarily regulated
around duty and obligation,

00:13:54.318 --> 00:13:56.715
the needs of the collective and loyalty.

00:13:56.739 --> 00:13:57.919
And we have shifted it

00:13:57.943 --> 00:14:02.273
to a model of free choice
and individual rights,

00:14:02.297 --> 00:14:05.373
and self-fulfillment and happiness.

00:14:05.397 --> 00:14:07.717
And so, that was
the first thing I thought,

00:14:07.741 --> 00:14:09.509
that the need doesn't change,

00:14:09.533 --> 00:14:13.341
but the context and the way
we regulate these relationships

00:14:13.365 --> 00:14:14.643
changes a lot.

00:14:14.667 --> 00:14:16.507
On the paradox of choice --

00:14:18.682 --> 00:14:21.009
you know, on the one hand
we relish the novelty

00:14:21.033 --> 00:14:22.625
and the playfulness, I think,

00:14:22.649 --> 00:14:25.360
to be able to have so many options.

00:14:25.384 --> 00:14:26.745
And at the same time,

00:14:26.769 --> 00:14:29.183
as you talk about this cognitive overload,

00:14:29.207 --> 00:14:32.655
I see many, many people who ...

00:14:34.391 --> 00:14:38.497
who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt

00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:41.070
that comes with this massa of choice,

00:14:41.094 --> 00:14:43.353
creating a case of "FOMO"

00:14:43.377 --> 00:14:45.019
and then leading us --

00:14:45.043 --> 00:14:48.358
FOMO, fear of missed opportunity,
or fear of missing out --

00:14:48.382 --> 00:14:51.340
it's like, "How do I know
I have found 'the one' --

00:14:51.364 --> 00:14:52.536
the right one?"

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.243
So we've created what I call
this thing of "stable ambiguity."

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.305
Stable ambiguity is when
you are too afraid to be alone

00:15:00.329 --> 00:15:04.364
but also not really willing
to engage in intimacy-building.

00:15:04.388 --> 00:15:09.682
It's a set of tactics that kind of prolong
the uncertainty of a relationship

00:15:09.706 --> 00:15:12.313
but also the uncertainty of the breakup.

00:15:12.337 --> 00:15:15.319
So, here on the internet
you have three major ones.

00:15:15.343 --> 00:15:17.664
One is icing and simmering,

00:15:17.688 --> 00:15:20.563
which are great stalling tactics

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:23.064
that offer a kind of holding pattern

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:26.882
that emphasizes the undefined
nature of a relationship

00:15:26.906 --> 00:15:31.013
but at the same time gives you
enough of a comforting consistency

00:15:31.037 --> 00:15:33.794
and enough freedom
of the undefined boundaries.

00:15:33.818 --> 00:15:35.644
(Laughter)

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:37.240
Yeah?

00:15:37.264 --> 00:15:38.812
And then comes ghosting.

00:15:38.836 --> 00:15:40.808
And ghosting is, basically,

00:15:40.832 --> 00:15:45.352
you disappear from this massa
of texts on the spot,

00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:49.161
and you don't have to deal with
the pain that you inflict on another,

00:15:49.185 --> 00:15:51.783
because you're making it
invisible even to yourself.

00:15:51.807 --> 00:15:52.994
(Laughter)

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:54.176
Yeah?

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.937
So I was thinking -- these words came up
for me as I was listening to you,

00:15:58.961 --> 00:16:04.124
like how a vocabulary
also creates a reality,

00:16:04.148 --> 00:16:05.703
and at the same time,

00:16:05.727 --> 00:16:07.411
that's my question to you:

00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:10.375
Do you think when the context changes,

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:14.039
it still means that the nature
of love remains the same?

00:16:14.063 --> 00:16:18.161
You study the brain and I study
people's relationships and stories,

00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:22.171
so I think it's everything you say, plus.

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:26.593
But I don't always know the degree
to which a changing context ...

00:16:27.451 --> 00:16:29.981
Does it at some point begin to change --

00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:32.618
If the meaning changes,
does it change the need,

00:16:32.642 --> 00:16:35.105
or is the need clear
of the entire context?

00:16:35.797 --> 00:16:37.217
HF: Wow! Well --

00:16:37.241 --> 00:16:39.672
(Laughter)

00:16:39.696 --> 00:16:42.871
(Applause)

00:16:42.895 --> 00:16:45.863
Well, I've got three points here, right?

00:16:46.736 --> 00:16:48.562
First of all, to your first one:

00:16:48.586 --> 00:16:52.179
there's no question that we've changed,
that we now want a person to love,

00:16:52.203 --> 00:16:55.048
and for thousands of years,
we had to marry the right person

00:16:55.072 --> 00:16:57.463
from the right background
and right kin connection.

00:16:57.497 --> 00:17:00.718
And in fact, in my studies
of 5,000 people every year,

00:17:00.742 --> 00:17:02.868
I ask them, "What are you looking for?"

00:17:02.892 --> 00:17:05.650
And every single year,
over 97 percent say --

00:17:05.674 --> 00:17:06.884
EP: The list grows --

00:17:06.908 --> 00:17:08.068
HF: Well, no.

00:17:08.092 --> 00:17:11.415
The basic thing is
over 97 percent of people

00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:13.530
want somebody that respects them,

00:17:13.554 --> 00:17:15.842
somebody they can trust and confide in,

00:17:15.866 --> 00:17:17.522
somebody who makes them laugh,

00:17:17.546 --> 00:17:19.428
somebody who makes enough time for them

00:17:19.452 --> 00:17:23.449
and somebody who they find
physically attractive.

00:17:23.473 --> 00:17:24.756
That never changes.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.958
And there's certainly -- you know,
there's two parts --

00:17:27.982 --> 00:17:29.562
EP: But you know how I call that?

00:17:29.586 --> 00:17:31.836
That's not what people used to say --

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.090
HF: That's exactly right.

00:17:33.114 --> 00:17:36.413
EP: They said they wanted somebody
with whom they have companionship,

00:17:36.437 --> 00:17:37.728
economic support, children.

00:17:37.752 --> 00:17:40.338
We went from a production economy
to a service economy.

00:17:40.362 --> 00:17:41.371
(Laughter)

00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:44.376
We did it in the larger culture,
and we're doing it in marriage.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.948
HF: Right, no question about it.

00:17:45.972 --> 00:17:49.882
But it's interesting, the millennials
actually want to be very good parents,

00:17:49.906 --> 00:17:54.026
whereas the generation above them
wants to have a very fine marriage

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.272
but is not as focused
on being a good parent.

00:17:56.296 --> 00:17:58.379
You see all of these nuances.

00:17:58.403 --> 00:18:00.959
There's two basic parts of personality:

00:18:00.983 --> 00:18:04.558
there's your culture -- everything you
grew up to do and believe and say --

00:18:04.582 --> 00:18:05.981
and there's your temperament.

00:18:06.005 --> 00:18:08.832
Basically, what I've been talking
about is your temperament.

00:18:08.856 --> 00:18:12.174
And that temperament is certainly
going to change with changing times

00:18:12.198 --> 00:18:13.499
and changing beliefs.

00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:17.038
And in terms of the paradox of choice,

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:19.469
there's no question about it
that this is a pickle.

00:18:19.493 --> 00:18:22.357
There were millions of years
where you found that sweet boy

00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:24.106
at the other side of the water hole,

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.281
and you went for it.

00:18:25.305 --> 00:18:26.456
EP: Yes, but you --

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.227
HF: I do want to say one more thing.

00:18:28.251 --> 00:18:30.868
The bottom line is, in hunting
and gathering societies,

00:18:30.892 --> 00:18:34.490
they tended to have two or three partners
during the course of their lives.

00:18:34.514 --> 00:18:35.672
They weren't square!

00:18:35.696 --> 00:18:37.352
And I'm not suggesting that we do,

00:18:37.376 --> 00:18:41.352
but the bottom line is,
we've always had alternatives.

00:18:41.376 --> 00:18:42.855
Mankind is always --

00:18:42.879 --> 00:18:46.071
in fact, the brain is well-built
to what we call "equilibrate,"

00:18:46.095 --> 00:18:47.246
to try and decide:

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.704
Do I come, do I stay? Do I go, do I stay?

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:51.276
What are the opportunities here?

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.602
How do I handle this there?

00:18:52.626 --> 00:18:55.587
And so I think we're seeing
another play-out of that now.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.675
KS: Well, thank you both so much.

00:18:57.699 --> 00:19:00.905
I think you're going to have
a million dinner partners for tonight!

00:19:00.929 --> 00:19:02.908
(Applause)

00:19:02.932 --> 00:19:04.113
Thank you, thank you.
