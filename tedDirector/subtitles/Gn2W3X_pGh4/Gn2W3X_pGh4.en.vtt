00:00:15.702 --> 00:00:19.602
Twelve years ago, I was in the street writing my name

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.441
to say, "I exist."

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:26.434
Then I went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street

00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:28.791
to say, "They exist."

00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:33.306
From the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine,

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:35.716
the rooftops of Kenya

00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:37.604
to the favelas of Rio,

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:41.347
paper and glue -- as easy as that.

00:00:41.347 --> 00:00:43.566
I asked a question last year:

00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.841
Can art change the world?

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:47.843
Well let me tell you,

00:00:47.843 --> 00:00:51.583
in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year,

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:54.777
because the Arab Spring is still spreading,

00:00:54.777 --> 00:00:58.087
the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else?

00:00:58.087 --> 00:01:01.080
The Occupy movement found a voice,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.552
and I still have to speak English constantly.

00:01:03.552 --> 00:01:06.385
So there has been a lot of change.

00:01:06.385 --> 00:01:08.520
So when I had my TED wish last year,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.683
I said, look, I'm going to switch my concept.

00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:14.351
You are going to take the photos.

00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:16.931
You're going to send them to me.

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:20.148
I'm going to print them and send them back to you.

00:01:20.148 --> 00:01:22.630
Then you're going to paste them where it makes sense

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:24.520
for you to place your own statement.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.989
This is Inside Out.

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:31.156
One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year.

00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:35.172
Those are the kind of posters, let me show you.

00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:37.427
And we keep sending more every day.

00:01:37.427 --> 00:01:38.871
This is the size.

00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:42.777
Just a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it.

00:01:42.793 --> 00:01:46.308
This one was from Haiti.

00:01:46.308 --> 00:01:48.760
When I launched my wish last year,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.185
hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us.

00:01:53.185 --> 00:01:55.402
But I say it has to be

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:58.856
under the conditions I've always worked:

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:03.118
no credit, no logos, no sponsoring.

00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:07.468
A week later, a handful of people were there ready to rock

00:02:07.468 --> 00:02:09.922
and empower the people on the ground

00:02:09.922 --> 00:02:11.468
who wanted to change the world.

00:02:11.468 --> 00:02:16.280
These are the people I want to talk about to you today.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.054
Two weeks after my speech, in Tunisia,

00:02:22.054 --> 00:02:25.805
hundreds of portraits were made.

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:30.052
And they pasted [over] every single portrait of the dictator

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:31.552
[with] their own photos.

00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:34.385
Boom! This is what happened.

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:36.135
Slim and his friends went through the country

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:38.510
and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.673
to show the diversity in the country.

00:02:41.673 --> 00:02:45.756
They really make Inside Out their own project.

00:02:45.756 --> 00:02:49.302
Actually, that photo was pasted in a police station,

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:50.806
and what you see on the ground

00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:56.967
are ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police.

00:02:56.967 --> 00:03:01.677
Russia. Chad wanted to fight against homophobia in Russia.

00:03:01.677 --> 00:03:06.200
He went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.260
and stood there with the photos

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.020
to say, "We have rights."

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.551
They used Inside Out as a platform for protest.

00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:16.468
Karachi, Pakistan.

00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:18.268
Sharmeen is actually here.

00:03:18.268 --> 00:03:21.633
She organized a TEDx action out there

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:24.664
and made all the unseen faces of the city

00:03:24.664 --> 00:03:26.927
on the walls in her town.

00:03:26.927 --> 00:03:29.258
And I want to thank her today.

00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:33.033
North Dakota. Standing Rock Nation,

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:38.768
in this Turtle Island, [unclear name] from the Dakota Lakota tribe

00:03:38.768 --> 00:03:42.125
wanted to show that the Native Americans are still here.

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:45.760
The seventh generation are still fighting for their rights.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.735
He pasted up portraits all over his reservation.

00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:50.602
And he's here also today.

00:03:50.602 --> 00:03:54.102
Each time I get a wall in New York,

00:03:54.102 --> 00:03:59.123
I use his photos to continue spreading the project.

00:03:59.123 --> 00:04:02.177
Juarez: You've heard of the border --

00:04:02.177 --> 00:04:05.010
one of the most dangerous borders in the world.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.783
Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:12.568
and covered the entire border.

00:04:12.568 --> 00:04:14.593
Do you know what it takes to do this?

00:04:14.593 --> 00:04:18.695
People, energy, make the glue, organize the team.

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:20.814
It was amazing.

00:04:20.814 --> 00:04:23.614
While in Iran at the same time

00:04:23.614 --> 00:04:25.977
Abololo -- of course a nickname --

00:04:25.977 --> 00:04:28.922
has pasted one single face of a woman

00:04:28.922 --> 00:04:32.521
to show his resistance against the government.

00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:37.231
I don't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action.

00:04:37.231 --> 00:04:39.833
There are tons of school projects.

00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:43.483
Twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools.

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:45.383
Education is so essential.

00:04:45.383 --> 00:04:48.718
Kids just make photos in a class, the teacher receives them,

00:04:48.718 --> 00:04:50.393
they paste them on the school.

00:04:50.393 --> 00:04:52.385
Here they even got the help of the firemen.

00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:56.160
There should be even more schools doing this kind of project.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.995
Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine.

00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:05.030
So we went there with a truck. This is a photobooth truck.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.241
You go on the back of that truck, it takes your photo,

00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:11.364
30 seconds later take it from the side, you're ready to rock.

00:05:11.364 --> 00:05:14.326
Thousands of people use them

00:05:14.326 --> 00:05:18.497
and each of them signs up for a two-state peace solution

00:05:18.497 --> 00:05:20.427
and then walk in the street.

00:05:20.427 --> 00:05:24.504
This is march, the 450,000 march -- beginning of September.

00:05:24.504 --> 00:05:26.814
They were all holding their photo as a statement.

00:05:26.814 --> 00:05:30.843
On the other side, people were wrapping up streets, buildings.

00:05:30.843 --> 00:05:32.345
It's everywhere.

00:05:32.345 --> 00:05:35.364
Come on, don't tell me that people aren't ready for peace out there.

00:05:35.364 --> 00:05:40.052
These projects took thousands of actions in one year,

00:05:40.052 --> 00:05:43.218
making hundreds of thousands of people participating,

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:46.893
creating millions of views.

00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:53.998
This is the biggest global art participatory project that's going on.

00:05:53.998 --> 00:05:57.860
So back to the question, "Can art change the world?"

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.716
Maybe not in one year. That's the beginning.

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:04.446
But maybe we should change the question.

00:06:04.446 --> 00:06:06.985
Can art change people's lives?

00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:10.860
From what I've seen this year, yes.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.543
And you know what? It's just the beginning.

00:06:13.543 --> 00:06:16.316
Let's turn the world inside out together.

00:06:16.331 --> 00:06:17.724
Thank you.

00:06:17.724 --> 00:06:23.498
(Applause)
