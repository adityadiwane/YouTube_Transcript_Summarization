00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.173
So, how many of you have ever

00:00:17.173 --> 00:00:18.828
gotten behind the wheel of a car

00:00:18.828 --> 00:00:24.515
when you really shouldn't have been driving?

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:26.420
Maybe you're out on the road for a long day,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.910
and you just wanted to get home.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.557
You were tired, but you felt you could drive a few more miles.

00:00:30.557 --> 00:00:31.756
Maybe you thought,

00:00:31.756 --> 00:00:33.773
I've had less to drink than everybody else,

00:00:33.773 --> 00:00:35.509
I should be the one to go home.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:40.100
Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.554
Does this sound familiar to you?

00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:44.452
Now, in those situations, wouldn't it be great

00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:46.045
if there was a button on your dashboard

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:52.388
that you could push, and the car would get you home safely?

00:00:52.388 --> 00:00:54.681
Now, that's been the promise of the self-driving car,

00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:57.308
the autonomous vehicle, and it's been the dream

00:00:57.308 --> 00:01:00.557
since at least 1939, when General Motors showcased

00:01:00.557 --> 00:01:03.859
this idea at their Futurama booth at the World's Fair.

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.802
Now, it's been one of those dreams

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:10.016
that's always seemed about 20 years in the future.

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:12.699
Now, two weeks ago, that dream took a step forward,

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:15.964
when the state of Nevada granted Google's self-driving car

00:01:15.964 --> 00:01:19.564
the very first license for an autonomous vehicle,

00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:21.809
clearly establishing that it's legal for them

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:23.619
to test it on the roads in Nevada.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.346
Now, California's considering similar legislation,

00:01:27.346 --> 00:01:29.754
and this would make sure that the autonomous car

00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:32.731
is not one of those things that has to stay in Vegas.

00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:34.827
(Laughter)

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:38.611
Now, in my lab at Stanford, we've been working on

00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:42.098
autonomous cars too, but with a slightly different spin

00:01:42.098 --> 00:01:46.346
on things. You see, we've been developing robotic race cars,

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:50.466
cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits

00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:52.706
of physical performance.

00:01:52.706 --> 00:01:55.319
Now, why would we want to do such a thing?

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.419
Well, there's two really good reasons for this.

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:01.378
First, we believe that before people turn over control

00:02:01.378 --> 00:02:04.212
to an autonomous car, that autonomous car should be

00:02:04.212 --> 00:02:07.466
at least as good as the very best human drivers.

00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:10.771
Now, if you're like me, and the other 70 percent of the population

00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:12.964
who know that we are above-average drivers,

00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:16.139
you understand that's a very high bar.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.531
There's another reason as well.

00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:22.107
Just like race car drivers can use all of the friction

00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:23.387
between the tire and the road,

00:02:23.387 --> 00:02:26.564
all of the car's capabilities to go as fast as possible,

00:02:26.564 --> 00:02:29.909
we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.497
any accident we can.

00:02:31.497 --> 00:02:33.547
Now, you may push the car to the limits

00:02:33.547 --> 00:02:35.514
not because you're driving too fast,

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:37.674
but because you've hit an icy patch of road,

00:02:37.674 --> 00:02:39.378
conditions have changed.

00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:42.139
In those situations, we want a car

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.859
that is capable enough to avoid any accident

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.537
that can physically be avoided.

00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:52.804
I must confess, there's kind of a third motivation as well.

00:02:52.804 --> 00:02:55.060
You see, I have a passion for racing.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.824
In the past, I've been a race car owner,

00:02:57.824 --> 00:03:00.379
a crew chief and a driving coach,

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.234
although maybe not at the level that you're currently expecting.

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:06.938
One of the things that we've developed in the lab --

00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:08.642
we've developed several vehicles --

00:03:08.642 --> 00:03:10.877
is what we believe is the world's first

00:03:10.877 --> 00:03:13.242
autonomously drifting car.

00:03:13.242 --> 00:03:15.755
It's another one of those categories

00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:18.178
where maybe there's not a lot of competition.

00:03:18.178 --> 00:03:19.586
(Laughter)

00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:23.408
But this is P1. It's an entirely student-built electric vehicle,

00:03:23.408 --> 00:03:25.486
which through using its rear-wheel drive

00:03:25.486 --> 00:03:27.051
and front-wheel steer-by-wire

00:03:27.051 --> 00:03:29.118
can drift around corners.

00:03:29.118 --> 00:03:31.318
It can get sideways like a rally car driver,

00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:33.033
always able to take the tightest curve,

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:36.337
even on slippery, changing surfaces,

00:03:36.337 --> 00:03:37.953
never spinning out.

00:03:37.953 --> 00:03:40.321
We've also worked with Volkswagen Oracle,

00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:43.745
on Shelley, an autonomous race car that has raced

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:46.815
at 150 miles an hour through the Bonneville Salt Flats,

00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:51.286
gone around Thunderhill Raceway Park in the sun,

00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:53.925
the wind and the rain,

00:03:53.925 --> 00:03:58.943
and navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles

00:03:58.943 --> 00:04:00.505
of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb route

00:04:00.505 --> 00:04:03.978
in Colorado with nobody at the wheel.

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:05.426
(Laughter)

00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:10.992
(Applause)

00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:14.271
I guess it goes without saying that we've had a lot of fun

00:04:14.271 --> 00:04:15.575
doing this.

00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:19.232
But in fact, there's something else that we've developed

00:04:19.232 --> 00:04:22.287
in the process of developing these autonomous cars.

00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:26.158
We have developed a tremendous appreciation

00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:29.975
for the capabilities of human race car drivers.

00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:34.320
As we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.599
we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts.

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:43.279
And we discovered their human counterparts are amazing.

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:47.302
Now, we can take a map of a race track,

00:04:47.302 --> 00:04:49.672
we can take a mathematical model of a car,

00:04:49.672 --> 00:04:52.575
and with some iteration, we can actually find

00:04:52.575 --> 00:04:54.200
the fastest way around that track.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.733
We line that up with data that we record

00:04:56.733 --> 00:04:58.166
from a professional driver,

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:02.273
and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable.

00:05:02.273 --> 00:05:05.485
Yes, there are subtle differences here,

00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:08.612
but the human race car driver is able to go out

00:05:08.612 --> 00:05:10.947
and drive an amazingly fast line,

00:05:10.947 --> 00:05:13.277
without the benefit of an algorithm that compares

00:05:13.277 --> 00:05:15.885
the trade-off between going as fast as possible

00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:17.922
in this corner, and shaving a little bit of time

00:05:17.922 --> 00:05:19.824
off of the straight over here.

00:05:19.824 --> 00:05:23.281
Not only that, they're able to do it lap

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:25.656
after lap after lap.

00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:28.568
They're able to go out and consistently do this,

00:05:28.568 --> 00:05:32.696
pushing the car to the limits every single time.

00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:35.865
It's extraordinary to watch.

00:05:35.865 --> 00:05:37.931
You put them in a new car,

00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:41.833
and after a few laps, they've found the fastest line in that car,

00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:45.710
and they're off to the races.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.856
It really makes you think,

00:05:46.856 --> 00:05:51.727
we'd love to know what's going on inside their brain.

00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:56.268
So as researchers, that's what we decided to find out.

00:05:56.268 --> 00:05:58.080
We decided to instrument not only the car,

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.575
but also the race car driver,

00:06:00.575 --> 00:06:03.344
to try to get a glimpse into what was going on

00:06:03.344 --> 00:06:05.530
in their head as they were doing this.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.480
Now, this is Dr. Lene Harbott applying electrodes

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.712
to the head of John Morton.

00:06:10.712 --> 00:06:13.701
John Morton is a former Can-Am and IMSA driver,

00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:15.501
who's also a class champion at Le Mans.

00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:18.997
Fantastic driver, and very willing to put up with graduate students

00:06:18.997 --> 00:06:20.852
and this sort of research.

00:06:20.852 --> 00:06:23.524
She's putting electrodes on his head

00:06:23.524 --> 00:06:25.636
so that we can monitor the electrical activity

00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:28.468
in John's brain as he races around the track.

00:06:28.468 --> 00:06:31.663
Now, clearly we're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head

00:06:31.663 --> 00:06:34.933
and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track.

00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:38.340
However, neuroscientists have identified certain patterns

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.101
that let us tease out some very important aspects of this.

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:43.948
For instance, the resting brain

00:06:43.948 --> 00:06:46.103
tends to generate a lot of alpha waves.

00:06:46.103 --> 00:06:49.855
In contrast, theta waves are associated with

00:06:49.855 --> 00:06:53.039
a lot of cognitive activity, like visual processing,

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.087
things where the driver is thinking quite a bit.

00:06:56.087 --> 00:06:57.750
Now, we can measure this,

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.735
and we can look at the relative power

00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:01.935
between the theta waves and the alpha waves.

00:07:01.935 --> 00:07:04.377
This gives us a measure of mental workload,

00:07:04.377 --> 00:07:07.944
how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively

00:07:07.944 --> 00:07:09.730
at any point along the track.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.672
Now, we wanted to see if we could actually record this

00:07:12.672 --> 00:07:15.710
on the track, so we headed down south to Laguna Seca.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.726
Laguna Seca is a legendary raceway

00:07:17.726 --> 00:07:20.027
about halfway between Salinas and Monterey.

00:07:20.027 --> 00:07:22.114
It has a curve there called the Corkscrew.

00:07:22.114 --> 00:07:24.831
Now, the Corkscrew is a chicane, followed by a quick

00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:27.577
right-handed turn as the road drops three stories.

00:07:27.577 --> 00:07:31.343
Now, the strategy for driving this as explained to me was,

00:07:31.343 --> 00:07:33.365
you aim for the bush in the distance,

00:07:33.365 --> 00:07:36.390
and as the road falls away, you realize it was actually the top of a tree.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.694
All right, so thanks to the Revs Program at Stanford,

00:07:39.694 --> 00:07:41.167
we were able to take John there

00:07:41.167 --> 00:07:42.131
and put him behind the wheel

00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:44.570
of a 1960 Porsche Abarth Carrera.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.268
Life is way too short for boring cars.

00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:50.027
So, here you see John on the track,

00:07:50.027 --> 00:07:52.211
he's going up the hill -- Oh! Somebody liked that --

00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:54.676
and you can see, actually, his mental workload

00:07:54.676 --> 00:07:56.829
-- measuring here in the red bar --

00:07:56.829 --> 00:07:59.172
you can see his actions as he approaches.

00:07:59.172 --> 00:08:02.402
Now watch, he has to downshift.

00:08:02.402 --> 00:08:03.163
And then he has to turn left.

00:08:03.163 --> 00:08:07.156
Look for the tree, and down.

00:08:07.156 --> 00:08:09.994
Not surprisingly, you can see this is a pretty challenging task.

00:08:09.994 --> 00:08:12.970
You can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this,

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.034
as you would expect with something that requires

00:08:15.034 --> 00:08:17.843
this level of complexity.

00:08:17.843 --> 00:08:21.259
But what's really interesting is to look at areas of the track

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:24.105
where his mental workload doesn't increase.

00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:25.600
I'm going to take you around now

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.689
to the other side of the track.

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:29.025
Turn three. And John's going to go into that corner

00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:31.576
and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out.

00:08:31.576 --> 00:08:33.593
He's going to have to correct for that with steering.

00:08:33.593 --> 00:08:35.824
So watch as John does this here.

00:08:35.824 --> 00:08:38.146
Watch the mental workload, and watch the steering.

00:08:38.146 --> 00:08:41.818
The car begins to slide out, dramatic maneuver to correct it,

00:08:41.818 --> 00:08:45.341
and no change whatsoever in the mental workload.

00:08:45.341 --> 00:08:48.173
Not a challenging task.

00:08:48.173 --> 00:08:51.373
In fact, entirely reflexive.

00:08:51.373 --> 00:08:55.016
Now, our data processing on this is still preliminary,

00:08:55.016 --> 00:08:57.688
but it really seems that these phenomenal feats

00:08:57.688 --> 00:08:59.298
that the race car drivers are performing

00:08:59.298 --> 00:09:01.208
are instinctive.

00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:04.598
They are things that they have simply learned to do.

00:09:04.598 --> 00:09:06.880
It requires very little mental workload

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.704
for them to perform these amazing feats.

00:09:09.704 --> 00:09:12.839
And their actions are fantastic.

00:09:12.839 --> 00:09:15.450
This is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.787
to catch the car in this situation.

00:09:18.787 --> 00:09:22.232
Now, this has given us tremendous insight

00:09:22.232 --> 00:09:25.354
and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles.

00:09:25.354 --> 00:09:27.282
We've started to ask the question:

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:29.535
Can we make them a little less algorithmic

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:31.984
and a little more intuitive?

00:09:31.984 --> 00:09:34.265
Can we take this reflexive action

00:09:34.265 --> 00:09:36.552
that we see from the very best race car drivers,

00:09:36.552 --> 00:09:38.201
introduce it to our cars,

00:09:38.201 --> 00:09:40.185
and maybe even into a system that could

00:09:40.185 --> 00:09:42.153
get onto your car in the future?

00:09:42.153 --> 00:09:43.764
That would take us a long step

00:09:43.764 --> 00:09:46.273
along the road to autonomous vehicles

00:09:46.273 --> 00:09:48.185
that drive as well as the best humans.

00:09:48.185 --> 00:09:51.625
But it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well.

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:54.593
Do we want something more from our car

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:56.433
than to simply be a chauffeur?

00:09:56.433 --> 00:10:00.668
Do we want our car to perhaps be a partner, a coach,

00:10:00.668 --> 00:10:03.755
someone that can use their understanding of the situation

00:10:03.755 --> 00:10:08.011
to help us reach our potential?

00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:10.284
Can, in fact, the technology not simply replace humans,

00:10:10.284 --> 00:10:14.859
but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition

00:10:14.859 --> 00:10:18.284
that we're all capable of?

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.207
So, as we move forward into this technological future,

00:10:20.207 --> 00:10:23.028
I want you to just pause and think of that for a moment.

00:10:23.028 --> 00:10:26.803
What is the ideal balance of human and machine?

00:10:26.803 --> 00:10:28.512
And as we think about that,

00:10:28.512 --> 00:10:30.243
let's take inspiration

00:10:30.243 --> 00:10:33.572
from the absolutely amazing capabilities

00:10:33.572 --> 00:10:36.388
of the human body and the human mind.

00:10:36.388 --> 00:10:38.124
Thank you.

00:10:38.124 --> 00:10:42.728
