00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
The greatest irony in global health

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
is that the poorest countries

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
carry the largest disease burden.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
If we resize the countries of the globe

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
in proportion to the subject of interest,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
we see that Sub-Saharan Africa

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
is the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
We also see that this region

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
There are very few doctors

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
that are needed to cope

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
with such epidemics.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
So what the Western countries,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
developed countries, have generously done

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
is they have proposed to provide free drugs

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
to all people in Third World countries

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
who actually can't afford these medications.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And this has already saved millions of lives,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and it has prevented entire economies

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
But there is a fundamental problem

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
that is killing the efforts

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
in fighting this disease,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
because if you keep throwing

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
drugs out at people

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
who don't have diagnostic services,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
you end up creating a problem of drug resistance.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
The problem is that,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
what begins as a tragedy in the Third World

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
could easily become a global problem.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
And the last thing we want to see

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
is drug-resistant strains of HIV

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
popping up all over the world,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
because it will make treatment more expensive

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and it could also restore

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I experienced this firsthand

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
as a high school student in Uganda.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
This was in the 90s

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
during the peak of the HIV epidemic,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And during that time, I actually lost more relatives,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
as well as the teachers who taught me,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
to HIV/AIDS.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
So this became one of the driving passions of my life,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
to help find real solutions

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
that could address these kinds of problems.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Back in the day, computers used to fill this entire room,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and people actually used to work inside the computers.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
But what electronic miniaturization has done

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
is that it has allowed people to shrink

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
technology into a cell phone.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
in the Third World countries.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
The good news is that the same technology

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
that allowed miniaturization of electronics

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
is now allowing us to miniaturize

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
biological laboratories.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
So, right now, we can actually miniaturize

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
biological and chemistry laboratories

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
onto microfluidic chips.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
I was very lucky to come

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
to the US right after high school,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
and was able to work on this technology

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and develop some devices.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
A close look at how the technology works:

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
These are channels that are about the size of a human hair --

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
so you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers and injectors --

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
onto a microfluidic system.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
So what I plan to do with this technology

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
is to actually take the current state

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
of the technology

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
and build an HIV kit

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
in a microfluidic system.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
So, with one microfluidic chip,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
which is the size of an iPhone,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
you can actually diagnose

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
100 patients at the same time.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
For each patient, we will be able to do

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
up to 100 different viral loads per patient.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
And this is only done in four hours,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
50 times faster than the current state of the art,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
than the current options.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
So this will allow us to create

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
personalized medicines in the Third World

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
at a cost that is actually achievable

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and make the world a safer place.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
I invite your interest

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
as well as your involvement

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
in driving this vision

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
to a point of practical reality.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Thank you very much.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
(Applause)
