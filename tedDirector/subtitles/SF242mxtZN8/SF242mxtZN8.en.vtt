00:00:12.822 --> 00:00:16.257
So over the long course of human history,

00:00:16.257 --> 00:00:18.749
the infectious disease that's killed more humans

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.235
than any other is malaria.

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:24.096
It's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos,

00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:26.305
and it's probably our oldest scourge.

00:00:26.305 --> 00:00:30.192
We may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes.

00:00:30.192 --> 00:00:33.794
And to this day, malaria takes a huge toll on our species.

00:00:33.794 --> 00:00:36.245
We've got 300 million cases a year

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:39.237
and over half a million deaths.

00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:42.202
Now this really makes no sense.

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:44.854
We've known how to cure malaria

00:00:44.854 --> 00:00:46.494
since the 1600s.

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:48.791
That's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru

00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:51.693
discovered the bark of the cinchona tree,

00:00:51.693 --> 00:00:53.566
and inside that bark was quinine,

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.904
still an effective cure for malaria to this day.

00:00:56.904 --> 00:00:59.805
So we've known how to cure malaria for centuries.

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:02.989
We've known how to prevent malaria since 1897.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.262
That's when the British army surgeon Ronald Ross

00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:08.620
discovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.812
not bad air or miasmas, as was previously thought.

00:01:12.812 --> 00:01:18.095
So malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve,

00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:22.025
and yet to this day, hundreds of thousands of people

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:25.500
are going to die from the bite of a mosquito.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.745
Why is that?

00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:28.275
This is a question that's

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:30.430
personally intrigued me for a long time.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.189
I grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.448
visiting my cousins in India every summer,

00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:38.636
and because I had no immunity to the local malarias,

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:42.870
I was made to sleep under this hot, sweaty mosquito net every night

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.561
while my cousins, they were allowed to sleep

00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:45.790
out on the terrace and have

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.552
this nice, cool night breeze wafting over them.

00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:52.076
And I really hated the mosquitos for that.

00:01:52.076 --> 00:01:55.444
But at the same time, I come from a Jain family,

00:01:55.444 --> 00:01:57.758
and Jainism is a religion that espouses

00:01:57.758 --> 00:02:00.896
a very extreme form of nonviolence.

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:04.224
So Jains are not supposed to eat meat.

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:06.081
We're not supposed to walk on grass,

00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:07.342
because you could, you know,

00:02:07.342 --> 00:02:09.242
inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass.

00:02:09.242 --> 00:02:12.019
We're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos.

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.735
So the fearsome power of this little insect

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.714
was apparent to me from a very young age,

00:02:17.714 --> 00:02:20.985
and it's one reason why I spent five years as a journalist

00:02:20.985 --> 00:02:23.673
trying to understand, why has malaria

00:02:23.673 --> 00:02:28.213
been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long?

00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:30.870
And I think there's three main reasons why.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.338
Those three reasons add up to the fourth reason,

00:02:33.338 --> 00:02:36.149
which is probably the biggest reason of all.

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:39.110
The first reason is certainly scientific.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.425
This little parasite that causes malaria,

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:43.352
it's probably one of the most complex

00:02:43.352 --> 00:02:45.943
and wily pathogens known to humankind.

00:02:45.943 --> 00:02:49.283
It lives half its life inside the cold-blooded mosquito

00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:53.685
and half its life inside the warm-blooded human.

00:02:53.685 --> 00:02:56.683
These two environments are totally different,

00:02:56.683 --> 00:02:59.699
but not only that, they're both utterly hostile.

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:03.706
So the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite,

00:03:03.706 --> 00:03:06.667
and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off.

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:10.417
This little creature survives under siege like that,

00:03:10.417 --> 00:03:13.492
but not only does it survive, it has thrived.

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:17.814
It has spread. It has more ways to evade attack than we know.

00:03:17.814 --> 00:03:19.928
It's a shape-shifter, for one thing.

00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:23.087
Just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly,

00:03:23.087 --> 00:03:25.726
the malaria parasite transforms itself like that

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:28.949
seven times in its life cycle.

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.206
And each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other,

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:36.270
they have totally different physiology.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.262
So say you came up with some great drug

00:03:38.262 --> 00:03:41.202
that worked against one stage of the parasite's life cycle.

00:03:41.202 --> 00:03:44.667
It might do nothing at all to any of the other stages.

00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:47.530
It can hide in our bodies, undetected,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.894
unbeknownst to us, for days, for weeks,

00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:53.693
for months, for years, in some cases even decades.

00:03:53.693 --> 00:03:58.077
So the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle,

00:03:58.077 --> 00:04:01.282
but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite.

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.580
Only about 12 species of mosquitos

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.514
carry most of the world's malaria,

00:04:05.514 --> 00:04:07.990
and we know quite a bit about the kinds of

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.915
watery habitats that they specialize in.

00:04:10.915 --> 00:04:13.197
So you might think, then, well, why don't we just

00:04:13.197 --> 00:04:16.353
avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live? Right?

00:04:16.353 --> 00:04:18.631
We could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live

00:04:18.631 --> 00:04:21.390
and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.620
But say you live in the tropics

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.893
and you walk outside your hut one day

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:29.915
and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:31.838
around your home.

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:35.068
Or say your cow does, or say your pig does,

00:04:35.068 --> 00:04:37.202
and then, say, it rains,

00:04:37.202 --> 00:04:39.570
and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.651
That's it. You've created the perfect

00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:45.229
malarial mosquito habitat that's right outside your door.

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.091
So it's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects.

00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:50.725
We kind of create places that they love to live

00:04:50.725 --> 00:04:52.724
just by living our own lives.

00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:54.103
So there's a huge scientific challenge,

00:04:54.103 --> 00:04:56.310
but there's a huge economic challenge too.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.245
Malaria occurs in some of the poorest

00:04:58.245 --> 00:05:00.184
and most remote places on Earth,

00:05:00.184 --> 00:05:02.029
and there's a reason for that.

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:04.729
If you're poor, you're more likely to get malaria.

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.882
If you're poor, you're more likely to live

00:05:06.882 --> 00:05:10.951
in rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained.

00:05:10.951 --> 00:05:13.540
These are places where mosquitos breed.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.140
You're less likely to have door screens or window screens.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.043
You're less likely to have electricity

00:05:19.043 --> 00:05:22.049
and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible,

00:05:22.049 --> 00:05:23.282
so you're outside more.

00:05:23.282 --> 00:05:25.614
You're getting bitten by mosquitos more.

00:05:25.614 --> 00:05:27.239
So poverty causes malaria,

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:30.272
but what we also know now is that malaria itself

00:05:30.272 --> 00:05:31.919
causes poverty.

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.570
For one thing, it strikes hardest during harvest season,

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.326
so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields

00:05:37.326 --> 00:05:41.235
collecting their crops, they're home sick with a fever.

00:05:41.235 --> 00:05:44.096
But it also predisposes people to death

00:05:44.096 --> 00:05:45.881
from all other causes.

00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:47.241
So this has happened historically.

00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:50.623
We've been able to take malaria out of a society.

00:05:50.623 --> 00:05:52.080
Everything else stays the same,

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.755
so we still have bad food, bad water, bad sanitation,

00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:56.516
all the things that make people sick.

00:05:56.516 --> 00:05:58.660
But just if you take malaria out,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.472
deaths from everything else go down.

00:06:02.472 --> 00:06:05.183
And the economist Jeff Sachs has actually quantified

00:06:05.183 --> 00:06:07.368
what this means for a society.

00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:10.122
What it means is, if you have malaria in your society,

00:06:10.122 --> 00:06:12.583
your economic growth is depressed

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:16.553
by 1.3 percent every year,

00:06:16.553 --> 00:06:20.352
year after year after year, just this one disease alone.

00:06:20.352 --> 00:06:22.916
So this poses a huge economic challenge,

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:25.100
because say you do come up with your great drug

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.310
or your great vaccine -- how do you deliver it

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.880
in a place where there's no roads,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.073
there's no infrastructure,

00:06:31.073 --> 00:06:34.407
there's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold,

00:06:34.407 --> 00:06:37.127
there's no clinics, there's no clinicians

00:06:37.127 --> 00:06:39.661
to deliver these things where they're needed?

00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:43.664
So there's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria.

00:06:43.664 --> 00:06:46.720
But along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge,

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.532
there's also a cultural challenge,

00:06:48.532 --> 00:06:51.917
and this is probably the part about malaria

00:06:51.917 --> 00:06:54.218
that people don't like to talk about.

00:06:54.218 --> 00:06:56.929
And it's the paradox that the people

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:58.737
who have the most malaria in the world

00:06:58.737 --> 00:07:01.317
tend to care about it the least.

00:07:01.317 --> 00:07:04.729
This has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again.

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:07.496
They ask people in malarious parts of the world,

00:07:07.496 --> 00:07:09.552
"What do you think about malaria?"

00:07:09.552 --> 00:07:13.461
And they don't say, "It's a killer disease. We're scared of it."

00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:18.799
They say, "Malaria is a normal problem of life."

00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:20.565
And that was certainly my personal experience.

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.584
When I told my relatives in India

00:07:22.584 --> 00:07:24.068
that I was writing a book about malaria,

00:07:24.068 --> 00:07:26.035
they kind of looked at me like

00:07:26.035 --> 00:07:28.736
I told them I was writing a book about warts or something.

00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:31.783
Like, why would you write about something so boring,

00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:33.449
so ordinary? You know?

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:36.177
And it's simple risk perception, really.

00:07:36.177 --> 00:07:38.612
A child in Malawi, for example,

00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:43.424
she might have 12 episodes of malaria before the age of two,

00:07:43.424 --> 00:07:45.477
but if she survives,

00:07:45.477 --> 00:07:48.091
she'll continue to get malaria throughout her life,

00:07:48.091 --> 00:07:50.814
but she's much less likely to die of it.

00:07:50.814 --> 00:07:52.766
And so in her lived experience,

00:07:52.766 --> 00:07:56.097
malaria is something that comes and goes.

00:07:56.097 --> 00:07:58.127
And that's actually true for most of the world's malaria.

00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:01.704
Most of the world's malaria comes and goes on its own.

00:08:01.704 --> 00:08:04.828
It's just, there's so much malaria

00:08:04.828 --> 00:08:08.599
that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:11.560
add up to this big, huge number.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.553
So I think people in malarious parts of the world

00:08:13.553 --> 00:08:15.075
must think of malaria the way

00:08:15.075 --> 00:08:16.734
those of us who live in the temperate world

00:08:16.734 --> 00:08:18.985
think of cold and flu. Right?

00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:22.391
Cold and flu have a huge burden on our societies

00:08:22.391 --> 00:08:24.072
and on our own lives,

00:08:24.072 --> 00:08:25.336
but we don't really even take

00:08:25.336 --> 00:08:27.878
the most rudimentary precautions against it because

00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:30.599
we consider it normal to get cold and flu

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:32.836
during cold and flu season.

00:08:32.836 --> 00:08:37.248
And so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria,

00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:41.022
because if people think it's normal to have malaria,

00:08:41.022 --> 00:08:44.480
then how do you get them to run to the doctor

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.626
to get diagnosed, to pick up their prescription,

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:49.148
to get it filled, to take the drugs,

00:08:49.148 --> 00:08:52.627
to put on the repellents, to tuck in the bed nets?

00:08:52.627 --> 00:08:57.294
This is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease.

00:08:57.294 --> 00:08:58.796
So take all that together.

00:08:58.796 --> 00:09:03.248
We've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated,

00:09:03.248 --> 00:09:05.676
it's economically challenging to deal with,

00:09:05.676 --> 00:09:07.321
and it's one for which the people who stand

00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:09.625
to benefit the most care about it the least.

00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:11.713
And that adds up to the biggest problem of all,

00:09:11.713 --> 00:09:14.662
which, of course, is the political problem.

00:09:14.662 --> 00:09:17.520
How do you get a political leader to do anything

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.581
about a problem like this?

00:09:19.581 --> 00:09:24.206
And the answer is, historically, you don't.

00:09:24.206 --> 00:09:26.339
Most malarious societies throughout history

00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:28.455
have simply lived with the disease.

00:09:28.455 --> 00:09:30.458
So the main attacks on malaria have come

00:09:30.458 --> 00:09:33.082
from outside of malarious societies,

00:09:33.082 --> 00:09:34.876
from people who aren't constrained

00:09:34.876 --> 00:09:37.855
by these rather paralyzing politics.

00:09:37.855 --> 00:09:41.150
But this, I think, introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.570
The first concerted attack against malaria

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.316
started in the 1950s.

00:09:45.316 --> 00:09:48.406
It was the brainchild of the U.S. State Department.

00:09:48.406 --> 00:09:51.443
And this effort well understood the economic challenge.

00:09:51.443 --> 00:09:54.924
They knew they had to focus on cheap, easy-to-use tools,

00:09:54.924 --> 00:09:56.699
and they focused on DDT.

00:09:56.699 --> 00:09:58.138
They understood the cultural challenge.

00:09:58.138 --> 00:10:01.143
In fact, their rather patronizing view was that

00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:04.046
people at risk of malaria shouldn't be asked to do anything at all.

00:10:04.046 --> 00:10:07.768
Everything should be done to them and for them.

00:10:07.768 --> 00:10:10.888
But they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge.

00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:13.215
They had so much faith in their tools

00:10:13.215 --> 00:10:16.206
that they stopped doing malaria research.

00:10:16.206 --> 00:10:18.674
And so when those tools started to fail,

00:10:18.674 --> 00:10:21.374
and public opinion started to turn against those tools,

00:10:21.374 --> 00:10:25.568
they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do.

00:10:25.568 --> 00:10:29.019
The whole campaign crashed, malaria resurged back,

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:30.833
but now it was even worse than before

00:10:30.833 --> 00:10:33.594
because it was corralled into the hardest-to-reach places

00:10:33.594 --> 00:10:36.780
in the most difficult-to-control forms.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.079
One WHO official at the time actually called that whole campaign

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:45.136
"one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health."

00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:47.643
The latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s.

00:10:47.643 --> 00:10:51.355
It's similarly directed and financed primarily

00:10:51.355 --> 00:10:53.503
from outside of malarious societies.

00:10:53.503 --> 00:10:56.007
Now this effort well understands the scientific challenge.

00:10:56.007 --> 00:10:58.228
They are doing tons of malaria research.

00:10:58.228 --> 00:11:00.681
And they understand the economic challenge too.

00:11:00.681 --> 00:11:04.241
They're focusing on very cheap, very easy-to-use tools.

00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:08.133
But now, I think, the dilemma is the cultural challenge.

00:11:08.133 --> 00:11:11.767
The centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net.

00:11:11.767 --> 00:11:13.543
It's treated with insecticides.

00:11:13.543 --> 00:11:15.913
This thing has been distributed across the malarious world

00:11:15.913 --> 00:11:17.346
by the millions.

00:11:17.346 --> 00:11:19.578
And when you think about the bed net,

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:22.137
it's sort of a surgical intervention.

00:11:22.137 --> 00:11:24.283
You know, it doesn't really have any value

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:27.946
to a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria.

00:11:27.946 --> 00:11:31.955
And yet we're asking people to use these nets every night.

00:11:31.955 --> 00:11:33.232
They have to sleep under them every night.

00:11:33.232 --> 00:11:35.269
That's the only way they are effective.

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:36.622
And they have to do that

00:11:36.622 --> 00:11:39.708
even if the net blocks the breeze,

00:11:39.708 --> 00:11:42.853
even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night

00:11:42.853 --> 00:11:44.387
and relieve themselves,

00:11:44.387 --> 00:11:46.636
even if they might have to move all their furnishings

00:11:46.636 --> 00:11:48.103
to put this thing up,

00:11:48.103 --> 00:11:50.956
even if, you know, they might live in a round hut

00:11:50.956 --> 00:11:54.693
in which it's difficult to string up a square net.

00:11:54.693 --> 00:11:59.631
Now that's no big deal if you're fighting a killer disease.

00:11:59.631 --> 00:12:01.962
I mean, these are minor inconveniences.

00:12:01.962 --> 00:12:05.801
But that's not how people with malaria think of malaria.

00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:10.681
So for them, the calculus must be quite different.

00:12:10.681 --> 00:12:14.599
Imagine, for example, if a bunch of well-meaning Kenyans

00:12:14.599 --> 00:12:16.680
came up to those of us in the temperate world and said,

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.502
"You know, you people have a lot of cold and flu.

00:12:19.502 --> 00:12:22.630
We've designed this great, easy-to-use, cheap tool,

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.700
we're going to give it to you for free.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.133
It's called a face mask,

00:12:25.133 --> 00:12:29.006
and all you need to do is

00:12:29.006 --> 00:12:31.416
wear it every day during cold and flu season

00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:34.170
when you go to school and when you go to work."

00:12:34.185 --> 00:12:36.115
Would we do that?

00:12:36.115 --> 00:12:38.251
And I wonder if that's how people

00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:40.317
in the malarious world thought of those nets

00:12:40.317 --> 00:12:42.020
when they first received them?

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.418
Indeed, we know from studies

00:12:45.418 --> 00:12:48.096
that only 20 percent of the bed nets

00:12:48.096 --> 00:12:51.264
that were first distributed were actually used.

00:12:51.264 --> 00:12:52.975
And even that's probably an overestimate,

00:12:52.975 --> 00:12:55.397
because the same people who distributed the nets

00:12:55.397 --> 00:12:56.888
went back and asked the recipients,

00:12:56.888 --> 00:12:59.361
"Oh, did you use that net I gave you?"

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:01.973
Which is like your Aunt Jane asking you,

00:13:01.973 --> 00:13:04.934
"Oh, did you use that vase I gave you for Christmas?"

00:13:04.934 --> 00:13:06.800
So it's probably an overestimate.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.124
But that's not an insurmountable problem.

00:13:10.124 --> 00:13:11.954
We can do more education,

00:13:11.954 --> 00:13:14.629
we can try to convince these people to use the nets.

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:15.904
And that's what happening now.

00:13:15.904 --> 00:13:17.608
We're throwing a lot more time and money

00:13:17.608 --> 00:13:22.125
into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays

00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:24.538
and school meetings,

00:13:24.538 --> 00:13:26.833
all these things to convince people

00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:29.317
to use the nets we gave you.

00:13:29.317 --> 00:13:31.457
And that might work.

00:13:31.457 --> 00:13:34.135
But it takes time. It takes money.

00:13:34.135 --> 00:13:36.915
It takes resources. It takes infrastructure.

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:39.597
It takes all the things that that cheap,

00:13:39.597 --> 00:13:42.376
easy-to-use bed net was not supposed to be.

00:13:42.376 --> 00:13:45.780
So it's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.318
but it's equally tricky when we try to attack it

00:13:48.318 --> 00:13:51.128
from outside of those societies.

00:13:51.128 --> 00:13:52.915
We end up imposing our own priorities

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.459
on the people of the malarious world.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:57.253
That's exactly what we did in the 1950s,

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.131
and that effort backfired.

00:13:59.131 --> 00:14:00.762
I would argue today,

00:14:00.762 --> 00:14:04.992
when we are distributing tools that we've designed

00:14:04.992 --> 00:14:08.745
and that don't necessarily make sense in people's lives,

00:14:08.745 --> 00:14:12.298
we run the risk of making the same mistake again.

00:14:12.298 --> 00:14:14.106
That's not to say that malaria is unconquerable,

00:14:14.106 --> 00:14:15.569
because I think it is,

00:14:15.569 --> 00:14:17.777
but what if we attacked this disease

00:14:17.777 --> 00:14:21.320
according to the priorities of the people who lived with it?

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.756
Take the example of England and the United States.

00:14:23.756 --> 00:14:26.927
We had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years,

00:14:26.927 --> 00:14:29.085
and we got rid of it completely,

00:14:29.085 --> 00:14:32.094
not because we attacked malaria. We didn't.

00:14:32.094 --> 00:14:36.201
We attacked bad roads and bad houses

00:14:36.201 --> 00:14:41.083
and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty.

00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:44.400
We attacked the malarious way of life,

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:50.120
and by doing that, we slowly built malaria out.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.758
Now attacking the malarious way of life,

00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:55.320
this is something -- these are things people care about today.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.707
And attacking the malarious way of life,

00:14:57.707 --> 00:15:02.466
it's not fast, it's not cheap, it's not easy,

00:15:02.466 --> 00:15:05.534
but I think it's the only lasting way forward.

00:15:05.534 --> 00:15:06.827
Thank you so much.

00:15:06.827 --> 00:15:12.274
