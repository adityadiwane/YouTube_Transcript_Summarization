00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.160
I'm a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
I show a number of photographs and films,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.160
but I also make television programs, books and some advertising,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
all with the same concept.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.160
And it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
and the importance of the image:

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
celebrity is born of photography.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.160
I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
when Princess Diana died.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
There was a sort of a standstill in Britain

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
the moment of her death,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.160
and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
I was fascinated by this phenomenon,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
so I wondered:

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
could one erase the image of Diana, actually quite crudely and physically?

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.160
So, I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.160
but I couldn't erase this from my memory

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.160
and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
Momentum was being built.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
The press wrote about her death in rather, I felt, pornographic ways --

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
like, "Which bit of artery left which bit of body?"

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
and "How did she die in the back of the car?" --

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.160
and I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.160
so I made these rather gory images.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.160
I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.160
so I got a look-alike of Diana

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
and posed her in the right positions and angles

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.160
and created something that was in, or existed in, the public imagination.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
So people were wondering: was she going to marry Dodi?

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
Was she in love with him?

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
Was she pregnant? Did she want his baby?

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
Was she pregnant when she died?

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
So I created this image of Diana, Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.160
and this image came out, which caused a huge public outcry at the time.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.160
I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
so I started making reference to media imagery --

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.160
made it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth --

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
to titillate the public or the viewer further

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.160
in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.160
So, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
and this was a sequence of images.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.160
And this gets shown in art galleries like this, as a sequence.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.160
And similarly with the Di-Dodian baby imagery --

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
this is another art gallery installation.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
I'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.160
This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
but you think it's Camilla and the Queen,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.160
and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
And the camera can lie,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
and it makes it very, very easy

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.160
with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.160
So, I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:42.160
and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.160
And at the same time, it removes us from the real subject matter,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.160
and this acts as a sort of titillating thing.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.160
So, the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism;

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.160
what you can't have, you want more.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
In the photograph, the real subject doesn't exist

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.160
so it makes you want that person more.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
And that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now:

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
the more pictures you see of these celebrities,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
the more you feel you know them,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
but you don't know them

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.160
and you want to know them further.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.160
Of course, the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.160
watch her horses. (Laughter).

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
And then I was sort of making imagery.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
In England there's an expression: "you can't imagine the Queen on the loo."

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
So I'm trying to penetrate that.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
Well, here is the image.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
All this imagery was creating a lot of fuss

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.160
and I was cited as a disgusting artist. The press were writing about this,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.160
giving full pages about how terrible this was.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle:

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
I was making comments about the press

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.160
and about how we know facts and information only by media --

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
because we don't know the real people;

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
very few of us know the real people --

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
but it was going back into the press

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.160
and they were publicizing, effectively, my filthy work.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.160
So, these are broadsheets, tabloids, debates were being had all about this work,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.160
films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
politicians were getting involved --

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
all sorts of things -- great headlines.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
Then suddenly, it started to get on front pages.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
I was being asked and paid to do front covers.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
Suddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
which I found also fascinating.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.160
How one moment -- it was disgusting --

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
saying my work was wonderful,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.160
But then this changed suddenly.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.160
I then started to work for magazines and newspapers.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
This was, for example, an image that went into Tatler.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.160
This was another newspaper image.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
It was an April fool actually, and to this day some people think it's real.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
and they were saying there's this great image of the Queen

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
sitting outside William Hill.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
They thought it was real.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.160
I was exploring, at the time, the hyperbole of icons --

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.160
and Diana and Marilyn -- and the importance of celebrity in our lives.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
How they wheedle their way into the collective psyche

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
without us even knowing,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
and how that should happen.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
There's me as Diana --

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
I look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley, I think, in this one. (Laughter).

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
And me as the Queen.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:04.160
I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn --

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
the biggest icon of all --

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.160
and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
and only showing certain angles to create a reality that, obviously,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.160
is completely constructed.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.160
This is the look-alike, so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
She looks nothing like Marilyn,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
but by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.160
she looks exactly like Marilyn,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
to the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her --

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.160
or recognize this look-alike -- in these photographs,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
which I find quite interesting.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.160
So, all this work is getting shown in art galleries.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
Then I made a book.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
Stills from the TV series went into this book.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
But there was a real legal problem because it looks real,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.160
but how do you get over that?

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
Because obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now:

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
that we can't tell what's real.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
How do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:18.160
So, from my point of view, it's important to publish it,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
but at the same time it does cause a confusion --

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.160
intentional on my behalf,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
but problematic for any outlet that I'm working with.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.160
So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.160
and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:44.160
and comments about our public figures.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:55.160
You know, what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
And also dealing with the perceptions that are put about

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:05.160
Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, the links that were put about pre-Iraq war.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:12.160
And what is going to happen to the monarchy?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.160
Because obviously the British public,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.160
I think, would prefer William to Charles on the throne.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.160
And it's that wish, or that desire, that I suppose I'm dealing with in my work.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
I'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
I'm interested in the perception of the celebrity.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.160
And with some look-alikes, they are so good

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.160
you don't know whether they're real or not.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.160
I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes, which is Coca-Cola,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.160
and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
It's highly commercial.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160
But it was a difficulty for me -- because this is my artwork;

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.160
should I do advertising? -- at the time.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.160
So I made sure the work was not compromised in any way

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160
and that the integrity of the work remained the same.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.160
But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:20.160
you're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160
and that's all you're doing.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.160
When you take the logo off, you're opening up the interpretations

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.160
and making the work inconclusive,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
opposed to conclusive when you are advertising.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
This image is quite interesting, actually,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
because I think we made it three years ago.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.160
And it's Camilla in her wedding dress, which, again,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.160
nearly got re-used now, recently prior to her wedding.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
Tony Blair and Cherie. And again, the legalities -- we had to be very careful.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.160
It's obviously a very big commercial company, and so this little,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.160
"Shh -- it's not really them,"

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.160
was put on the side of the imagery.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.160
And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.160
I then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:24.160
so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes --

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
live scenes with look-alikes inside the windows,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.160
and the windows were all steamed up.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160
So, it's Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech;

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
I've got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin;

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.160
Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson, who he was having an affair with at that time.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.160
This was a huge success for them

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.160
because the imagery got shown in the press the day after

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.160
in every single newspaper, broadsheets and tabloids.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.160
It was a bit of a road stopper, which was problematic

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.160
but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.160
Also, people were taking photographs of this,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.160
so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly, all this imagery.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:20.160
And the press were interviewing, and I was signing my book. (Laughter).

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
Further imagery. I'm making a new book now with Taschen

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.160
that I'm working on really for a sort of global market --

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.160
my previous book was only for the U.K. market --

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.160
that I suppose it could be called humorous.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160
I suppose I come from a sort of non-humorous background

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
with serious intent,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.160
and then suddenly my work is funny.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:51.160
And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way;

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.160
I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.160
and how we read all our information through imagery.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.160
It's an extremely fast way of getting information.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.160
It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.160
and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
This image, for example, is sort of spot-on

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:18.160
because it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:25.160
and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein, and George Bush

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.160
reading the Koran upside-down.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
For example, George Bush target practice --

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.160
shooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
And then you change the photograph he's shooting at,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.160
and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible. (Laughter).

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.160
Tony Blair being used as a mounting block,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.160
and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.160
and the seriousness, or the intellect, of Bush.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.160
And also, commenting on the behind the scenes --

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.160
well, as we know now -- what goes on in prisons.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160
And in fact, George Bush and Tony Blair

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
are having great fun during all of this.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
And really commenting, you know,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
based on the perception we have of the celebrities.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
What Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.160
and golf-clubbed a driver the other day.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
I mean, it's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.160
so I'm constantly going up to people in the street

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:42.160
and trying to ask people to come

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
and be in one of my photographs or films.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160
And sometimes asking the real celebrity,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
which is highly embarrassing. (Laughter).

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.160
I've also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis --

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.160
a page a week in their newspaper --

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
which has been very interesting, working topically.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.160
So, Jamie Oliver and school dinners;

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture;

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
the whole of the hunting issue,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.160
and the royal family refusing to stop hunting;

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.160
and the tsunami issues; and obviously Harry;

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.160
Blair's views on Gordon Brown, which I find very interesting;

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:30.160
Condi and Bush.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.160
This image I've decided to show having a reservation about it.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:41.160
I made it a year ago. And just how meanings change,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.160
and there were a terrible thing that has happened,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.160
but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
That's why this image was made one year ago,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.160
and what it means today.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:02.160
So, I'll leave you with these clips to have a look. (Music)

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.160
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
