00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
How can we investigate

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.160
this flora of viruses that surround us, and aid medicine?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.160
How can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.160
into a simple, hand-held, single diagnostic assay?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
I want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
and the spectrum of viruses that are out there

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
into, let's say, a small chip.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
When we started thinking about this project --

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
how we would make a single diagnostic assay

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
to screen for all pathogens simultaneously --

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
well, there's some problems with this idea.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
First of all, viruses are pretty complex,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
but they're also evolving very fast.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.160
This is a picornavirus.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
Picornaviruses -- these are things that include

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
the common cold and polio, things like this.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
You're looking at the outside shell of the virus,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
that are evolving very, very fast,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
and the blue parts are not evolving very fast.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
When people think about making pan-viral detection reagents,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.160
usually it's the fast-evolving problem that's an issue,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
because how can we detect things if they're always changing?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
But evolution is a balance:

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160
where you have fast change, you also have ultra-conservation --

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
things that almost never change.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
And so we looked into this a little more carefully,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.160
and I'm going to show you data now.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
This is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
I took a bunch of these small picornaviruses,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
like the common cold, like polio and so on,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.160
and I just broke them down into small segments.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
And so took this first example, which is called coxsackievirus,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
and just break it into small windows.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
And I'm coloring these small windows blue

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.160
if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160
to that virus.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
These sequences right up here --

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
which don't even code for protein, by the way --

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
are almost absolutely identical across all of these,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.160
so I could use this sequence as a marker

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
to detect a wide spectrum of viruses,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
without having to make something individual.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
Now, over here there's great diversity:

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
that's where things are evolving fast.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
Down here you can see slower evolution: less diversity.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
Now, by the time we get out here to, let's say,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
acute bee paralysis virus --

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
probably a bad one to have if you're a bee ---

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.160
this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.160
but I can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
among these viruses on the right-hand of the screen

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
are in identical regions right up here.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
And so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra-conservation

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
through evolution -- how these viruses evolved --

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
by just choosing DNA elements or RNA elements

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.160
in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
OK, so that's what we did, but how are we going to do that?

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
Well, for a long time, since I was in graduate school,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
I've been messing around making DNA chips --

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
that is, printing DNA on glass.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.160
And that's what you see here:

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
These little salt spots are just DNA tacked onto glass,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
and so I can put thousands of these on our glass chip

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
and use them as a detection reagent.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
We took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
and this is what you see:

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
So, what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass --

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.160
little flat things -- and these are going to be markers for pathogens.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
OK, I make little robots in lab to make these chips,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
and I'm really big on disseminating technology.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
If you've got enough money to buy just a Camry,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
you can build one of these too,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.160
and so we put a deep how-to guide on the Web, totally free,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
with basically order-off-the-shelf parts.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
You can build a DNA array machine in your garage.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
Here's the section on the all-important emergency stop switch.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
(Laughter)

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
Every important machine's got to have a big red button.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
But really, it's pretty robust.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
You can actually be making DNA chips in your garage

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.160
(Laughter)

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160
And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project --

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
we just started by making a respiratory virus chip.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
I talked about that --

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
you know, that situation where you go into the clinic

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
and you don't get diagnosed?

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
Well, we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
on one chip, and we threw in herpes virus for good measure --

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.160
I mean, why not?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
The first thing you do as a scientist is,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.160
you make sure stuff works.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.160
And so what we did is, we take tissue culture cells

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
and infect them with various viruses,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160
and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells --

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.160
mostly viral stuff -- and stick it on the array to see where it sticks.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
Now, if the DNA sequences match, they'll stick together,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
and so we can look at spots.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
And if spots light up, we know there's a certain virus in there.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
That's what one of these chips really looks like,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
and these red spots are, in fact, signals coming from the virus.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
And each spot represents a different family of virus

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160
or species of virus.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
And so, that's a hard way to look at things,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
grouped by family, so you can see the results in a very intuitive way.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
What we did is, we took tissue culture cells

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
and infected them with adenovirus,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.160
and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
And, likewise, we infected them with parainfluenza-3 --

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
that's a paramyxovirus -- and you see a little barcode here.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
And then we did respiratory syncytial virus.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere --

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
it's like boogeremia, basically.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.160
(Laughter)

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.160
You can see that this barcode is the same family,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
but it's distinct from parainfluenza-3,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
which gives you a very bad cold.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
And so we're getting unique signatures, a fingerprint for each virus.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
Polio and rhino: they're in the same family, very close to each other.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
Rhino's the common cold, and you all know what polio is,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
and you can see that these signatures are distinct.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
And Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
gives a nice signature down here.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
And so it is not any one stripe or something

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here;

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.160
it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
All right, I can see a rhinovirus --

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
and here's the blow-up of the rhinovirus's little barcode --

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
but what about different rhinoviruses?

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
How do I know which rhinovirus I have?

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.160
There're 102 known variants of the common cold,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
and there're only 102 because people got bored collecting them:

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
there are just new ones every year.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160
And so, here are four different rhinoviruses,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
and you can see, even with your eye,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
without any fancy computer pattern-matching

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
recognition software algorithms,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160
that you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Now, this is kind of a cheap shot,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
because I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.160
and I in fact designed the chip

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
expressly to be able to tell them apart,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.160
but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer?

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
We don't know what the sequence is; just pull them out of the field.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
So, here are four rhinoviruses

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
we never knew anything about --

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
no one's ever sequenced them -- and you can also see

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
that you get unique and distinguishable patterns.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
You can imagine building up some library, whether real or virtual,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.160
of fingerprints of essentially every virus.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
But that's, again, shooting fish in a barrel, you know, right?

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
You have tissue culture cells. There are a ton of viruses.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
What about real people?

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
You can't control real people, as you probably know.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.160
You have no idea what someone's going to cough into a cup,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
and it's probably really complex, right?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
It could have lots of bacteria, it could have more than one virus,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
and it certainly has host genetic material.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.160
So how do we deal with this?

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
And how do we do the positive control here?

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
Well, it's pretty simple.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
That's me, getting a nasal lavage.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.160
And the idea is, let's experimentally inoculate people with virus.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.160
This is all IRB-approved, by the way; they got paid.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
And basically we experimentally inoculate people

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160
with the common cold virus.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
Or, even better, let's just take people

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.160
right out of the emergency room --

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.160
undefined, community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
You have no idea what walks in through the door.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
So, let's start off with the positive control first,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
where we know the person was healthy.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
They got a shot of virus up the nose,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.160
let's see what happens.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
Day zero: nothing happening.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
They're healthy; they're clean -- it's amazing.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
Actually, we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160
even when you're walking around healthy.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
It's pretty clean. If you're healthy, you're pretty healthy.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.160
Day two: we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
and it's very similar to what we get in the lab

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.160
doing our tissue culture experiment.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
So that's great, but again, cheap shot, right?

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
We put a ton of virus up this guy's nose. So --

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160
(Laughter)

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.160
-- I mean, we wanted it to work. He really had a cold.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.160
So, how about the people who walk in off the street?

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
Here are two individuals represented by their anonymous ID codes.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.160
They both have rhinoviruses; we've never seen this pattern in lab.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
We sequenced part of their viruses;

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
they're new rhinoviruses no one's actually even seen.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
Remember, our evolutionary-conserved sequences

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
we're using on this array allow us to detect

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
even novel or uncharacterized viruses,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.160
because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
Here's another guy. You can play the diagnosis game yourself here.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
These different blocks represent

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.160
so you can kind of go down the blocks

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
and see where the signal is.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.160
Well, doesn't have canine distemper; that's probably good.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
(Laughter)

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
But by the time you get to block nine,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
you see that respiratory syncytial virus.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.160
Maybe they have kids. And then you can see, also,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
the family member that's related: RSVB is showing up here.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.160
So, that's great.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
Here's another individual, sampled on two separate days --

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
repeat visits to the clinic.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
This individual has parainfluenza-1,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
and you can see that there's a little stripe over here

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
for Sendai virus: that's mouse parainfluenza.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.160
The genetic relationships are very close there. That's a lot of fun.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.160
So, we built out the chip.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.160
We made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
Why not? Every plant virus, every insect virus, every marine virus.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
Everything that we could get out of GenBank --

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
that is, the national repository of sequences.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
Now we're using this chip. And what are we using it for?

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
Well, first of all, when you have a big chip like this,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
you need a little bit more informatics,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
And the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
because we're never going to get samples of every virus --

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
it would be virtually impossible. But we can get virtual patterns,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
and compare them to our observed result --

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.160
which is a very complex mixture -- and come up with some sort of score

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
And this is what this looks like.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.160
If, for example, you used a cell culture

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
that's chronically infected with papilloma,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.160
you get a little computer readout here,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.160
and our algorithm says it's probably papilloma type 18.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
And that is, in fact, what these particular cell cultures

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
are chronically infected with.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160
So let's do something a little bit harder.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.160
We put the beeper in the clinic.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160
When somebody shows up, and the hospital doesn't know what to do

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160
because they can't diagnose it, they call us.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
That's the idea, and we're setting this up in the Bay Area.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
And so, this case report happened three weeks ago.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
We have a 28-year-old healthy woman, no travel history,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
[unclear], doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.160
10-day history of fevers, night sweats, bloody sputum --

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
she's coughing up blood -- muscle pain.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.160
She went to the clinic, and they gave her antibiotics

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.160
and then sent her home.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.160
She came back after ten days of fever, right? Still has the fever,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.160
and she's hypoxic -- she doesn't have much oxygen in her lungs.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160
They did a CT scan.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.160
A normal lung is all sort of dark and black here.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
All this white stuff -- it's not good.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.160
This sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation;

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
there's likely to be infection.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.160
OK. So, the patient was treated then

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.160
with a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.160
and on day three, it didn't help: she had progressed to acute failure.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
They had to intubate her, so they put a tube down her throat

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.160
and they began to mechanically ventilate her.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
She could no longer breathe for herself.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
What to do next? Don't know.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.160
Switch antibiotics: so they switched to another antibiotic,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
Tamiflu.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
It's not clear why they thought she had the flu,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160
but they switched to Tamiflu.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
And on day six, they basically threw in the towel.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.160
You do an open lung biopsy when you've got no other options.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
There's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure,

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
and so basically -- and what do they learn from it?

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160
You're looking at her open lung biopsy.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
And I'm no pathologist, but you can't tell much from this.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
All you can tell is, there's a lot of swelling: bronchiolitis.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
It was "unrevealing": that's the pathologist's report.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
And so, what did they test her for?

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.160
They have their own tests, of course,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
and so they tested her for over 70 different assays,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.160
for every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
you can buy off the shelf:

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
SARS, metapneumovirus, HIV, RSV -- all these.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.160
Everything came back negative, over 100,000 dollars worth of tests.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.160
I mean, they went to the max for this woman.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160
And basically on hospital day eight, that's when they called us.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
They gave us endotracheal aspirate --

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
you know, a little fluid from the throat,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
from this tube that they got down there -- and they gave us this.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.160
We put it on the chip; what do we see? Well, we saw parainfluenza-4.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
Well, what the hell's parainfluenza-4?

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
No one tests for parainfluenza-4. No one cares about it.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
In fact, it's not even really sequenced that much.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
There's just a little bit of it sequenced.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.160
There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
No one would even consider it,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160
And why is that? Just lore. There's no data --

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.160
no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
Clearly, we have a case of a healthy person that's going down.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
OK, that's one case report.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.160
that's unpublished -- it's going to come out tomorrow --

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.160
and it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160
to find something new and open a new door.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.160
Prostate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160
about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it:

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.160
Lots of risk factors,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.160
but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.160
For maybe about 10 percent of prostate cancer,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
there are folks that are predisposed to it.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.160
And the first gene that was mapped in association studies

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.160
for this, early-onset prostate cancer, was this gene called RNASEL.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160
What is that? It's an antiviral defense enzyme.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
So, we're sitting around and thinking,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
"Why would men who have the mutation --

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.160
a defect in an antiviral defense system -- get prostate cancer?

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
It doesn't make sense -- unless, maybe, there's a virus?"

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:59.160
So, we put tumors --- and now we have over 100 tumors -- on our array.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
And we know who's got defects in RNASEL and who doesn't.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
And I'm showing you the signal from the chip here,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.160
and I'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
And what I'm telling you here from the signal, is

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160
that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme,

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.160
and have a tumor, often have -- 40 percent of the time --

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.160
a signature which reveals a new retrovirus.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.160
OK, that's pretty wild. What is it?

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.160
So, we clone the whole virus.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160
First of all, I'll tell you that a little automated prediction told us

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.160
it was very similar to a mouse virus.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.160
But that doesn't tell us too much,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.160
so we actually clone the whole thing.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
And the viral genome I'm showing you right here?

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
It's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new;

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.160
no one's ever seen it before.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.160
Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.160
and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
because it's infecting a species other than mice.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
And this is a little phylogenetic tree

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
to see how it's related to other viruses.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
We've done it for many patients now,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
and we can say that they're all independent infections.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.160
They all have the same virus,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.160
but they're different enough that there's reason to believe

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
that they've been independently acquired.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
Is it really in the tissue? And I'll end up with this: yes.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
We take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
and use material to actually locate the virus,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.160
and we find cells here with viral particles in them.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
These guys really do have this virus.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
Does this virus cause prostate cancer?

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.160
Nothing I'm saying here implies causality. I don't know.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
Is it a link to oncogenesis? I don't know.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.160
Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses?

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.160
Could be. And it might have nothing to do with cancer.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.160
But now it's a door.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
We have a strong association between the presence of this virus

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
and a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.160
That's where we're at.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.160
So, it opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
but that's what, you know, science is really good at.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
This was all done by folks in the lab --

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.160
I cannot take credit for most of this.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.160
This is a collaboration between myself and Don.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
This is the guy who started the project in my lab,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.160
and this is the guy who's been doing prostate stuff.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
Thank you very much. (Applause)
