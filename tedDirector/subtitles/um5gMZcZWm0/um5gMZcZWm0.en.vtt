00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.330
Once upon a time, there was a dread disease that afflicted children.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.330
And in fact, among all the diseases that existed in this land,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
it was the worst. It killed the most children.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
And along came a brilliant inventor, a scientist,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
who came up with a partial cure for that disease.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.330
And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
but it was certainly better than what they had before.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.330
And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
virtually free, and was very easy to use.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
But the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use it

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
on the youngest children, on infants, and on one-year-olds.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
And so, as a consequence, a few years later,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
another scientist -- perhaps maybe this scientist

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.330
not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
but building on the invention of the first one --

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
came up with a second cure.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
And the beauty of the second cure for this disease

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.330
was that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.330
And the problem with this cure was it was very expensive,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.330
and it was very complicated to use.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.330
And although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.330
almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
But what they did, of course, since it was so complicated and expensive,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
they only used it on the zero-year-olds and the one-year-olds.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
And they kept on using the existing cure that they had

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.330
on the two-year-olds and up.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
And this went on for quite some time. People were happy.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
They had their two cures. Until a particular mother,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.330
whose child had just turned two, died of this disease.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.330
And she thought to herself, "My child just turned two,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.330
and until the child turned two, I had always used

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.330
this complicated, expensive cure, you know, this treatment.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.330
And then the child turned two, and I started using

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
the cheap and easy treatment, and I wonder" --

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
and she wondered, like all parents who lose children wonder --

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
"if there isn't something that I could have done,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.330
like keep on using that complicated, expensive cure."

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
And she told all the other people, and she said,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
"How could it possibly be that something

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
that's cheap and simple works as well as something

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
that's complicated and expensive?"

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
And the people thought, "You know, you're right.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
It probably is the wrong thing to do to switch

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
and use the cheap and simple solution."

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
And the government, they heard her story and the other people,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
and they said, "Yeah, you're right, we should make a law.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
and not let anybody use this on their children."

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
And the people were happy. They were satisfied.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
For many years this went along, and everything was fine.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.330
But then along came a lowly economist, who had children himself,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.330
and he used the expensive and complicated treatment.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
But he knew about the cheap and simple one.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
And he thought about it, and the expensive one

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
didn't seem that great to him. So he thought,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
"I don't know anything about science, but I do know something about data,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
so maybe I should go and look at the data

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.330
and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
actually works any better than the cheap and simple one."

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
And lo and behold, when he went through the data,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
he found that it didn't look like the expensive, complicated

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
solution was any better than the cheap one,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
at least for the children who were two and older --

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
the cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.330
And so, he went forth to the people and he said,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.330
"I've made this wonderful finding:

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330
it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
and by doing so we could save ourselves 300 million dollars a year,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
and we could spend that on our children in other ways."

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.330
And the parents were very unhappy, and they said,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
"This is a terrible thing, because how can the cheap and easy thing

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.330
be as good as the hard thing?" And the government was very upset.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.330
And in particular, the people who made this expensive solution

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
were very upset because they thought,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
"How can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free?

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
We would lose all of our market."

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
And people were very angry, and they called him horrible names.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.330
And he decided that maybe he should leave the country

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.330
for a few days, and seek out some more intelligent,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
open-minded people in a place called Oxford,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.330
and come and try and tell the story at that place.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.330
And so, anyway, here I am. It's not a fairy tale.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
It's a true story about the United States today,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.330
and the disease I'm referring to is actually

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
motor vehicle accidents for children.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.330
And the free cure is adult seatbelts, and the expensive cure --

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.330
the 300-million-dollar-a-year cure -- is child car seats.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
And what I'd like to talk to you about today

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
is some of the evidence why I believe this to be true:

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
that for children two years old and up,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.330
there really is no real benefit -- proven benefit -- of car seats,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.330
in spite of the incredible energy

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
that has been devoted toward expanding the laws

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
and making it socially unacceptable

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.330
to put your children into seatbelts. And then talk about why --

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.330
what is it that makes that true?

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
And then, finally talk a little bit about a third way,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
about another technology, which is probably better than anything we have,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
but which -- there hasn't been any enthusiasm for adoption

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
precisely because people are so enamored

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
with the current car seat solution. OK.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
So, many times when you try to do research on data,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.330
it records complicated stories -- it's hard to find in the data.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
It doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
So the United States keeps a data set

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
of every fatal accident that's happened since 1975.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
So in every car crash in which at least one person dies,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
they have information on all of the people.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
So if you look at that data -- it's right up on the National Highway

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
Transportation Safety Administration's website --

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
you can just look at the raw data,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.330
and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
that's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.330
So, here is the data. Here I have, among two- to six-year-olds --

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
anyone above six, basically no one uses car seats,

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.330
so you can't compare -- 29.3 percent of the children who are unrestrained

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.330
in a crash in which at least one person dies, themselves die.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.330
If you put a child in a car seat, 18.2 percent of the children die.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
If they're wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt, in this raw data,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.330
19.4 percent die. And interestingly, wearing a lap-only seatbelt,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
16.7 percent die. And actually, the theory tells you

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
that the lap-only seatbelt's got to be worse

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.330
than the lap-and-shoulder belt. And that just reminds you

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
that when you deal with raw data, there are hundreds

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
of confounding variables that may be getting in the way.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.330
So what we do in the study is -- and this is just presenting

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.330
the same information, but turned into a figure to make it easier.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
So the yellow bar represents car seats,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.330
the orange bar lap-and-shoulder, and the red bar lap-only seatbelts.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.330
And this is all relative to unrestrained --

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.330
the bigger the bar, the better. Okay.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
So, this is the data I just showed, OK?

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
So the highest bar is what you're striving to beat.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.330
So you can control for the basic things, like how hard the crash was,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.330
what seat the child was sitting in, etc., the age of the child.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
And that's that middle set of bars.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
And so, you can see that the lap-only seatbelts

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
start to look worse once you do that.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
And then finally, the last set of bars,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
which are really controlling for everything

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
you could possibly imagine about the crash,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
50, 75, 100 different characteristics of the crash.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
And what you find is that the car seats and the lap-and-shoulder belts,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.330
when it comes to saving lives, fatalities look exactly identical.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.330
And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
And it's not just overall. It's very robust

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.330
to anything you want to look at.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
One thing that's interesting: if you look at frontal-impact crashes --

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
when the car crashes, the front hits into something --

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.330
indeed, what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
And I think this isn't just chance.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.330
In order to have the car seat approved,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
you need to pass certain federal standards,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.330
all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
But when you look at other types of crashes, like rear-impact crashes,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
indeed, the car seats don't perform as well.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
And I think that's because they've been optimized to pass,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
as we always expect people to do,

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
to optimize relative to bright-line rules

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.330
about how affected the car will be.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.330
And the other thing you might argue is,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.330
"Well, car seats have got a lot better over time.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
And so if we look at recent crashes --

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
the whole data set is almost 30 years' worth of data --

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
you won't see it in the recent crashes. The new car seats are far, far better."

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.330
But indeed, in recent crashes the lap-and-shoulder seatbelts,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
actually, are doing even better than the car seats.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.330
They say, "Well, that's impossible, that can't be."

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
And the line of argument, if you ask parents, is,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
"But car seats are so expensive and complicated,

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
and they have this big tangle of latches,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
because they are so expensive and complicated?"

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.330
It's kind of an interesting logic,

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
I think, that people use. And the other logic, they say,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
"Well, the government wouldn't have told us [to] use them

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
if they weren't much better."

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
But what's interesting is the government telling us to use them

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
is not actually based on very much.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.330
It really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
whose children died after they turned two,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.330
which has led to the passage of all these laws -- not very much on data.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.330
So you can only get so far, I think, in telling your story

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
by using these abstract statistics.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.330
And so I had some friends over to dinner, and I was asking --

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.330
we had a cookout -- I was asking them what advice they might have for me

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.330
about proving my point. They said, "Why don't you run some crash tests?"

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
And I said, "That's a great idea."

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
So we actually tried to commission some crash tests.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:45.330
And it turns out that as we called around to the independent

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
crash test companies around the country,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
none of them wanted to do our crash test

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.330
because they said, some explicitly, some not so explicitly,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
"All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.330
We can't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats."

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.330
Now, eventually, one did. Under the conditions of anonymity,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
they said they would be happy to do this test for us --

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:12.330
so anonymity, and 1,500 dollars per seat that we crashed.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
And so, we went to Buffalo, New York,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
and here is the precursor to it.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
These are the crash test dummies,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
waiting for their chance to take the center stage.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
And then, here's how the crash test works.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.330
Here, they don't actually crash the entire car, you know --

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.330
it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.330
So they just have these bench seats,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
So I just wanted you to look at this.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
And I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
car seats are so great. Look at the kid in the car seat.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
Does he not look content, ready to go,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
like he could survive anything? And then, if you look at the kid in back,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.330
it looks like he's already choking before the crash even happens.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
It's hard to believe, when you look at this, that

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
So this is going to be a crash

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
where they're going to slam this thing forward into a wall

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
at 30 miles an hour, and see what happens. OK?

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
So, let me show you what happens.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
These are three-year-old dummies, by the way.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
So here -- this is the car seat. Now watch two things:

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
watch how the head goes forward,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
and basically hits the knees -- and this is in the car seat --

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:15.330
and watch how the car seat flies around, in the rebound, up in the air.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
The car seat's moving all over the place.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
Bear in mind there are two things about this.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.330
This is a car seat that was installed by someone

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
who has installed 1,000 car seats, who knew exactly how to do it.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.330
And also it turned out these bench seats

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
are the very best way to install car seats.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.330
Having a flat back makes it much easier to install them.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
And so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.330
OK? So, that kid in this crash fared very well.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
The federal standards are

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
that you have to score below a 1,000

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
to be an approved car seat on this crash,

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.330
in some metric of units which are not important.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.330
And this crash would have been about a 450.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
So this car seat was actually an above-average car seat

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
from Consumer Reports, and did quite well.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
So the next one. Now, this is the kid, same crash,

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:03.330
who is in the seatbelt. He hardly moves at all, actually,

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
relative to the other child. The funny thing is,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.330
the cam work is terrible because they've only set it up

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.330
to do the car seats, and so, they actually don't even have a way

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
to move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the rebound.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.330
Anyway, it turns out that those two crashes, that actually

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.330
the three-year-old did slightly worse. So, he gets about a 500

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.330
out of -- you know, on this range -- relative to a 400 and something.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.330
But still, if you just took that data from that crash

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
to the federal government, and said, "I have invented a new car seat.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
I would like you to approve it for selling,"

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
then they would say, "This is a fantastic new car seat, it works great.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
It only got a 500, it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000."

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.330
And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.330
into being approved as a car seat.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
So, in some sense, what this is suggesting

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.330
is that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong,

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.330
which is putting children at risk. It's just that, fundamentally,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
the car seats aren't doing much.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
So here's the crash. So these are timed at the same time,

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat --

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
at rebound, it takes a lot longer --

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.330
but there's just a lot less movement for child who's in the seatbelt.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
So, I'll show you the six-year-old crashes as well.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:10.330
The six-year-old is in a car seat, and it turns out

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:15.330
that looks terrible, but that's great. That's like a 400, OK?

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.330
So that kid would do fine in the crash.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.330
Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
And then here's the six-year-old in the seatbelt,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
and in fact, they get exactly within, you know,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.330
within one or two points of the same. So really, for the six-year-old,

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.330
the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
That's some more evidence, so in some sense --

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.330
I was criticized by a scientist, who said, "You could never publish

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
a study with an n of 4," meaning those four crashes.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.330
So I wrote him back and I said, "What about an n of 45,004?"

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
Because I had the other 45,000 other real-world crashes.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.330
And I just think that it's interesting that the idea

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
of using real-world crashes, which is very much something

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
that economists think would be the right thing to do,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
is something that scientists don't actually, usually think --

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.330
they would rather use a laboratory,

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.330
than actually 30 years of data of what we've seen

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.330
with children and with car seats.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.330
And so I think the answer to this puzzle

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
is that there's a much better solution out there,

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.330
that's gotten nobody excited because everyone

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.330
is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
And if you think from a design perspective,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
about going back to square one, and say,

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.330
"I just want to protect kids in the back seat."

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.330
I don't there's anyone in this room who'd say,

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.330
"Well, the right way to start would be,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
let's make a great seat belt for adults.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
And then, let's make this really big contraption

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.330
that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain."

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
I mean, why not start -- who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids?

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
But essentially, do something like this,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
which I don't know exactly how much it would cost to do,

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.330
but there's no reason I could see

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.330
why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.330
It's just actually -- you see, this is folding up -- it's behind the seat.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
You've got a regular seat for adults, and then you fold it down,

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.330
and the kid sits on top, and it's integrated.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:05.330
It seems to me that this can't be a very expensive solution,

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330
and it's got to work better than what we already have.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.330
So the question is, is there any hope for adoption of something like this,

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.330
which would presumably save a lot of lives?

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.330
And I think the answer, perhaps, lies in a story.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.330
The answer both to why has a car seat been so successful,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.330
and why this may someday be adopted or not,

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.330
lies in a story that my dad told me, relating to when he was a doctor

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.330
in the U.S. Air Force in England. And this is a long time ago:

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.330
you were allowed to do things then you can't do today.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.330
So, my father would have patients come in

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.330
who he thought were not really sick.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.330
And he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.330
and he'd say, "Come back in a week, if you still feel lousy."

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.330
OK, and most of them would not come back,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
but some of them would come back.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.330
And when they came back, he, still convinced they were not sick,

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:01.330
had another jar of pills. In this jar were huge horse pills.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
They were almost impossible to swallow.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:07.330
And these, to me, are the analogy for the car seats.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:11.330
People would look at these and say, "Man, this thing is so big

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.330
and so hard to swallow. If this doesn't make me feel better,

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.330
you know, what possibly could?"

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.330
And it turned out that most people wouldn't come back,

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.330
because it worked. But every once in a while,

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:26.330
there was still a patient convinced that he was sick,

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.330
and he'd come back. And my dad had a third jar of pills.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.330
And the jar of pills he had, he said,

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.330
were the tiniest little pills he could find,

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.330
so small you could barely see them.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.330
And he would say, listen, I know I gave you that huge pill,

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:42.330
that complicated, hard-to-swallow pill before,

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.330
but now I've got one that's so potent,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.330
that is really tiny and small and almost invisible.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.330
It's almost like this thing here, which you can't even see."

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.330
And it turned out that never,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
in all the times my dad gave out this pill, the really tiny pill,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.330
did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.330
So, my dad always took that as evidence

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.330
that this little, teeny, powerful pill

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:08.330
had the ultimate placebo effect. And in some sense, if that's the right story,

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.330
I think integrated car seats you will see, very quickly,

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:14.330
becoming something that everyone has. The other possible conclusion

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.330
is, well, maybe after coming to my father three times,

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.330
getting sent home with placebos, he still felt sick,

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.330
he went and found another doctor.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.330
And that's completely possible. And if that's the case,

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.330
then I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:27.330
Thank you very much.

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:31.330
(Applause)

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.330
(Audience: I just wanted to ask you, when we wear seatbelts

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.330
we don't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.330
it's also to prevent lots of serious injury.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:42.330
Your data looks at fatalities. It doesn't look at serious injury.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.330
Is there any data to show that child seats

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.330
are actually less effective, or just as effective as seatbelts

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.330
for serious injury? Because that would prove your case.)

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.330
Steven Levitt: Yeah, that's a great question. In my data, and in another data set

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.330
I've looked at for New Jersey crashes,

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:59.330
I find very small differences in injury.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.330
So in this data, it's statistically insignificant differences

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:05.330
in injury between car seats and lap-and-shoulder belts.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:06.330
In the New Jersey data, which is different,

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.330
because it's not just fatal crashes,

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.330
but all crashes in New Jersey that are reported,

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.330
it turns out that there is a 10 percent difference in injuries,

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.330
but generally they're the minor injuries.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.330
Now, what's interesting, I should say this as a disclaimer,

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.330
there is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data,

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.330
which suggests that car seats are dramatically better.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.330
And they use a completely different methodology that involves --

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.330
after the crash occurs, they get from the insurance companies

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.330
the names of the people who were in the crash,

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:35.330
and they call them on the phone,

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:36.330
and they asked them what happened.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.330
And I really can't resolve, yet,

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.330
and I'd like to work with these medical researchers

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.330
to try to understand how there can be these differences,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.330
which are completely at odds with one another.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.330
But it's obviously a critical question.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.330
The question is even if -- are there enough serious injuries

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.330
to make these cost-effective? It's kind of tricky.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.330
Even if they're right, it's not so clear

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.330
that they're so cost-effective.
