00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
and put off aging?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
This is a dream of the ages.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
But scientists have for a long time

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
thought this just was never going to be possible.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
They thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it --

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
kind of like an old shoe.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
But if you look in nature,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
you see that different kinds of animals

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
can have really different lifespans.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Now these animals are different from one another,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
because they have different genes.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
So that suggests

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
that somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
are genes for aging,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
genes that allow them to have different lifespans.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
So if there are genes like that,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
then you can imagine that,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
if you could change one of the genes in an experiment,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
an aging gene,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And if they exist and you can find them,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
then maybe one could eventually do something about it.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
So we've set out to look for genes that control aging.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
And we didn't study any of these animals.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Instead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
And we were really optimistic that we could find something

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
because there had been a report of a long-lived mutant.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
So we started to change genes at random,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
looking for long-lived animals.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And we were very lucky to find

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.260
that mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
doubled the lifespan of the little worm.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
So you can see in black, after a month --

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
they're very short-lived; that's why we like to study them

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
for studies of aging --

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
in black, after a month, the normal worms are all dead.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
But at that time,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
most of the mutant worms are still alive.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And it isn't until twice as long

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
that they're all dead.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
So the first thing you're going to see

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
is the normal worm

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
when it's about college student age -- a young adult.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
It's quite a cute little fellow.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And next you're going to see the long-lived mutant when it's young.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
So this animal is going to live twice as long.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Is it miserable? It doesn't seem to be.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
It's active. You can't tell the difference really.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And they can be completely fertile --

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Now get out your handkerchiefs here.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
You're going to see, in just two weeks,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
the normal worms are old.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
But everything else is just lying there.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
The animal's clearly in the nursing home.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And if you look at the tissues of the animal, they're starting to deteriorate.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
You know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans --

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
which probably most of you haven't seen one --

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
you can tell they're old -- isn't that interesting?

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
So there's something about aging that's kind of universal.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And now here is the daf-2 mutant.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
One gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
It's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home;

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
it's going skiing.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
This is what's really cool: it's aging more slowly.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
It takes this worm two days

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And when I tell people about this,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.260
they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
who looks really good for being 90 or 80.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
But it's really more like this:

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s --

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and you're a bachelor and you're dating people.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And you meet someone you really like, you get to know her.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And you're in a restaurant, and you say, "Well how old are you?"

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
She says, "I'm 60."

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
That's what it's like. And you would never know.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
You would never know, until she told you.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.260
(Laughter)

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Okay.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
So what is the daf-2 gene?

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Well as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
they're instructions to make a protein that does something.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And the daf-2 gene

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
encodes a hormone receptor.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
So what you see in the picture there

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
is a cell with a hormone receptor in red

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
punching through the edge of the cell.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
So part of it is like a baseball glove.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Part of it's on the outside,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And the other part is on the inside

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
where it sends signals into the cell.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Okay, so what is the daf-2 receptor

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
telling the inside of the cell?

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well;

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
the animal lives longer.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
is to speed up aging.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
That's what that arrow means.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
speeding up aging.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
So this is altogether really, really interesting.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
It says that aging is subject to control by the genes,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and specifically by hormones.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
So what kind of hormones are these?

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
You know about a lot of them.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
These hormones are similar

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
to hormones that we have in our bodies.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
The daf-2 hormone receptor

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
is very similar to the receptor

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
for the hormone insulin and IGF-1.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Now you've all heard of at least insulin.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
into your tissues after you eat a meal.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
but our studies suggested

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about --

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
maybe they also affect aging.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
And it's looking like that's the case.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
people who worked on other kinds of animals

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
started asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
the hormone receptor mutation, in other animals,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
will they live longer?

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And that is the case in flies.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
If you change this hormone pathway in flies, they live longer.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
So it's an ancient pathway,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
such that it still works in all these animals.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And also, the common precursor also gave rise to people.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
So maybe it's working in people the same way.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And there are hints of this.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
So for example, there was one study that was done

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And just like any population,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
most of the people live to be about 70 or 80,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
but some live to be 90 or 100.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
And what they found

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
was that people who lived to 90 or 100

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
were more likely to have daf-2 mutations --

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
that is, changes in the gene

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
that encodes the receptor for IGF-1.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And these changes made the gene not act as well

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
as the normal gene would have acted.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
It damaged the gene.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
So those are hints

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
suggesting that humans are susceptible

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
to the effects of the hormones for aging.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
So the next question, of course, is:

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Is there any effect on age-related disease?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
As you age, you're much more likely

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
to get cancer, Alzheimer's disease,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
heart disease, all sorts of diseases.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
It turns out that these long-lived mutants

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
are more resistant to all these diseases.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
They hardly get cancer,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
and when they do it's not as severe.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
So it's really interesting, and it makes sense in a way,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
that they're still young,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old?

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
So it suggests

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
that, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
to replicate some of these effects in humans,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
maybe we would have a way

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
of combating lots of different age-related diseases

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
all at once.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
How could that work?

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and repair damage.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
And the way that they're switched on

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
So in a daf-2 mutant --

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
The receptor isn't working as well.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
Under those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
has gone into the nucleus --

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
that little compartment there in the middle of the cell --

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
And it's just sitting on one of them.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
So FOXO turns on a lot of genes.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
genes I call carrot-giver genes,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
whose protein products

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
actually help other proteins to function well --

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
to fold correctly and function correctly.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
and recycle them if they're damaged.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
DNA repair genes

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
are more active in these animals.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And the immune system is more active.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And many of these different genes, we've shown,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
So it's really interesting.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
These animals have within them

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
They have the ability

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
to protect themselves from many kinds of damage,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
which we think makes them live longer.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
So what about the normal worm?

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
Well when the daf-2 receptor is active,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
then it triggers a series of events

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
that prevent FOXO

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
So it can't turn the genes on.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
That's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
until we have the daf-2 mutant.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
But what good is this for the worm?

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Well we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
are hormones that are particularly active

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
under favorable conditions -- in the good times --

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
You can store the food, use it for energy,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
grow, etc.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
But what we think is that, under conditions of stress,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
the levels of these hormones drop --

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
for example, having limited food supply.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
And that, we think,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
is registered by the animal as a danger signal,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
a signal that things are not okay

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
and that it should roll out its protective capacity.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
So it activates FOXO, FOXO goes to the DNA,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and that triggers the expression of these genes

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
that improves the ability of the cell

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
to protect itself and repair itself.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
And that's why we think the animals live longer.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
So you can think of FOXO

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
as being like a building superintendent.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
So maybe he's a little bit lazy,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
but he's there, he's taking care of the building.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
But it's deteriorating.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And then suddenly, he learns that there's going to be a hurricane.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
So he doesn't actually do anything himself.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
He gets on the telephone --

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
just like FOXO gets on the DNA --

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
and he calls up

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
the roofer, the window person,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
the painter, the floor person.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
And they all come and they fortify the house.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
And then the hurricane comes through,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
And not only that, it can also just last longer,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
even if there isn't a hurricane.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
So that's the concept here

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.260
for how we think this life extension ability exists.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Now the really cool thing about FOXO

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
is that there are different forms of it.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
We all have FOXO genes,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
but we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
Just like we all have eyes,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
that have found to be more frequently present

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
in people who live to be 90 or 100.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
And that's the case all over the world,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
as you can see from these stars.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
And each one of these stars represents a population

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
where scientists have asked,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
"Okay, are there differences in the type of FOXO genes

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
among people who live a really long time?" and there are.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
We don't know the details of how this works,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
but we do know then

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
that FOXO genes can impact

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
the lifespan of people.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
And that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.260
we can increase the health and longevity of people.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
So this is really exciting to me.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round worms

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
to affect lifespan,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
and here it affects lifespan in people.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
So we've been trying in our lab now

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
to develop drugs

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
that will activate this FOXO cell

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
using human cells now

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
in order to try and come up with drugs

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
that will delay aging and age-related diseases.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And I'm really optimistic that this is going to work.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
And for at least one of them, there is a drug.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
There's one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
like the insulin pathway.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
And mutations that damage the TOR gene --

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
just like the daf-2 mutations --

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
extend lifespan in worms

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
and flies and mice.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
But in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
that binds to the TOR protein

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
and inhibits its activity.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse --

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
even when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
that old for a mouse --

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
if you give the mouse rapamycin,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
it will live longer.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
Now I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
It is a drug for people,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
but the reason is it suppresses the immune system.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.260
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
So this may not be the perfect drug

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
for staying young longer.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
But still, here in the year 2011,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
there's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
that will extend their lifespan,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
which comes out of this science

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
that's been done in all these different animals.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
So I'm really optimistic,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
and I think it won't be too long, I hope,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
before this age-old dream begins to come true.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Thank you.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:13:00.260
(Applause)

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
Matt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Let me get this straight.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
Although you're looking for a drug

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
that can solve aging

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
in old men like me,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
what you could do now pretty well in the lab,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
if you were allowed ethically,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
is start a human life from scratch

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer?

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
CK: Ah, so the kinds of drugs I was talking about

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
would not change the genes,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
they would just bind to the protein itself

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
and change its activity.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
So if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
You could change the genes in principle.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
There isn't the technology to do that.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
But I don't think that's a good idea.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
And the reason is

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
that these hormones,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
like the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
they're essential.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
If you knock them out completely, then you're very sick.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
to get the benefits without getting any problems.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
And I think that's much better,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
that kind of control would be much better as a drug.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
And also, there are other ways of activating FOXO

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
that don't even involve insulin or IGF-1

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
that might even be safer.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
MR: I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it, but ...

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
(Laughter)

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.260
There's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
which is a negligible senescence.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
There are some creatures on this planet already

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
that don't really do aging.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
Just move to one side for us, if you would.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
CK: There are. There are some animals that don't seem to age.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.260
For example, there are some tortoises called Blanding's turtles.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
And they grow to be about this size.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
And they've been tagged, and they've been found to be 70 years old.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
you can't tell the difference, just by looking,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
And the 70 year-old ones,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
actually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
and they also have more progeny every year.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
And there are other examples of these kinds of animals,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
like turns, certain kinds of birds are like this.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
And nobody knows if they really can live forever,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
or what keeps them from aging.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
It's not clear.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
If you look at birds, which live a long time,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
cells from the birds tend to be more resistant

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
to a lot of different environmental stresses

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
like high temperature

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
or hydrogen peroxide, things like that.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
And our long-lived mutants are too.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
So it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
which are set to run really quickly in the worm,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
have a different normal set point

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
in something like a bird, so that a bird can live a lot longer.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
And maybe they're even set really differently

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don't know.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
MR: But what you're talking about here

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
is not extending human lifespan

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
by preventing death,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
so much as extending human youthspan.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
CK: Yes, that's right.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
It's more like, say, if you were a dog.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
You notice that you're getting old, and you look at your human

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
and you think, "Why isn't this human getting old?"

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
It's more like that.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.260
But now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
MR: Thank you very much indeed, Cynthia Kenyon.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
(Applause)
