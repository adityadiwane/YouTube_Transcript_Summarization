00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:14.708
You may want to take a closer look.

00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:17.942
There's more to this painting than meets the eye.

00:00:17.942 --> 00:00:21.932
And yes, it's an acrylic painting of a man,

00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:24.364
but I didn't paint it on canvas.

00:00:24.364 --> 00:00:27.652
I painted it directly on top of the man.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:30.386
What I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether,

00:00:30.386 --> 00:00:32.252
and if I want to paint your portrait,

00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:35.892
I'm painting it on you, physically on you.

00:00:35.892 --> 00:00:37.645
That also means you're probably going to end up

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:39.553
with an earful of paint,

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:43.636
because I need to paint your ear on your ear.

00:00:43.636 --> 00:00:46.252
Everything in this scene, the person, the clothes,

00:00:46.252 --> 00:00:49.925
chairs, wall, gets covered in a mask of paint

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:52.686
that mimics what's directly below it,

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:56.400
and in this way, I'm able to take a three-dimensional scene

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.605
and make it look like a two-dimensional painting.

00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:01.819
I can photograph it from any angle,

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:04.842
and it will still look 2D.

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:07.855
There's no Photoshop here.

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:09.617
This is just a photo

00:01:09.617 --> 00:01:13.288
of one of my three-dimensional paintings.

00:01:13.288 --> 00:01:15.408
You might be wondering how I came up with this idea

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.672
of turning people into paintings.

00:01:17.672 --> 00:01:20.466
But originally, this had nothing to do

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.680
with either people or paint.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.072
It was about shadows.

00:01:25.072 --> 00:01:27.692
I was fascinated with the absence of light,

00:01:27.692 --> 00:01:31.143
and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality

00:01:31.143 --> 00:01:33.876
and pin it down before it changed.

00:01:33.876 --> 00:01:36.401
I came up with the idea of painting shadows.

00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:38.592
I loved that I could hide within this shadow

00:01:38.592 --> 00:01:40.696
my own painted version,

00:01:40.696 --> 00:01:43.133
and it would be almost invisible

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:45.656
until the light changed, and all of a sudden

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:48.817
my shadow would be brought to the light.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:51.880
I wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.160
and I thought of my friend Bernie.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.390
But I didn't just want to paint the shadows.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.296
I also wanted to paint the highlights

00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:02.586
and create a mapping on his body in greyscale.

00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:06.307
I had a very specific vision of what this would look like,

00:02:06.307 --> 00:02:08.480
and as I was painting him,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.999
I made sure to follow that very closely.

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.880
But something kept on flickering before my eyes.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.960
I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.566
And then when I took that moment to take a step back,

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:21.242
magic.

00:02:21.242 --> 00:02:24.952
I had turned my friend into a painting.

00:02:24.952 --> 00:02:25.940
I couldn't have foreseen that

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.495
when I wanted to paint a shadow,

00:02:28.495 --> 00:02:30.389
I would pull out this whole other dimension,

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:31.747
that I would collapse it,

00:02:31.747 --> 00:02:36.272
that I would take a painting and make it my friend

00:02:36.272 --> 00:02:39.706
and then bring him back to a painting.

00:02:39.706 --> 00:02:41.798
I was a little conflicted though,

00:02:41.798 --> 00:02:45.120
because I was so excited about what I'd found,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.424
but I was just about to graduate from college

00:02:47.424 --> 00:02:49.200
with a degree in political science,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.734
and I'd always had this dream

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:53.960
of going to Washington, D.C.,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.202
and sitting at a desk

00:02:56.202 --> 00:02:58.920
and working in government.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.968
(Laughter)

00:03:00.968 --> 00:03:04.168
Why did this have to get in the way of all that?

00:03:04.168 --> 00:03:05.746
I made the tough decision

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:09.158
of going home after graduation

00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:12.258
and not going up to Capitol Hill,

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.400
but going down to my parents' basement

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.870
and making it my job to learn how to paint.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.182
I had no idea where to begin.

00:03:21.182 --> 00:03:22.727
The last time I'd painted,

00:03:22.727 --> 00:03:25.166
I was 16 years old at summer camp,

00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:27.614
and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint

00:03:27.614 --> 00:03:29.853
by copying the old masters

00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:31.199
or stretching a canvas

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.576
and practicing over and over again on that surface,

00:03:34.576 --> 00:03:37.380
because that's not what this project was about for me.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.482
It was about space and light.

00:03:40.482 --> 00:03:43.325
My early canvases ended up being

00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:46.602
things that you wouldn't expect to be used as canvas,

00:03:46.602 --> 00:03:48.760
like fried food.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.884
It's nearly impossible

00:03:50.884 --> 00:03:53.670
to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.746
(Laughter)

00:03:55.746 --> 00:03:58.228
Even harder was getting paint to stick

00:03:58.228 --> 00:04:00.494
to the acid in a grapefruit.

00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:03.606
It just would erase my brush strokes

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:05.037
like invisible ink.

00:04:05.037 --> 00:04:08.681
I'd put something down, and instantly it would be gone.

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.783
And if I wanted to paint on people,

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:13.519
well, I was a little bit embarrassed

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.327
to bring people down into my studio

00:04:15.327 --> 00:04:18.387
and show them that I spent my days in a basement

00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:21.523
putting paint on toast.

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:23.382
It just seemed like it made more sense

00:04:23.382 --> 00:04:26.611
to practice by painting on myself.

00:04:26.611 --> 00:04:29.537
One of my favorite models actually ended up being

00:04:29.537 --> 00:04:31.321
a retired old man

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:33.600
who not only didn't mind sitting still

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.149
and getting the paint in his ears,

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:38.798
but he also didn't really have much embarrassment

00:04:38.798 --> 00:04:40.789
about being taken out into very public places

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.401
for exhibition,

00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:45.720
like the Metro.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.447
I was having so much fun with this process.

00:04:49.447 --> 00:04:53.691
I was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles,

00:04:53.691 --> 00:04:56.856
and I wanted to see what else I could do with it.

00:04:56.856 --> 00:04:59.813
I came together with a collaborator, Sheila Vand,

00:04:59.813 --> 00:05:02.121
and we had the idea of creating paintings

00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:04.838
in a more unusual surface,

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:07.795
and that was milk.

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:10.214
We got a pool. We filled it with milk.

00:05:10.214 --> 00:05:13.190
We filled it with Sheila. And I began painting.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.199
And the images were always

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.383
completely unexpected in the end,

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:20.127
because I could have a very specific image

00:05:20.127 --> 00:05:21.450
about how it would turn out,

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.706
I could paint it to match that,

00:05:23.706 --> 00:05:26.272
but the moment that Sheila laid back into the milk,

00:05:26.272 --> 00:05:28.118
everything would change.

00:05:28.118 --> 00:05:30.134
It was in constant flux,

00:05:30.134 --> 00:05:33.401
and we had to, rather than fight it, embrace it,

00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:34.645
see where the milk would take us

00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:38.789
and compensate to make it even better.

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.047
Sometimes, when Sheila would lay down in the milk,

00:05:42.047 --> 00:05:44.641
it would wash all the paint off of her arms,

00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:47.795
and it might seem a little bit clumsy,

00:05:47.795 --> 00:05:50.865
but our solution would be, okay, hide your arms.

00:05:50.865 --> 00:05:53.923
And one time, she got so much milk in her hair

00:05:53.923 --> 00:05:56.801
that it just smeared all the paint off of her face.

00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:59.076
All right, well, hide your face.

00:05:59.076 --> 00:06:02.487
And we ended up with something far more elegant

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.332
than we could have imagined,

00:06:04.332 --> 00:06:06.547
even though this is essentially the same solution

00:06:06.547 --> 00:06:09.918
that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands,

00:06:09.918 --> 00:06:13.075
just hiding them in the pockets.

00:06:13.075 --> 00:06:15.609
When we started out on the milk project,

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:17.139
and when I started out,

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.043
I couldn't have foreseen that I would go

00:06:20.043 --> 00:06:22.444
from pursuing my dream in politics

00:06:22.444 --> 00:06:24.145
and working at a desk

00:06:24.145 --> 00:06:25.911
to tripping over a shadow

00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:28.979
and then turning people into paintings

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.259
and painting on people in a pool of milk.

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.667
But then again, I guess it's also not unforeseeable

00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:38.691
that you can find the strange in the familiar,

00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:40.196
as long as you're willing to look beyond

00:06:40.196 --> 00:06:41.767
what's already been brought to light,

00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:44.014
that you can see what's below the surface,

00:06:44.014 --> 00:06:46.005
hiding in the shadows,

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:48.699
and recognize that there can be more there

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.571
than meets the eye.

00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:51.944
Thank you.

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:57.283
(Applause)
