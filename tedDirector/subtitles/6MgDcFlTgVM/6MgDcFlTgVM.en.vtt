00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.199
Well, I'm an ocean chemist.

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:16.342
I look at the chemistry
of the ocean today.

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:19.366
I look at the chemistry
of the ocean in the past.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.454
The way I look back in the past

00:00:21.478 --> 00:00:24.629
is by using the fossilized remains
of deepwater corals.

00:00:24.653 --> 00:00:27.295
You can see an image of one
of these corals behind me.

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:31.745
It was collected from close to Antarctica,
thousands of meters below the sea,

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.857
so, very different
than the kinds of corals

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:37.668
you may have been lucky enough to see
if you've had a tropical holiday.

00:00:37.692 --> 00:00:39.748
So I'm hoping that this talk will give you

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.565
a four-dimensional view of the ocean.

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.462
Two dimensions, such as this
beautiful two-dimensional image

00:00:45.486 --> 00:00:47.080
of the sea surface temperature.

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:51.128
This was taken using satellite,
so it's got tremendous spatial resolution.

00:00:51.898 --> 00:00:54.764
The overall features are extremely
easy to understand.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:58.452
The equatorial regions are warm
because there's more sunlight.

00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:01.162
The polar regions are cold
because there's less sunlight.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:04.107
And that allows big icecaps
to build up on Antarctica

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:05.941
and up in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.717
If you plunge deep into the sea,
or even put your toes in the sea,

00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:11.684
you know it gets colder as you go down,

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:15.687
and that's mostly because the deep waters
that fill the abyss of the ocean

00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:18.876
come from the cold polar regions
where the waters are dense.

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:22.951
If we travel back in time
20,000 years ago,

00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:24.835
the earth looked very much different.

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.326
And I've just given you a cartoon version
of one of the major differences

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.605
you would have seen
if you went back that long.

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:32.311
The icecaps were much bigger.

00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:35.962
They covered lots of the continent,
and they extended out over the ocean.

00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:38.479
Sea level was 120 meters lower.

00:01:38.503 --> 00:01:42.047
Carbon dioxide [levels] were very
much lower than they are today.

00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:45.715
So the earth was probably about three
to five degrees colder overall,

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.559
and much, much colder
in the polar regions.

00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:51.362
What I'm trying to understand,

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:54.188
and what other colleagues of mine
are trying to understand,

00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:56.671
is how we moved from that
cold climate condition

00:01:56.695 --> 00:01:59.591
to the warm climate condition
that we enjoy today.

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:01.674
We know from ice core research

00:02:01.698 --> 00:02:04.778
that the transition from these
cold conditions to warm conditions

00:02:04.802 --> 00:02:09.550
wasn't smooth, as you might predict
from the slow increase in solar radiation.

00:02:10.153 --> 00:02:13.384
And we know this from ice cores,
because if you drill down into ice,

00:02:13.408 --> 00:02:16.679
you find annual bands of ice,
and you can see this in the iceberg.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.694
You can see those blue-white layers.

00:02:18.718 --> 00:02:22.344
Gases are trapped in the ice cores,
so we can measure CO2 --

00:02:22.368 --> 00:02:24.733
that's why we know CO2
was lower in the past --

00:02:24.757 --> 00:02:27.750
and the chemistry of the ice
also tells us about temperature

00:02:27.774 --> 00:02:29.249
in the polar regions.

00:02:29.273 --> 00:02:32.952
And if you move in time
from 20,000 years ago to the modern day,

00:02:32.976 --> 00:02:34.785
you see that temperature increased.

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:36.434
It didn't increase smoothly.

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:38.236
Sometimes it increased very rapidly,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.504
then there was a plateau,

00:02:39.528 --> 00:02:40.793
then it increased rapidly.

00:02:40.817 --> 00:02:42.841
It was different in the two polar regions,

00:02:42.865 --> 00:02:45.594
and CO2 also increased in jumps.

00:02:46.808 --> 00:02:49.854
So we're pretty sure the ocean
has a lot to do with this.

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.244
The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon,

00:02:52.268 --> 00:02:54.822
about 60 times more
than is in the atmosphere.

00:02:54.846 --> 00:02:58.048
It also acts to transport heat
across the equator,

00:02:58.072 --> 00:03:01.841
and the ocean is full of nutrients
and it controls primary productivity.

00:03:02.142 --> 00:03:05.126
So if we want to find out
what's going on down in the deep sea,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.743
we really need to get down there,

00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:07.933
see what's there

00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:09.361
and start to explore.

00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:12.392
This is some spectacular footage
coming from a seamount

00:03:12.416 --> 00:03:14.605
about a kilometer deep
in international waters

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.609
in the equatorial Atlantic, far from land.

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:20.682
You're amongst the first people
to see this bit of the seafloor,

00:03:20.706 --> 00:03:22.348
along with my research team.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.084
You're probably seeing new species.

00:03:25.108 --> 00:03:26.260
We don't know.

00:03:26.284 --> 00:03:29.944
You'd have to collect the samples
and do some very intense taxonomy.

00:03:29.968 --> 00:03:31.861
You can see beautiful bubblegum corals.

00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:34.139
There are brittle stars
growing on these corals.

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:37.219
Those are things that look
like tentacles coming out of corals.

00:03:37.243 --> 00:03:40.115
There are corals made of different forms
of calcium carbonate

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.515
growing off the basalt of this
massive undersea mountain,

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.903
and the dark sort of stuff,
those are fossilized corals,

00:03:46.927 --> 00:03:49.238
and we're going to talk
a little more about those

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.610
as we travel back in time.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.515
To do that, we need
to charter a research boat.

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.579
This is the James Cook,
an ocean-class research vessel

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:57.873
moored up in Tenerife.

00:03:57.897 --> 00:03:59.229
Looks beautiful, right?

00:03:59.554 --> 00:04:01.384
Great, if you're not a great mariner.

00:04:01.702 --> 00:04:04.206
Sometimes it looks
a little more like this.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.429
This is us trying to make sure
that we don't lose precious samples.

00:04:07.453 --> 00:04:10.270
Everyone's scurrying around,
and I get terribly seasick,

00:04:10.294 --> 00:04:13.288
so it's not always a lot of fun,
but overall it is.

00:04:13.312 --> 00:04:15.898
So we've got to become
a really good mapper to do this.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.661
You don't see that kind of spectacular
coral abundance everywhere.

00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:22.725
It is global and it is deep,

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.063
but we need to really find
the right places.

00:04:25.087 --> 00:04:28.253
We just saw a global map,
and overlaid was our cruise passage

00:04:28.277 --> 00:04:29.482
from last year.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.386
This was a seven-week cruise,

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.434
and this is us, having made our own maps

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:37.529
of about 75,000 square kilometers
of the seafloor in seven weeks,

00:04:37.553 --> 00:04:40.075
but that's only a tiny fraction
of the seafloor.

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:41.868
We're traveling from west to east,

00:04:41.892 --> 00:04:45.392
over part of the ocean that would
look featureless on a big-scale map,

00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:48.673
but actually some of these mountains
are as big as Everest.

00:04:48.697 --> 00:04:50.626
So with the maps that we make on board,

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.642
we get about 100-meter resolution,

00:04:52.666 --> 00:04:55.555
enough to pick out areas
to deploy our equipment,

00:04:55.579 --> 00:04:57.493
but not enough to see very much.

00:04:57.517 --> 00:05:00.239
To do that, we need to fly
remotely-operated vehicles

00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:02.477
about five meters off the seafloor.

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.716
And if we do that, we can get maps
that are one-meter resolution

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.834
down thousands of meters.

00:05:07.858 --> 00:05:09.675
Here is a remotely-operated vehicle,

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.010
a research-grade vehicle.

00:05:12.034 --> 00:05:14.516
You can see an array
of big lights on the top.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.595
There are high-definition cameras,
manipulator arms,

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:20.532
and lots of little boxes and things
to put your samples.

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:24.805
Here we are on our first dive
of this particular cruise,

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:26.535
plunging down into the ocean.

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.432
We go pretty fast to make sure
the remotely operated vehicles

00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:31.179
are not affected by any other ships.

00:05:31.203 --> 00:05:32.401
And we go down,

00:05:32.425 --> 00:05:34.599
and these are the kinds of things you see.

00:05:34.623 --> 00:05:38.123
These are deep sea sponges, meter scale.

00:05:38.817 --> 00:05:43.065
This is a swimming holothurian --
it's a small sea slug, basically.

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:44.276
This is slowed down.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.689
Most of the footage I'm showing
you is speeded up,

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:48.641
because all of this takes a lot of time.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:52.413
This is a beautiful holothurian as well.

00:05:52.897 --> 00:05:55.969
And this animal you're going to see
coming up was a big surprise.

00:05:55.993 --> 00:05:59.405
I've never seen anything like this
and it took us all a bit surprised.

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:03.017
This was after about 15 hours of work
and we were all a bit trigger-happy,

00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:05.778
and suddenly this giant
sea monster started rolling past.

00:06:05.802 --> 00:06:08.908
It's called a pyrosome
or colonial tunicate, if you like.

00:06:08.932 --> 00:06:10.719
This wasn't what we were looking for.

00:06:10.743 --> 00:06:13.389
We were looking for corals,
deep sea corals.

00:06:14.194 --> 00:06:16.492
You're going to see a picture
of one in a moment.

00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:19.151
It's small, about five centimeters high.

00:06:19.175 --> 00:06:22.493
It's made of calcium carbonate,
so you can see its tentacles there,

00:06:22.517 --> 00:06:24.648
moving in the ocean currents.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.291
An organism like this probably lives
for about a hundred years.

00:06:28.315 --> 00:06:31.855
And as it grows, it takes in
chemicals from the ocean.

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.085
And the chemicals,
or the amount of chemicals,

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:36.783
depends on the temperature;
it depends on the pH,

00:06:36.807 --> 00:06:38.353
it depends on the nutrients.

00:06:38.377 --> 00:06:41.611
And if we can understand how
these chemicals get into the skeleton,

00:06:41.635 --> 00:06:44.133
we can then go back,
collect fossil specimens,

00:06:44.157 --> 00:06:47.301
and reconstruct what the ocean
used to look like in the past.

00:06:47.325 --> 00:06:50.761
And here you can see us collecting
that coral with a vacuum system,

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:53.386
and we put it into a sampling container.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.469
We can do this very
carefully, I should add.

00:06:55.493 --> 00:06:57.878
Some of these organisms live even longer.

00:06:57.902 --> 00:07:01.304
This is a black coral called Leiopathes,
an image taken by my colleague,

00:07:01.328 --> 00:07:04.590
Brendan Roark, about 500
meters below Hawaii.

00:07:04.614 --> 00:07:06.657
Four thousand years is a long time.

00:07:06.962 --> 00:07:10.097
If you take a branch from one
of these corals and polish it up,

00:07:10.121 --> 00:07:12.414
this is about 100 microns across.

00:07:12.763 --> 00:07:15.254
And Brendan took some analyses
across this coral --

00:07:15.278 --> 00:07:17.084
you can see the marks --

00:07:17.108 --> 00:07:20.067
and he's been able to show
that these are actual annual bands,

00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:22.004
so even at 500 meters deep in the ocean,

00:07:22.028 --> 00:07:24.796
corals can record seasonal changes,

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.552
which is pretty spectacular.

00:07:26.576 --> 00:07:30.374
But 4,000 years is not enough to get
us back to our last glacial maximum.

00:07:30.398 --> 00:07:31.556
So what do we do?

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.587
We go in for these fossil specimens.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.111
This is what makes me really unpopular
with my research team.

00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:38.285
So going along,

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:39.927
there's giant sharks everywhere,

00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:42.449
there are pyrosomes,
there are swimming holothurians,

00:07:42.473 --> 00:07:43.744
there's giant sponges,

00:07:43.768 --> 00:07:46.363
but I make everyone go down
to these dead fossil areas

00:07:46.387 --> 00:07:49.943
and spend ages kind of shoveling
around on the seafloor.

00:07:49.967 --> 00:07:53.332
And we pick up all these corals,
bring them back, we sort them out.

00:07:53.356 --> 00:07:55.651
But each one of these is a different age,

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:57.576
and if we can find out how old they are

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.112
and then we can measure
those chemical signals,

00:08:00.136 --> 00:08:01.558
this helps us to find out

00:08:01.582 --> 00:08:04.065
what's been going on
in the ocean in the past.

00:08:04.558 --> 00:08:06.262
So on the left-hand image here,

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:09.318
I've taken a slice through a coral,
polished it very carefully

00:08:09.342 --> 00:08:11.312
and taken an optical image.

00:08:11.336 --> 00:08:12.488
On the right-hand side,

00:08:12.512 --> 00:08:15.612
we've taken that same piece of coral,
put it in a nuclear reactor,

00:08:15.636 --> 00:08:16.788
induced fission,

00:08:16.812 --> 00:08:18.443
and every time there's some decay,

00:08:18.467 --> 00:08:20.449
you can see that marked out in the coral,

00:08:20.473 --> 00:08:22.362
so we can see the uranium distribution.

00:08:22.386 --> 00:08:23.537
Why are we doing this?

00:08:23.561 --> 00:08:25.848
Uranium is a very poorly regarded element,

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.031
but I love it.

00:08:27.055 --> 00:08:30.267
The decay helps us find out
about the rates and dates

00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:31.830
of what's going on in the ocean.

00:08:31.854 --> 00:08:33.752
And if you remember from the beginning,

00:08:33.776 --> 00:08:36.789
that's what we want to get at
when we're thinking about climate.

00:08:36.813 --> 00:08:38.564
So we use a laser to analyze uranium

00:08:38.588 --> 00:08:41.373
and one of its daughter products,
thorium, in these corals,

00:08:41.397 --> 00:08:44.036
and that tells us exactly
how old the fossils are.

00:08:44.742 --> 00:08:46.934
This beautiful animation
of the Southern Ocean

00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.093
I'm just going to use illustrate
how we're using these corals

00:08:50.117 --> 00:08:54.188
to get at some of the ancient
ocean feedbacks.

00:08:54.212 --> 00:08:56.638
You can see the density
of the surface water

00:08:56.662 --> 00:08:59.060
in this animation by Ryan Abernathey.

00:08:59.481 --> 00:09:01.518
It's just one year of data,

00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:04.152
but you can see how dynamic
the Southern Ocean is.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.907
The intense mixing,
particularly the Drake Passage,

00:09:07.931 --> 00:09:10.368
which is shown by the box,

00:09:10.392 --> 00:09:13.004
is really one of the strongest
currents in the world

00:09:13.028 --> 00:09:15.235
coming through here,
flowing from west to east.

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:16.608
It's very turbulently mixed,

00:09:16.632 --> 00:09:19.504
because it's moving over those
great big undersea mountains,

00:09:19.528 --> 00:09:24.009
and this allows CO2 and heat to exchange
with the atmosphere in and out.

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:27.540
And essentially, the oceans are breathing
through the Southern Ocean.

00:09:28.865 --> 00:09:34.329
We've collected corals from back and forth
across this Antarctic passage,

00:09:34.353 --> 00:09:37.380
and we've found quite a surprising thing
from my uranium dating:

00:09:37.404 --> 00:09:39.907
the corals migrated from south to north

00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:43.060
during this transition from the glacial
to the interglacial.

00:09:43.084 --> 00:09:44.291
We don't really know why,

00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:46.864
but we think it's something
to do with the food source

00:09:46.888 --> 00:09:48.845
and maybe the oxygen in the water.

00:09:49.718 --> 00:09:50.873
So here we are.

00:09:50.897 --> 00:09:53.945
I'm going to illustrate what I think
we've found about climate

00:09:53.969 --> 00:09:55.929
from those corals in the Southern Ocean.

00:09:55.953 --> 00:09:59.228
We went up and down sea mountains.
We collected little fossil corals.

00:09:59.252 --> 00:10:00.778
This is my illustration of that.

00:10:00.802 --> 00:10:02.207
We think back in the glacial,

00:10:02.231 --> 00:10:04.254
from the analysis
we've made in the corals,

00:10:04.278 --> 00:10:07.364
that the deep part of the Southern Ocean
was very rich in carbon,

00:10:07.388 --> 00:10:10.077
and there was a low-density
layer sitting on top.

00:10:10.101 --> 00:10:12.894
That stops carbon dioxide
coming out of the ocean.

00:10:13.752 --> 00:10:16.344
We then found corals
that are of an intermediate age,

00:10:16.368 --> 00:10:20.948
and they show us that the ocean mixed
partway through that climate transition.

00:10:20.972 --> 00:10:23.439
That allows carbon to come
out of the deep ocean.

00:10:24.154 --> 00:10:27.253
And then if we analyze corals
closer to the modern day,

00:10:27.277 --> 00:10:29.531
or indeed if we go down there today anyway

00:10:29.555 --> 00:10:31.761
and measure the chemistry of the corals,

00:10:31.785 --> 00:10:35.779
we see that we move to a position
where carbon can exchange in and out.

00:10:35.803 --> 00:10:37.877
So this is the way
we can use fossil corals

00:10:37.901 --> 00:10:39.843
to help us learn about the environment.

00:10:41.827 --> 00:10:43.961
So I want to leave you
with this last slide.

00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:47.908
It's just a still taken out of that first
piece of footage that I showed you.

00:10:47.932 --> 00:10:50.044
This is a spectacular coral garden.

00:10:50.068 --> 00:10:52.626
We didn't even expect
to find things this beautiful.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.534
It's thousands of meters deep.

00:10:54.558 --> 00:10:55.932
There are new species.

00:10:56.416 --> 00:10:58.315
It's just a beautiful place.

00:10:58.339 --> 00:10:59.720
There are fossils in amongst,

00:10:59.744 --> 00:11:02.435
and now I've trained you
to appreciate the fossil corals

00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:03.674
that are down there.

00:11:03.698 --> 00:11:06.564
So next time you're lucky enough
to fly over the ocean

00:11:06.588 --> 00:11:07.997
or sail over the ocean,

00:11:08.021 --> 00:11:10.688
just think -- there are massive
sea mountains down there

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:12.579
that nobody's ever seen before,

00:11:12.603 --> 00:11:14.220
and there are beautiful corals.

00:11:14.244 --> 00:11:15.395
Thank you.

00:11:15.419 --> 00:11:20.349
(Applause)
