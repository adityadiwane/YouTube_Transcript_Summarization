00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
This is actually a painting

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
In the front, you see, actually, Joe Murray

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
getting the patient ready for the transplant,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
the Chief of Urology at Harvard,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
actually harvesting the kidney.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
The kidney was indeed the first organ

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
ever to be transplanted to the human.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
That was back in 1954,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
55 years ago.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
Yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
as many decades ago.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Certainly many advances, many lives saved.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
But we have a major shortage of organs.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
In the last decade the number of patients

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
waiting for a transplant has doubled.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
While, at the same time, the actual number of transplants

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
has remained almost entirely flat.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
That really has to do with our aging population.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
We're just getting older.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Medicine is doing a better job

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
of keeping us alive.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
But as we age, our organs tend to fail more.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
So, that's a challenge,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
not just for organs but also for tissues.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Trying to replace pancreas,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.260
trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
These are major issues.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.260
This is actually a very stunning statistic.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Every 30 seconds

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
a patient dies from diseases

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.260
that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
So, what can we do about it?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
We've talked about stem cells tonight.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
That's a way to do it.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.260
But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
in terms of actual therapies for organs.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Wouldn't it be great if our bodies could regenerate?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.260
of our bodies, to actually heal ourselves?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
It's not really that foreign of a concept, actually;

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.260
it happens on the Earth every day.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
This is actually a picture of a salamander.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
You see here a little video.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.260
This is actually a limb injury in this salamander.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And this is actually real photography,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
timed photography, showing how that limb regenerates

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
in a period of days.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
You see the scar form.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And that scar actually grows out

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
a new limb.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
So, salamanders can do it.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Why can't we? Why can't humans regenerate?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Actually, we can regenerate.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
Your body has many organs

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and every single organ in your body

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
has a cell population

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.260
that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
As you age, as you get older.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Your bones regenerate every 10 years.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Your skin regenerates every two weeks.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
So, your body is constantly regenerating.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
The challenge occurs when there is an injury.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
At the time of injury or disease,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
the body's first reaction

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
is to seal itself off from the rest of the body.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
It basically wants to fight off infection,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and seal itself, whether it's organs inside your body,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
or your skin, the first reaction

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
is for scar tissue to move in,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.260
to seal itself off from the outside.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
So, how can we harness that power?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
One of the ways that we do that

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.260
is actually by using smart biomaterials.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
How does this work? Well, on the left side here

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
you see a urethra which was injured.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.260
This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And you see that it is injured.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.260
We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
that you can actually use as a bridge.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
If you build that bridge, and you close off

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
from the outside environment,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
then you can create that bridge, and cells

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
that regenerate in your body,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.260
can then cross that bridge, and take that path.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
That's exactly what you see here.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
It's actually a smart biomaterial

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
that we used, to actually treat this patient.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
This was an injured urethra on the left side.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
We used that biomaterial in the middle.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And then, six months later on the right-hand side

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
you see this reengineered urethra.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Turns out your body can regenerate,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
but only for small distances.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
The maximum efficient distance for regeneration

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
is only about one centimeter.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
So, we can use these smart biomaterials

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
but only for about one centimeter

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
to bridge those gaps.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
So, we do regenerate, but for limited distances.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
What do we do now,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
if you have injury for larger organs?

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
What do we do when we have injuries

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
for structures which are much larger

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
than one centimeter?

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Then we can start to use cells.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
The strategy here, is if a patient comes in to us

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
with a diseased or injured organ,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
less than half the size of a postage stamp,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
you can then tease that tissue apart,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
and look at its basic components,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
the patient's own cells,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
you take those cells out,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.260
grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
and then we then use scaffold materials.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
or your shirt, but actually

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
these materials are fairly complex

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
and they are designed to degrade once inside the body.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
It disintegrates a few months later.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
It's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
It's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
the cells to regenerate new tissue,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.260
and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
And that's what we did for this piece of muscle.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
the structures to actually engineer the muscle.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
We take the cells, we expand them,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
we place the cells on the scaffold,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and we then place the scaffold back into the patient.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
But actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
we actually exercise it.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
We want to make sure that we condition

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
this muscle, so that it knows what to do

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
once we put it into the patient.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
That's what you're seeing here. You're seeing

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
this muscle bio-reactor

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.260
actually exercising the muscle back and forth.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.260
Okay. These are flat structures that we see here,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
the muscle.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
What about other structures?

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
This is actually an engineered blood vessel.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Very similar to what we just did, but a little bit more complex.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Here we take a scaffold,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.260
and we basically -- scaffold can be like a piece of paper here.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
And we can then tubularize this scaffold.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.260
And what we do is we, to make a blood vessel, same strategy.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.260
A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
We take muscle cells, we paste,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
or coat the outside with these muscle cells,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
very much like baking a layer cake, if you will.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
You place the muscle cells on the outside.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.260
You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
You now have your fully seeded scaffold.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
You're going to place this in an oven-like device.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
It has the same conditions as a human body,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
37 degrees centigrade,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
95 percent oxygen.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.260
You then exercise it, as what you saw on that tape.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
And this is an X-ray showing you

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
the patent, functional blood vessel.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
More complex structures

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
such as blood vessels, urethras, which I showed you,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
they're definitely more complex

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
because you're introducing two different cell types.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
But they are really acting mostly as conduits.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
You're allowing fluid or air to go through

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
at steady states.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
because you're asking these organs to act on demand.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
So, the bladder is one such organ.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Same strategy, we take a very small piece of the bladder,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
less than half the size of a postage stamp.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
We then tease the tissue apart

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
into its two individual cell components,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
muscle, and these bladder specialized cells.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.260
We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
We coat the outside with these muscle cells.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
We place it back into this oven-like device.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
From the time you take that piece of tissue, six to eight weeks later

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
you can put the organ right back into the patient.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
This actually shows the scaffold.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.260
The material is actually being coated with the cells.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
When we did the first clinical trial for these patients

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
We brought patients in,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery, did X-rays,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
pelvic cavity.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
For the second phase of the trials

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
we just had different sizes, small, medium, large and extra-large.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
(Laughter)

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
It's true.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
And I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra-large. Right?

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
(Laughter)

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
So, bladders are definitely a little bit more complex

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
than the other structures.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
This is actually a heart valve, which we engineered.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
We take the scaffold, we seed it with cells,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.260
and you can now see here, the valve leaflets opening and closing.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
We exercise these prior to implantation.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Same strategy.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
And then the most complex are the solid organs.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
For solid organs, they're more complex

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.260
because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
It's now being seeded with cartilage.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
That's the oven-like device;

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
once it's coated it gets placed there.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:26.260
And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
This is actually digits that we're engineering.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
These are being layered, one layer at a time,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
first the bone, we fill in the gaps with cartilage.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
We then start adding the muscle on top.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And you start layering these solid structures.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Again, fairly more complex organs,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
but by far, the most complex solid organs

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.260
are actually the vascularized, highly vascularized,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
a lot of blood vessel supply,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
organs such as the heart,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
the liver, the kidneys.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
This is actually an example -- several strategies

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
to engineer solid organs.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
This is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And instead of using ink, we use -- you just saw an inkjet cartridge --

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
we just use cells.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
This is actually your typical desktop printer.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
It's actually printing this two chamber heart,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
one layer at a time.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.260
You see the heart coming out there. It takes about 40 minutes to print,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
and about four to six hours later

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
you see the muscle cells contract.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:30.260
(Applause)

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.260
This technology was developed by Tao Ju, who worked at our institute.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
And this is actually still, of course, experimental,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
not for use in patients.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
Another strategy that we have followed

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
is actually to use decellularized organs.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
We actually take donor organs,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
organs that are discarded,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
and we then can use very mild detergents

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
to take all the cell elements out of these organs.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
So, for example on the left panel,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
top panel, you see a liver.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
We actually take the donor liver,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
we use very mild detergents,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.260
and we, by using these mild detergents, we take all the cells

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
out of the liver.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
Two weeks later, we basically can lift this organ up,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
it feels like a liver,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
we can hold it like a liver,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
it looks like a liver, but it has no cells.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
All we are left with

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
is the skeleton, if you will, of the liver,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
all made up of collagen,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
a material that's in our bodies, that will not reject.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
We can use it from one patient to the next.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
We then take this vascular structure

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.260
and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
You can see, actually that's a fluoroscopy.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
We're actually injecting contrast into the organ.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.260
Now you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
into this decellularized liver.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
We then take the cells, the vascular cells,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
blood vessel cells, we perfuse the vascular tree

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
with the patient's own cells.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
We perfuse the outside of the liver

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
with the patient's own liver cells.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
And we can then create functional livers.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
And that's actually what you're seeing.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.260
This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
of the liver structure, experimentally.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
For the kidney,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.260
as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
the first slide I showed you,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
are waiting for a kidney, 90 percent.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
So, another strategy we're following

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
is actually to create wafers

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.260
that we stack together, like an accordion, if you will.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
So, we stack these wafers together, using the kidney cells.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
They are actually making urine.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.260
Again, small structures, our challenge is how to make them larger,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
and that is something we're working on

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
right now at the institute.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.260
is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
If at all possible,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
we really would like to use smart biomaterials

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
that we can just take off the shelf

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and regenerate your organs.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
We are limited with distances right now,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.260
but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
If we cannot use smart biomaterials,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
then we'd rather use your very own cells.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
Why? Because they will not reject.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
We can take cells from you,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
create the structure, put it right back into you, they will not reject.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.260
And if possible, we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
If you present with a diseased wind pipe

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
we'd like to take cells from your windpipe.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
If you present with a diseased pancreas

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
we'd like to take cells from that organ.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
Why? Because we'd rather take those cells

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
which already know that those are the cell types you want.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
We don't need to teach it to become another cell type.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
So, we prefer organ-specific cells.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
except for several which we still need stem cells for,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.260
like heart, liver, nerve and pancreas.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
And for those we still need stem cells.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
If we cannot use stem cells from your body

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
then we'd like to use donor stem cells.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
And we prefer cells that will not reject

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
and will not form tumors.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
published on two years ago,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
stem cells from the amniotic fluid,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.260
and the placenta, which have those properties.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
So, at this point, I do want to tell you that

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.260
some of the major challenges we have.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
You know, I just showed you this presentation, everything looks so good,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
everything works. Actually no,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
these technologies really are not that easy.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
Some of the work you saw today

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
was performed by over 700 researchers

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
at our institute across a 20-year time span.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
So, these are very tough technologies.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
Once you get the formula right you can replicate it.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
But it takes a lot to get there.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
So, I always like to show this cartoon.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
This is how to stop a runaway stage.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
And there you see the stagecoach driver,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and he goes, on the top panel,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
He goes A, B, C, D, E, F.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
He finally stops the runaway stage.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
And those are usually the basic scientists,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
The bottom is usually the surgeons.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.260
(Laughter)

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
I'm a surgeon so that's not that funny.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.260
(Laughter)

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.260
But actually method A is the correct approach.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
to the clinic,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
in the laboratory before we ever

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
launch these technologies to patients.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
And when we launch these technologies to patients

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.260
we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
Are you ready to place this in your own loved one, your own child,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
your own family member, and then we proceed.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
Because our main goal, of course,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
is first, to do no harm.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
I'm going to show you now, a very short clip,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
It's a five second clip of a patient

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
who received one of the engineered organs.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
We started implanting some of these structures

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
over 14 years ago.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
So, we have patients now walking around with organs,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.260
engineered organs, for over 10 years, as well.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
I'm going to show a clip of one young lady.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
She had a spina bifida defect, a spinal cord abnormality.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
She did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
We are just taking five seconds.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:19.260
This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
Video: Kaitlyn M: I'm happy. I was always afraid

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
that I was going to have like, an accident or something.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
And now I can just go and

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
go out with my friends,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
go do whatever I want.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
Anthony Atala: See, at the end of the day, the promise of regenerative medicine

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
is a single promise.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
And that is really very simple,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
to make our patients better.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
Thank you for your attention.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
(Applause)
