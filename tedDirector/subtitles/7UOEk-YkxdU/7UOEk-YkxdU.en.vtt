00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
My travels to Afghanistan

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
began many, many years ago

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
on the eastern border of my country,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
my homeland, Poland.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I was walking through the forests

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.260
of my grandmother's tales.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.260
A land where every field hides a grave,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
where millions of people

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
have been deported or killed

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
in the 20th century.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Behind the destruction,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
I found a soul of places.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
I met humble people.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
I heard their prayer

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and ate their bread.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.260
Then I have been walking East for 20 years --

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
from Eastern Europe to Central Asia --

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
through the Caucasus Mountains,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Middle East,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
North Africa,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Russia.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And I ever met more humble people.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
And I shared their bread and their prayer.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
This is why I went to Afghanistan.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.260
One day, I crossed the bridge

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
over the Oxus River.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
I was alone on foot.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
that he forgot to stamp my passport.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
But he gave me a cup of tea.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And I understood

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
that his surprise was my protection.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So I have been walking and traveling,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
from Iran's border

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.260
to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And in this way

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:05.260
I could find noor, the hidden light of Afghanistan.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
My only weapon

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.260
was my notebook and my Leica.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
I heard prayers of the Sufi --

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
humble Muslims,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
hated by the Taliban.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Hidden river,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
interconnected with the mysticism

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
from Gibraltar to India.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.260
The mosque where the respectful foreigner

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
is showered with blessings

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
and with tears,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and welcomed as a gift.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
What do we know

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
about the country and the people

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
that we pretend to protect,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
about the villages

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
where the only one medicine

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
to kill the pain and to stop the hunger

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
is opium?

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
These are opium-addicted people

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
on the roofs of Kabul

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.260
10 years after the beginning of our war.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
These are the nomad girls

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
What do we know about the women

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
10 years after the war?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Clothed in this nylon bag,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
made in China,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.260
with the name of burqa.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
I saw one day,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
the largest school in Afghanistan,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
a girls' school.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
13,000 girls

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.260
studying here

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
in the rooms underground,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
full of scorpions.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And their love [for studying]

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.260
was so big that I cried.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
What do we know

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
about the death threats by the Taliban

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
nailed on the doors

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.260
of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh?

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
The region is not secure, but full of the Taliban,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and they did it.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
My aim is to give a voice

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
to the silent people,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.260
to show the hidden lights

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
behind the curtain of the great game,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
the small worlds ignored by the media

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
and the prophets of a global conflict.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Thanks.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:38.260
(Applause)
