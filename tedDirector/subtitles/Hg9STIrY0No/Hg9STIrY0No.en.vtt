00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:17.650
Mother Earth: Our end was imminent

00:00:17.674 --> 00:00:19.989
yet finality relented.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.473
Wind, water and fire gently revived;

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:27.876
you and I reconciled,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.956
rhythms realigned,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.277
the blues gone green.

00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:36.630
Your care in conserving
in exchange for my fruit

00:00:36.654 --> 00:00:42.738
and replenishing this picturous
restoring of painted skies,

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:44.593
mountains rolling,

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:46.237
forest covering --

00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:48.223
no more warming.

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:52.622
The purity and simplicity
of how we used to be.

00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:54.161
You remember me?

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:56.853
All I give to humanity?

00:00:56.877 --> 00:01:00.643
Housing, land, seas, birds,

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:03.595
beast and all of mankind,

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:09.129
exclusively the interface
where you and the elements meet

00:01:09.153 --> 00:01:11.673
and vibrate harmoniously.

00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:14.509
(Piano plays)

00:01:17.252 --> 00:01:20.387
(Violin plays)

00:01:45.497 --> 00:01:48.047
(Music)

00:02:17.113 --> 00:02:19.140
(Music tempo quickens)

00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.514

00:04:33.712 --> 00:04:34.998
(Music ends)

00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:38.460
(Applause)

00:04:38.484 --> 00:04:39.664
My beauty altered,

00:04:39.688 --> 00:04:42.093
muddied waters, fields stripped bare,

00:04:42.117 --> 00:04:44.870
interior scarred beyond repair,

00:04:44.894 --> 00:04:47.327
our memories eroding.

00:04:47.848 --> 00:04:50.333
You once obsessed over my frame

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:51.704
and how I came to be;

00:04:51.728 --> 00:04:54.143
my nature, its polarity --

00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:59.847
how my sweet winds whisper softly,
yet assault seas.

00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:01.341
You remember me?

00:05:01.365 --> 00:05:04.063
All I give to humanity?

00:05:04.087 --> 00:05:07.924
Housing, land, seas, birds,

00:05:07.948 --> 00:05:11.018
beast and all of mankind --

00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:16.368
exclusively the interface
where you and the elements meet

00:05:16.392 --> 00:05:18.727
and vibrate harmoniously.

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:22.526
The unseen traveler forever passing,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.037
carrying life,

00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:25.260
moving,

00:05:25.284 --> 00:05:28.728
awning of earth felt and heard,

00:05:28.752 --> 00:05:31.260
strong and stirring,

00:05:31.284 --> 00:05:32.599
blowing.

00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:35.968
Breathe you in, cleansing wind,

00:05:35.992 --> 00:05:37.959
gentle and still,

00:05:37.983 --> 00:05:39.315
quieter.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.001
The source eternally here,

00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:44.500
ascent and descending:

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.499
air.

00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:49.384
Rhythmic flow,

00:05:49.408 --> 00:05:51.470
fluid and graceful,

00:05:51.494 --> 00:05:53.658
waves of serenity,

00:05:53.682 --> 00:05:55.808
smooth strings of purity,

00:05:55.832 --> 00:05:58.735
rains replenishing rapidly,

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:00.988
rivers of dreams,

00:06:01.012 --> 00:06:03.639
raging springs
covering earth in abundance,

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:06.148
universal solvent dissolving,

00:06:06.172 --> 00:06:11.115
drink, liquid, life and power:

00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:13.534
water.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.904
Born when the universe was formed,

00:06:15.928 --> 00:06:17.198
warmed mankind,

00:06:17.222 --> 00:06:18.414
gave him light,

00:06:18.438 --> 00:06:21.422
colored rays illuminate ember flickers

00:06:21.446 --> 00:06:23.533
incandescent, powerful and brilliant.

00:06:23.557 --> 00:06:25.914
Sacred son of air, father of fury,

00:06:25.938 --> 00:06:27.365
heat dancing vigorously

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.236
between perfection and beauty.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.817
Unconfined agility,

00:06:30.841 --> 00:06:32.862
fast and fancy,

00:06:32.886 --> 00:06:35.448
sparks of ingenuity rise:

00:06:36.087 --> 00:06:37.262
fire.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.439
(Canku One Star dances)

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:43.057

00:08:09.882 --> 00:08:11.844

00:08:23.984 --> 00:08:26.307

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:09.426
