00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
There are two groups of women

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
when it comes to screening mammography --

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
women in whom mammography works very well

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and has saved thousands of lives

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and women in whom it doesn't work well at all.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Do you know which group you're in?

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
If you don't, you're not alone.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Because the breast has become

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
a very political organ.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
The truth has become lost

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
in all the rhetoric

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
coming from the press, politicians,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
radiologists

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and medical imaging companies.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
I will do my best this morning

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
to tell you what I think is the truth.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
But first, my disclosures.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
I am not a breast cancer survivor.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I'm not a radiologist.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
I don't have any patents,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and I am not seeking your vote.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
(Laughter)

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
What I am

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
is a doctor of internal medicine

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
who became passionately interested in this topic

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
about 10 years ago

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
when a patient asked me a question.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
She came to see me

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
after discovering a breast lump.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
in her 40s.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
She and I were both very pregnant at that time,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and my heart just ached for her,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
imagining how afraid she must be.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
But she asked me a question:

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
how confident was I

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
if she developed one?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
So I studied her mammogram,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and I reviewed the radiology literature,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and I was shocked to discover

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
that, in her case,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
were less than the toss of a coin.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
You may recall a year ago

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
when a firestorm erupted

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.260
after the United States Preventive Services Task Force

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
reviewed the world's mammography screening literature

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and issued a guideline

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
recommending against screening mammograms

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
in women in their 40s.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
with the mammography studies.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
It took the Senate just 17 days

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
to ban the use of the guidelines

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
in determining insurance coverage.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Radiologists were outraged

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
by the guidelines.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
issued the following quote

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
to the Washington Post.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
The radiologists were, in turn, criticized

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
for protecting their own financial self-interest.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
But in my view,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
the radiologists are heroes.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
There's a shortage of radiologists

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
qualified to read mammograms,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
of all radiology studies to interpret,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and because radiologists

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
are sued more often

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
over missed breast cancer

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
than any other cause.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
But that very fact is telling.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Where there is this much legal smoke,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
there is likely to be some fire.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
The factor most responsible for that fire

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
is breast density.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat --

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
pictured here in yellow --

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
versus connective and epithelial tissues --

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
pictured in pink.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And that proportion

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
is primarily genetically determined.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Two-thirds of women in their 40s

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
have dense breast tissue,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
And although breast density generally declines with age,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
up to a third of women

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
retain dense breast tissue

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
for years after menopause.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
So how do you know if your breasts are dense?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Well, you need to read the details

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
of your mammography report.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Radiologists classify breast density

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
into four categories

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
If the breast is less than 25 percent dense,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
that's called fatty-replaced.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
The next category

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
is scattered fibroglandular densities,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
followed by heterogeneously dense

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
and extremely dense.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And breasts that fall into these two categories

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
are considered dense.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
The problem with breast density

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Both tumors and dense breast tissue

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
appear white on a mammogram,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
So it's easy to see this tumor

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
in the upper part of this fatty breast.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
But imagine how difficult it would be

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
to find that tumor in this dense breast.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
That's why mammograms find

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Now it's bad enough that breast density

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
makes it hard to find a cancer,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
but it turns out

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
that it's also a powerful predictor

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
of your risk for breast cancer.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
It's a stronger risk factor

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
At the time my patient posed this question to me,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
breast density was an obscure topic

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
in the radiology literature,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and very few women having mammograms,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
or the physicians ordering them,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
knew about this.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
But what else could I offer her?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Mammograms have been around since the 1960's,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and it's changed very little.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
There have been surprisingly few innovations,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
until digital mammography was approved

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
in 2000.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
but the images

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
can be stored and manipulated digitally,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
just like we can with a digital camera.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
The U.S. has invested

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
four billion dollars

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
converting to digital mammography equipment,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
and what have we gained from that investment?

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.260
In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
digital mammography was found

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
to be no better over all

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
than traditional mammography,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and in fact, it was worse in older women.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
But it was better in one group,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
and that was women under 50

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and in those women,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
digital mammography found twice as many cancers,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
but it still only found 60 percent.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
So digital mammography

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
has been a giant leap forward

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
for manufacturers

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
of digital mammography equipment,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
but it's been a very small step forward for

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
womankind.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
What about ultrasound?

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Ultrasound generates more biopsies

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
that are unnecessary relative to other technologies,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
so it's not widely used.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
but it's also very expensive.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
If we think about disruptive technology,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
we see an almost ubiquitous pattern

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
of the technology getting smaller and less expensive.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Think about iPods compared to stereos.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
But it's the exact opposite in health care.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
The machines get ever bigger

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and ever more expensive.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
Screening the average young woman with an MRI

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
It's just way too much equipment.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
One MRI scan

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
that health care innovation

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
can't always come at a much higher price.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
on innovation,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
and he made the case that scientific discoveries

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.260
are rarely the product of one individual's genius.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
if you can simply gather

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
people with different perspectives in a room

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and get them to talk about things

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
that they don't ordinarily talk about.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
It's like the essence of TED.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
He quotes one innovator who says,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.260
"The only time a physician and a physicist get together

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
is when the physicist gets sick."

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
(Laughter)

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
This makes no sense,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
because physicians have all kinds of problems

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
that they don't realize have solutions.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
that they don't realize are problems.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
Now, take a look at this cartoon

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
that accompanied Gladwell's article,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
and tell me if you see something disturbing

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
about this depiction of innovative thinkers.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
(Laughter)

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.260
So if you will allow me a little creative license,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
I will tell you the story

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
of the serendipitous collision

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
of my patient's problem

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
with a physicist's solution.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Shortly after her visit,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
I was introduced to a nuclear physicist

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
at Mayo

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
named Michael O'Conner,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
who was a specialist in cardiac imaging,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
something I had nothing to do with.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
And he happened to tell me

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
to image the heart,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and it had even been tried to image the breast.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
But the problem was

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
that the gamma detectors

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
were these huge, bulky tubes,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
and they were filled with these scintillating crystals,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
to find small tumors.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
But the potential advantage was

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
that gamma rays, unlike X-rays,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
are not influenced by breast density.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
But this technology

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
could not find tumors when they're small,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
If you can find a tumor

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
when it's less than a centimeter,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
survival exceeds 90 percent,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
but drops off rapidly

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
as tumor size increases.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
But Michael told me about

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
and this is it.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
It's made

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
not of a bulky tube,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
that serves as the gamma detector.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
And I started talking to him

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
about this problem with breast density,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
and we realized that we might be able to get this detector

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
close enough around the breast

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
to actually find small tumors.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
So after putting together

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
a grid of these cubes with tape --

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
(Laughter)

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
-- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
of a mammography machine

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
that was about to be thrown out,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
and we attached the new detector,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
and we decided to call this machine

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
This is an image from our first patient.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
And you can see, using the old gamma technology,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
that it just looked like noise.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
But using our new detector,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
we could begin to see the outline of a tumor.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
So here we were, a nuclear physicist,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
an internist,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
and two radiologists,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
and we were trying to take on

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
the entrenched world of mammography

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
with a machine that was held together by duct tape.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
To say that we faced

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
high doses of skepticism

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
in those early years

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
is just a huge understatement,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
that we chipped away with incremental modifications

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
to this system.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
This is our current detector.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
And you can see that it looks a lot different.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.260
The duct tape is gone,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
and we added a second detector on top of the breast,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
which has further improved our tumor detection.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
So how does this work?

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
but not by normal cells,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
and this is the key difference from mammography.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
Mammography relies on differences

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
and we've seen that those differences

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
can be obscured in a dense breast.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
But MBI exploits

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
the different molecular behavior of tumors,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
and therefore, it's impervious to breast density.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
After the injection,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
the patient's breast is placed between the detectors.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
And if you've ever had a mammogram --

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
if you're old enough to have had a mammogram --

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
you know what comes next:

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
pain.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
You may be surprised to know

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
that mammography is the only radiologic study

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
that's regulated by federal law,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
and the law requires

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
come down on your breast during this study.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
But with MBI,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
we use just light, pain-free compression.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:03.260
(Applause)

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
And the detector

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
then transmits the image to the computer.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
So here's an example.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
You can see, on the right, a mammogram

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
showing a faint tumor,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
as well as a second tumor,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors --

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
one is small as three millimeters.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Our big break came in 2004.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
we used these images

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
And we were elated when they took a chance

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
on a team of completely unknown investigators

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
and funded us to study

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
1,000 women with dense breasts,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
Of the tumors that we found,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
mammography found

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
only 25 percent of those tumors.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
MBI found 83 percent.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
Here's an example from that screening study.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
The digital mammogram was read as normal

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
and shows lots of dense tissue,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
In this case, a one-centimeter tumor.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
And in this case,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
wanted to enroll in our study.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
but her MBI showed an area

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
of worrisome uptake,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
which we can also see on a color image.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
And this corresponded

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
to a tumor the size of a golf ball.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
But fortunately it was removed

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
before it had spread to her lymph nodes.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
So now that we knew that this technology

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
could find three times more tumors in a dense breast,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
we had to solve one very important problem.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
and we have spent the last three years

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
to allow this.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
that is equivalent to the effective dose

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
from one digital mammogram.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
and this image from three weeks ago

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
in a 67-year-old woman

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
shows a normal digital mammogram,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
but an MBI image

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
So this is not just young women that it's benefiting.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
It's also older women with dense tissue.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
that's used in any other type of gamma technology.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
MBI generates four images per breast.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
MRI generates over a thousand.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
It takes a radiologist

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
years of specialty training

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
to become expert in differentiating

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
the normal anatomic detail

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
from the worrisome finding.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
can find the tumor on the MBI image.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
But this is why MBI

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
is so potentially disruptive --

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
it's as accurate as MRI,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
it's far less complex to interpret,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
and it's a fraction of the cost.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
But you can understand why there may be

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
forces in the breast-imaging world

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
who prefer the status quo.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
After achieving what we felt were remarkable results,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
our manuscript was rejected

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
by four journals.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
After the fourth rejection,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
we requested reconsideration of the manuscript,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
because we strongly suspected

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
that one of the reviewers who had rejected it

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
had a financial conflict of interest

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
in a competing technology.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
Our manuscript was then accepted

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
and will be published later this month

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
in the journal Radiology.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:05.260
(Applause)

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
and then our findings will need to be replicated

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
at other institutions,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
and this could take five or more years.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
If this technology is widely adopted,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
I will not benefit financially in any way,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
and that is very important to me,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
But I recognize --

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.260
(Applause)

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
I recognize that the adoption of this technology

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
will depend as much on economic

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
and political forces

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
as it will on the soundness of the science.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.260
The MBI unit has now been FDA approved,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
but it's not yet widely available.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
So until something is available

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
for women with dense breasts,

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
there are things that you should know

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
to protect yourself.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
First, know your density.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
Ninety percent of women don't,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
and 95 percent of women don't know

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
that it increases your breast cancer risk.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260
The State of Connecticut became the first and only state

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
to mandate that women receive notification

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
of their breast density

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
after a mammogram.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.260
I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
last week in Chicago,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
and I was stunned that there was a heated debate

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
as to whether we should be telling women

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
what their breast density is.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
Of course we should.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.260
And if you don't know, please ask your doctor

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.260
or read the details of your mammography report.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.260
Second, if you're pre-menopausal,

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.260
try to schedule your mammogram

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
when breast density is relatively lower.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.260
Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.260
insist on additional imaging.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
And fourth and most important,

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.260
the mammography debate will rage on,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.260
but I do believe that all women 40 and older

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
should have an annual mammogram.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.260
Mammography isn't perfect,

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.260
but it's the only test that's been proven

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.260
to reduce mortality from breast cancer.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
But this mortality banner

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260
is the very sword

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.260
which mammography's most ardent advocates use

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
to deter innovation.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.260
Some women who develop breast cancer

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.260
die from it many years later,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.260
and most women, thankfully, survive.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.260
So it takes 10 or more years

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260
for any screening method

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
to demonstrate a reduction

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.260
in mortality from breast cancer.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.260
Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.260
to have a chance of making that claim.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.260
It is time for us to accept

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.260
both the extraordinary successes of mammography

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
and the limitations.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.260
We need to individualize screening

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.260
based on density.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.260
For women without dense breasts,

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.260
mammography is the best choice.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.260
But for women with dense breasts;

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.260
we shouldn't abandon screening altogether,

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.260
we need to offer them something better.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.260
The babies that we were carrying

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.260
when my patient first asked me this question

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.260
are now both in middle school,

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.260
and the answer has been so slow to come.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.260
She's given me her blessing

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.260
to share this story with you.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.260
After undergoing biopsies

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.260
that further increased her risk for cancer

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.260
and losing her sister to cancer,

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.260
she made the difficult decision

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.260
to have a prophylactic mastectomy.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.260
We can and must do better,

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.260
not just in time for her granddaughters

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.260
and my daughters,

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.260
but in time for you.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.260
Thank you.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:21:02.260
(Applause)
