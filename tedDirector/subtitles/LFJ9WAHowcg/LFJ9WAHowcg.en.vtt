00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:13.464
I've come here today

00:00:13.464 --> 00:00:16.151
to talk to you about a problem.

00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:19.678
It's a very simple yet devastating problem,

00:00:19.678 --> 00:00:21.623
one that spans the globe

00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:24.536
and is affecting all of us.

00:00:24.536 --> 00:00:26.621
The problem is

00:00:26.621 --> 00:00:29.346
anonymous companies.

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:31.436
It sounds like a really dry and technical thing,

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:32.492
doesn't it?

00:00:32.492 --> 00:00:34.994
But anonymous companies are making it difficult

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:37.546
and sometimes impossible

00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:39.395
to find out

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:42.394
the actual human beings responsible

00:00:42.394 --> 00:00:47.604
sometimes for really terrible crimes.

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:52.646
So, why am I here talking to all of you?

00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:56.176
Well, I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker

00:00:56.176 --> 00:00:59.127
and when my parents taught my twin brother and I

00:00:59.127 --> 00:01:01.033
to question authority,

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:03.044
I don't think they knew where it might lead.

00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:04.399
(Laughter)

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.238
And, they probably really regretted it

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:09.376
during my stroppy teenage years when, predictably,

00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:11.994
I questioned their authority a lot.

00:01:11.994 --> 00:01:13.589
And a lot of my school teachers

00:01:13.589 --> 00:01:16.717
didn't appreciate it much either.

00:01:16.717 --> 00:01:18.852
You see, since the age of about five

00:01:18.852 --> 00:01:22.525
I've always asked the question, but why?

00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:25.154
But why does the Earth go around the sun?

00:01:25.154 --> 00:01:26.991
But why is blood red?

00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:29.298
But why do I have to go to school?

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:31.311
But why do I have to respect the teachers

00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:33.178
and authority?

00:01:33.178 --> 00:01:34.820
And little did I realize

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.598
that this question would become the basis

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:40.251
of everything I would do.

00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:42.006
And so it was

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.490
in my twenties, a long time ago,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.571
that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London

00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:50.360
I was sitting with Simon Taylor

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.368
and Patrick Alley

00:01:52.368 --> 00:01:54.233
and we were busy stuffing envelopes

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:57.283
for a mail out in the office of the campaign group

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.538
where we worked at the time.

00:01:59.538 --> 00:02:03.623
And as usual, we were talking 
about the world's problems.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.437
And in particular, we were talking about

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:08.357
the civil war in Cambodia.

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:12.588
And we had talked about that 
many, many times before.

00:02:12.588 --> 00:02:14.875
But then suddenly we stopped

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:16.419
and looked at each other

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:20.648
and said, but why don't we try and change this?

00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:23.251
And from that slightly crazy question,

00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:25.093
over two decades

00:02:25.093 --> 00:02:27.359
and many campaigns later,

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.150
including alerting the world

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.366
to the problem of blood diamonds funding war,

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:34.427
from that crazy question,

00:02:34.427 --> 00:02:37.288
Global Witness is now an 80-strong team

00:02:37.288 --> 00:02:41.810
of campaigners, investigators, 
journalists and lawyers.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.113
And we're all driven by the same belief,

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:48.577
that change really is possible.

00:02:48.577 --> 00:02:51.696
So, what exactly does Global Witness do?

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:53.930
We investigate, we report,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.652
to uncover the people really responsible

00:02:56.652 --> 00:02:58.565
for funding conflict --

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:02.076
for stealing millions from citizens around the world,

00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:03.913
also known as state looting,

00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:06.522
and for destroying the environment.

00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:11.686
And then we campaign hard to 
change the system itself.

00:03:11.686 --> 00:03:14.447
And we're doing this because 
so many of the countries

00:03:14.447 --> 00:03:16.323
rich in natural resources

00:03:16.323 --> 00:03:19.035
like oil or diamonds or timber

00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:21.539
are home to some of the poorest

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:25.939
and most dispossessed people on the planet.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.433
And much of this injustice

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:29.087
is made possible

00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:32.819
by currently accepted business practices.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.036
And one of these is anonymous companies.

00:03:37.036 --> 00:03:39.130
Now we've come up against anonymous companies

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.270
in lots of our investigations,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.952
like in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:46.704
where we exposed how secretive deals

00:03:46.704 --> 00:03:48.337
involving anonymous companies

00:03:48.337 --> 00:03:50.522
had deprived the citizens

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:54.487
of one of the poorest countries on the planet

00:03:54.487 --> 00:03:56.363
of well over a billion dollars.

00:03:56.363 --> 00:04:01.894
That's twice the country's health 
and education budget combined.

00:04:01.894 --> 00:04:03.215
Or in Liberia,

00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:06.063
where an international predatory logging company

00:04:06.063 --> 00:04:08.626
used front companies as it attempted to grab

00:04:08.626 --> 00:04:12.815
a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests.

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:15.898
Or political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia,

00:04:15.898 --> 00:04:19.093
which has led to the destruction 
of much of its forests.

00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:23.234
Well, that uses anonymous companies too.

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:25.523
We secretly filmed some of the family

00:04:25.523 --> 00:04:28.320
of the former chief minister and a lawyer

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.592
as they told our undercover investigator

00:04:30.592 --> 00:04:33.344
exactly how these dubious deals are done

00:04:33.344 --> 00:04:36.420
using such companies.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.193
And the awful thing is,

00:04:38.193 --> 00:04:41.499
there are so many other examples out there

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:45.503
from all walks of life.

00:04:45.503 --> 00:04:49.721
This truly is a scandal of epic proportions

00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:52.486
hidden in plain sight.

00:04:52.486 --> 00:04:55.265
Whether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel,

00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:56.308
the Zetas,

00:04:56.308 --> 00:04:58.962
who use anonymous companies 
to launder profits

00:04:58.962 --> 00:05:00.908
while their drugs-related violence

00:05:00.908 --> 00:05:05.526
is tearing communities apart across the Americas.

00:05:05.526 --> 00:05:07.474
Or the anonymous company,

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.745
which bought up Americans' tax debts,

00:05:09.745 --> 00:05:11.537
piled on the legal fees

00:05:11.537 --> 00:05:12.921
and then gave homeowners a choice:

00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:15.935
Pay up or lose your home.

00:05:15.935 --> 00:05:18.613
Imagine being threatened with losing your home

00:05:18.613 --> 00:05:21.327
sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars,

00:05:21.327 --> 00:05:22.697
and not being able to find out

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:26.233
who you were really up against.

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:27.672
Now anonymous companies

00:05:27.672 --> 00:05:30.546
are great for sanctions busting too.

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:33.092
As the Iranian government found out

00:05:33.092 --> 00:05:34.927
when, through a series of front companies,

00:05:34.927 --> 00:05:38.020
it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.314
on Fifth Avenue,

00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:43.209
despite American sanctions.

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:46.343
And Juicy Couture, home of of the velvet track suit,

00:05:46.343 --> 00:05:49.072
and other companies were the unwitting,

00:05:49.072 --> 00:05:52.179
unknowing tenants there.

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:54.310
There are just so many examples,

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.766
the horesemeat scandal in Europe,

00:05:56.766 --> 00:05:59.263
the Italian mafia, they've used these companies

00:05:59.263 --> 00:06:01.052
for decades.

00:06:01.052 --> 00:06:06.811
The $100 million American Medicare fraud,

00:06:06.811 --> 00:06:10.583
the supply of weapons to wars around the world

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:11.610
including those

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.396
in Eastern Europe in the early '90s.

00:06:14.396 --> 00:06:15.674
Anonymous companies

00:06:15.674 --> 00:06:17.330
have even come to light

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.696
in the recent revolution in the Ukraine.

00:06:21.696 --> 00:06:26.201
But, for every case that we and others expose

00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:29.418
there are so many more that will remain hidden away

00:06:29.418 --> 00:06:31.815
because of the current system.

00:06:31.815 --> 00:06:33.774
And it's just a simple truth

00:06:33.774 --> 00:06:38.391
that some of the people responsible 
for outrageous crimes,

00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:40.631
for stealing from you and me

00:06:40.631 --> 00:06:42.675
and millions of others,

00:06:42.675 --> 00:06:43.858
they are remaining faceless

00:06:43.858 --> 00:06:46.343
and they are escaping accountability

00:06:46.343 --> 00:06:48.515
and they're doing this with ease,

00:06:48.515 --> 00:06:51.930
and they're doing it using legal structures.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.951
And really, that is unfair.

00:06:56.951 --> 00:06:58.890
Well, you might well ask,

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.784
what exactly is an anonymous company,

00:07:01.784 --> 00:07:04.192
and can I really set one up, and use it,

00:07:04.192 --> 00:07:06.920
without anyone knowing who I am?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.651
Well, the answer is, yes you can.

00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:10.366
But if you're anything like me,

00:07:10.366 --> 00:07:12.378
you'll want to see some of that for yourself,

00:07:12.378 --> 00:07:14.086
so let me show you.

00:07:14.086 --> 00:07:15.403
Well first you need to work out

00:07:15.403 --> 00:07:17.441
where you want to set it up.

00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:19.418
Now, at this point you might be imagining

00:07:19.418 --> 00:07:22.936
one of those lovely tropical island tax havens

00:07:22.936 --> 00:07:24.941
but here's the thing,

00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:26.138
shockingly,

00:07:26.138 --> 00:07:28.482
my own hometown, London,

00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:29.811
and indeed the U.K.,

00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:32.533
is one of the best places in the world

00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:35.437
to set up an anonymous company.

00:07:35.437 --> 00:07:38.126
And the other, even better,

00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:42.049
I'm afraid that's America.

00:07:42.049 --> 00:07:44.505
Do you know, in some states across America

00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:46.822
you need less identification

00:07:46.822 --> 00:07:48.289
to open up a company

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:51.406
than you do to get a library card,

00:07:51.406 --> 00:07:52.662
like Delaware,

00:07:52.662 --> 00:07:54.744
which is one of the easiest places

00:07:54.744 --> 00:07:58.983
in the world to set up an anonymous company.

00:07:58.983 --> 00:08:00.584
Okay, so let's say it's America,

00:08:00.584 --> 00:08:02.659
and let's say it's Delaware,

00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:04.522
and now you can simply go online

00:08:04.522 --> 00:08:07.620
and find yourself a company service provider.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.603
These are the companies that 
can set your one up for you,

00:08:10.603 --> 00:08:14.745
and remember, it's all legal,
routine business practice.

00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:16.384
So, here's one,

00:08:16.384 --> 00:08:19.311
but there are plenty of others to choose from.

00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:20.942
And having made your choice,

00:08:20.942 --> 00:08:23.448
you then pick what type of company you want

00:08:23.448 --> 00:08:26.564
and then fill in a contact, name and address.

00:08:26.564 --> 00:08:27.748
But don't worry,

00:08:27.748 --> 00:08:29.307
it doesn't have to be your name.

00:08:29.307 --> 00:08:30.789
It can be your lawyer's

00:08:30.789 --> 00:08:32.688
or your service provider's,

00:08:32.688 --> 00:08:36.523
and it's not for the public record anyway.

00:08:36.523 --> 00:08:39.080
And then you add the owner of the company.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.019
Now this is the key part,

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:42.899
and again it doesn't have to be you,

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:45.002
because you can get creative,

00:08:45.002 --> 00:08:48.551
because there is a whole universe 
out there of nominees

00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:50.398
to choose from.

00:08:50.398 --> 00:08:52.734
And nominees are the people that you

00:08:52.734 --> 00:08:57.570
can legally pay to be your company's owner.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.412
And if you don't want to involve anyone else,

00:08:59.412 --> 00:09:02.275
it doesn't even have to be an actual human being.

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:05.363
It could be another company.

00:09:05.363 --> 00:09:06.793
And then finally,

00:09:06.793 --> 00:09:08.522
give your company a name

00:09:08.522 --> 00:09:11.253
add a few more details and make your payment.

00:09:11.253 --> 00:09:12.673
And then the service provider

00:09:12.673 --> 00:09:15.456
will take a few hours or more to process it.

00:09:15.456 --> 00:09:16.695
But there you are,

00:09:16.695 --> 00:09:19.075
in 10 minutes of online shopping

00:09:19.075 --> 00:09:23.289
you can create yourself an anonymous company.

00:09:23.289 --> 00:09:24.677
And not only is it easy,

00:09:24.677 --> 00:09:27.284
really, really easy and cheap,

00:09:27.284 --> 00:09:29.572
it's totally legal too.

00:09:29.572 --> 00:09:33.296
But the fun doesn't have to end there,

00:09:33.296 --> 00:09:36.095
maybe you want to be even more anonymous.

00:09:36.095 --> 00:09:38.198
Well, that's no problem either.

00:09:38.198 --> 00:09:40.956
You can simply keep adding layers,

00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:43.056
companies owned by companies.

00:09:43.056 --> 00:09:44.436
You can have hundreds of layers

00:09:44.436 --> 00:09:46.524
with hundreds of companies spread across

00:09:46.524 --> 00:09:49.181
lots of different countries,

00:09:49.181 --> 00:09:50.511
like a giant web,

00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:52.700
each layer adds anonymity.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.930
Each layer makes it more difficult

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.619
for law enforcement and others

00:09:56.619 --> 00:10:00.002
to find out who the real owner is.

00:10:00.002 --> 00:10:04.092
But whose interests is this all serving?

00:10:04.092 --> 00:10:06.218
It might be in the interests of the company

00:10:06.218 --> 00:10:07.984
or a particular individual,

00:10:07.984 --> 00:10:10.372
but what about all of us, the public?

00:10:10.372 --> 00:10:13.141
There hasn't even been a global conversation yet

00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:14.561
about whether it's okay

00:10:14.561 --> 00:10:17.796
to misuse companies in this way.

00:10:17.796 --> 00:10:21.674
And what does it all mean for us?

00:10:21.674 --> 00:10:24.227
Well, an example that really haunts me

00:10:24.227 --> 00:10:26.605
is one I came across recently.

00:10:26.605 --> 00:10:28.554
And it's that of a horrific fire

00:10:28.554 --> 00:10:30.339
in a nightclub in Buenos Aires

00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:33.290
about a decade ago.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.560
It was the night before New Year's Eve.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.728
Three thousand very happy revelers,

00:10:37.728 --> 00:10:38.765
many of them teenagers,

00:10:38.765 --> 00:10:41.960
were crammed into a space meant for 1,000.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.133
And then tragedy struck,

00:10:43.133 --> 00:10:44.736
a fire broke out

00:10:44.736 --> 00:10:46.820
plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.796
and toxic smoke filled the club.

00:10:48.796 --> 00:10:50.861
So people tried to escape

00:10:50.861 --> 00:10:53.494
only to find that some of the fire doors

00:10:53.494 --> 00:10:57.155
had been chained shut.

00:10:57.155 --> 00:10:59.588
Over 200 people died.

00:10:59.588 --> 00:11:03.347
Seven hundred were injured trying to get out.

00:11:03.347 --> 00:11:06.892
And as the victims' families 
and the city and the country

00:11:06.892 --> 00:11:08.436
reeled in shock,

00:11:08.436 --> 00:11:11.982
investigators tried to find out who was responsible.

00:11:11.982 --> 00:11:14.473
And as they looked for the owners of the club,

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:18.031
they found instead anonymous companies,

00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:20.325
and confusion surrounded the identities of those

00:11:20.325 --> 00:11:22.832
involved with the companies.

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:25.294
Now ultimately, a range of people were charged

00:11:25.294 --> 00:11:27.321
and some went to jail.

00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:29.154
But this was an awful tragedy,

00:11:29.154 --> 00:11:31.137
and it shouldn't have been so difficult

00:11:31.137 --> 00:11:35.047
just to try and find out who was responsible

00:11:35.047 --> 00:11:38.008
for those deaths.

00:11:38.008 --> 00:11:39.953
Because in an age

00:11:39.953 --> 00:11:42.207
when there is so much information

00:11:42.207 --> 00:11:44.204
out there in the open,

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.878
why should this crucial information

00:11:45.878 --> 00:11:47.388
about company ownership

00:11:47.388 --> 00:11:49.094
stay hidden away?

00:11:49.094 --> 00:11:52.819
Why should tax evaders, corrupt 
government officials,

00:11:52.819 --> 00:11:55.071
arms traders and more,

00:11:55.071 --> 00:11:59.109
be able to hide their identities from us, the public?

00:11:59.109 --> 00:12:04.738
Why should this secrecy be such 
an accepted business practice?

00:12:04.738 --> 00:12:06.426
Anonymous companies

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:08.635
might be the norm right now

00:12:08.635 --> 00:12:10.641
but it wasn't always this way.

00:12:10.641 --> 00:12:12.438
Companies were created

00:12:12.438 --> 00:12:14.710
to give people a chance to innovate

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.373
and not have to put everything on the line.

00:12:18.373 --> 00:12:21.715
Companies were created to limit financial risk,

00:12:21.715 --> 00:12:26.665
they were never intended to 
be used as a moral shield.

00:12:26.665 --> 00:12:28.939
Companies were never intended to be anonymous,

00:12:28.939 --> 00:12:31.355
and they don't have to be.

00:12:31.355 --> 00:12:34.245
And so I come to my wish.

00:12:34.245 --> 00:12:37.046
My wish is for us to know

00:12:37.046 --> 00:12:39.772
who owns and controls companies

00:12:39.772 --> 00:12:42.522
so that they can no longer be used anonymously

00:12:42.522 --> 00:12:45.152
against the public good.

00:12:45.152 --> 00:12:47.818
Together let's ignite world opinion,

00:12:47.818 --> 00:12:49.295
change the law,

00:12:49.295 --> 00:12:54.175
and launch a new era of openness in business.

00:12:54.175 --> 00:12:55.807
So what might this look like?

00:12:55.807 --> 00:12:58.376
Well, imagine if you could go online

00:12:58.376 --> 00:13:01.493
and look up the real owner of a company.

00:13:01.493 --> 00:13:04.265
Imagine if this data were open and free,

00:13:04.265 --> 00:13:05.976
accessible across borders

00:13:05.976 --> 00:13:07.775
for citizens and businesses

00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:09.463
and law enforcement alike.

00:13:09.463 --> 00:13:13.931
Imagine what a game changer that would be.

00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:16.434
So how are we going to do this?

00:13:16.434 --> 00:13:17.880
Well, there is only one way.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.131
Together, we have to change the law globally

00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:23.072
to create public registries

00:13:23.072 --> 00:13:25.927
which list the true owners of companies

00:13:25.927 --> 00:13:27.963
and can be accessed by all

00:13:27.963 --> 00:13:30.092
with no loopholes.

00:13:30.092 --> 00:13:33.824
And yes, this is ambitious,

00:13:33.824 --> 00:13:36.215
but there is momentum on this issue,

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:38.259
and over the years I have seen

00:13:38.259 --> 00:13:40.591
the sheer power of momentum,

00:13:40.591 --> 00:13:42.975
and it's just starting on this issue.

00:13:42.975 --> 00:13:46.253
There is such an opportunity right now.

00:13:46.253 --> 00:13:48.282
And the TED community

00:13:48.282 --> 00:13:51.647
of creative and innovative thinkers and doers

00:13:51.647 --> 00:13:53.544
across all of society

00:13:53.544 --> 00:13:56.803
could make the crucial difference.

00:13:56.803 --> 00:14:00.637
You really can make this change happen.

00:14:00.637 --> 00:14:02.439
Now, a simple starting point

00:14:02.439 --> 00:14:03.905
is the address behind me

00:14:03.905 --> 00:14:06.264
for a Facebook page that you can join now

00:14:06.264 --> 00:14:09.010
to support the campaign and spread the word.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.434
It's going to be a springboard

00:14:10.434 --> 00:14:12.395
for our global campaigning.

00:14:12.395 --> 00:14:13.870
And the techies among you,

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.243
you could really help us create a prototype

00:14:17.243 --> 00:14:18.963
public registry

00:14:18.963 --> 00:14:23.839
to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be.

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:26.350
Campaign groups from around the world

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:31.210
have come together to work on this issue.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.490
The U.K. government is already on board;

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.892
it supports these public registries.

00:14:36.892 --> 00:14:38.790
And just last week,

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.498
the European Parliament came on board

00:14:41.498 --> 00:14:46.564
with a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries.

00:14:46.564 --> 00:14:48.989
That is momentum.

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:52.817
(Applause)

00:14:53.985 --> 00:14:56.290
But it's early days.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.782
America still needs to come on board,

00:14:58.782 --> 00:15:02.359
as do so many other countries.

00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:05.468
And to succeed we will all together

00:15:05.468 --> 00:15:07.912
need to help and push our politicians,

00:15:07.912 --> 00:15:09.499
because without that,

00:15:09.499 --> 00:15:11.467
real far-reaching, world-shifting change

00:15:11.467 --> 00:15:14.168
just isn't going to happen.

00:15:14.168 --> 00:15:16.857
Because this isn't just about changing the law,

00:15:16.857 --> 00:15:18.949
this is about starting a conversation

00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:21.342
about what it's okay for companies to do,

00:15:21.342 --> 00:15:26.376
and in what ways is it acceptable 
to use company structures.

00:15:26.376 --> 00:15:29.149
This isn't just a dry policy issue.

00:15:29.149 --> 00:15:30.637
This is a human issue

00:15:30.637 --> 00:15:33.295
which affects us all.

00:15:33.295 --> 00:15:39.699
This is about being on the right side of history.

00:15:39.699 --> 00:15:45.057
Global citizens, innovators, 
business leaders, individuals,

00:15:45.057 --> 00:15:47.044
we need you.

00:15:47.044 --> 00:15:50.554
Together, let's kickstart this global movement.

00:15:50.554 --> 00:15:51.899
Let's just do it,

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:55.201
let's end anonymous companies.

00:15:55.201 --> 00:15:57.305
Thank you.

00:15:57.305 --> 00:16:00.751
(Applause)
