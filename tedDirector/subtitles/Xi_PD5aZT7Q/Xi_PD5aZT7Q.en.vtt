00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:16.138
This is my grandfather.

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:18.482
And this is my son.

00:00:18.506 --> 00:00:20.710
My grandfather taught me to work with wood

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:22.344
when I was a little boy,

00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:24.347
and he also taught me the idea that

00:00:24.371 --> 00:00:27.256
if you cut down a tree
to turn it into something,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.535
honor that tree's life
and make it as beautiful

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:31.685
as you possibly can.

00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:35.197
My little boy reminded me

00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:38.076
that for all the technology
and all the toys in the world,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.466
sometimes just a small block of wood,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.297
if you stack it up tall,

00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:46.380
actually is an incredibly inspiring thing.

00:00:46.404 --> 00:00:48.217
These are my buildings.

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:49.937
I build all around the world

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:52.769
out of our office
in Vancouver and New York.

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:55.530
And we build buildings
of different sizes and styles

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:57.556
and different materials,
depending on where we are.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.839
But wood is the material
that I love the most,

00:00:59.863 --> 00:01:01.794
and I'm going to tell you
the story about wood.

00:01:01.818 --> 00:01:03.790
And part of the reason
I love it is that every time

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:06.083
people go into my buildings that are wood,

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:08.829
I notice they react
completely differently.

00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:11.377
I've never seen anybody walk
into one of my buildings

00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:13.730
and hug a steel or a concrete column,

00:01:13.754 --> 00:01:16.629
but I've actually seen
that happen in a wood building.

00:01:16.654 --> 00:01:19.126
I've actually seen
how people touch the wood,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.211
and I think there's a reason for it.

00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:23.717
Just like snowflakes,
no two pieces of wood

00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:26.401
can ever be the same anywhere on Earth.

00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:28.298
That's a wonderful thing.

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:30.834
I like to think that wood

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:34.395
gives Mother Nature
fingerprints in our buildings.

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:36.481
It's Mother
Nature's fingerprints that make

00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:41.127
our buildings connect us to nature
in the built environment.

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:43.189
Now, I live in Vancouver, near a forest

00:01:43.213 --> 00:01:46.266
that grows to 33 stories tall.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.814
Down the coast here
in California, the redwood forest

00:01:48.838 --> 00:01:51.866
grows to 40 stories tall.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.508
But the buildings
that we think about in wood

00:01:54.532 --> 00:01:57.613
are only four stories tall
in most places on Earth.

00:01:57.637 --> 00:02:01.334
Even building codes actually limit
the ability for us to build

00:02:01.358 --> 00:02:03.717
much taller than four
stories in many places,

00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:05.741
and that's true here in the United States.

00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:07.569
Now there are exceptions,

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:09.117
but there needs to be some exceptions,

00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:11.189
and things are going
to change, I'm hoping.

00:02:11.213 --> 00:02:13.162
And the reason I think that way is that

00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:16.286
today half of us live in cities,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.674
and that number is going
to grow to 75 percent.

00:02:19.698 --> 00:02:21.759
Cities and density mean that our buildings

00:02:21.783 --> 00:02:24.205
are going to continue to be big,

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:28.023
and I think there's a role
for wood to play in cities.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:31.179
And I feel that way
because three billion people

00:02:31.203 --> 00:02:34.025
in the world today,
over the next 20 years,

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.545
will need a new home.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.093
That's 40 percent of the world
that are going to need

00:02:38.117 --> 00:02:41.178
a new building built for them
in the next 20 years.

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:43.753
Now, one in three people
living in cities today

00:02:43.777 --> 00:02:45.603
actually live in a slum.

00:02:45.627 --> 00:02:48.944
That's one billion people
in the world live in slums.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:53.265
A hundred million people
in the world are homeless.

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.856
The scale of the challenge for architects

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.997
and for society to deal with in building

00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:02.591
is to find a solution
to house these people.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:06.071
But the challenge is,
as we move to cities,

00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:09.060
cities are built in these two materials,

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:12.306
steel and concrete,
and they're great materials.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.408
They're the materials of the last century.

00:03:14.432 --> 00:03:16.997
But they're also materials
with very high energy

00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:21.316
and very high greenhouse gas
emissions in their process.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.591
Steel represents about three percent

00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:25.911
of man's greenhouse gas emissions,

00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:28.512
and concrete is over five percent.

00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:31.126
So if you think about that, eight percent

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.543
of our contribution
to greenhouse gases today

00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:37.711
comes from those two materials alone.

00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:40.127
We don't think about it
a lot, and unfortunately,

00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:42.723
we actually don't even think
about buildings, I think,

00:03:42.747 --> 00:03:43.923
as much as we should.

00:03:43.947 --> 00:03:47.543
This is a U.S. statistic
about the impact of greenhouse gases.

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:50.809
Almost half of our greenhouse gases
are related to the building industry,

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:53.096
and if we look at energy,
it's the same story.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.263
You'll notice that transportation's sort
of second down that list,

00:03:56.287 --> 00:03:58.953
but that's the conversation
we mostly hear about.

00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:02.519
And although a lot
of that is about energy,

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:05.400
it's also so much about carbon.

00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:08.383
The problem I see is that, ultimately,

00:04:08.407 --> 00:04:10.690
the clash of how we solve that problem

00:04:10.714 --> 00:04:13.958
of serving those three billion people
that need a home,

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:17.430
and climate change,
are a head-on collision

00:04:17.454 --> 00:04:20.383
about to happen, or already happening.

00:04:20.407 --> 00:04:23.094
That challenge means that we have
to start thinking in new ways,

00:04:23.118 --> 00:04:25.690
and I think wood is going
to be part of that solution,

00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:27.276
and I'm going to tell
you the story of why.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.690
As an architect, wood
is the only material,

00:04:29.714 --> 00:04:32.106
big material, that I can build with

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.076
that's already grown
by the power of the sun.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.854
When a tree grows in the forest
and gives off oxygen

00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:40.951
and soaks up carbon dioxide,

00:04:40.975 --> 00:04:43.917
and it dies and it falls
to the forest floor,

00:04:43.941 --> 00:04:48.222
it gives that carbon dioxide back
to the atmosphere or into the ground.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:51.192
If it burns in a forest fire,
it's going to give that carbon

00:04:51.216 --> 00:04:53.628
back to the atmosphere as well.

00:04:53.652 --> 00:04:56.672
But if you take that wood
and you put it into a building

00:04:56.696 --> 00:05:00.008
or into a piece of furniture
or into that wooden toy,

00:05:00.032 --> 00:05:01.699
it actually has an amazing capacity

00:05:01.723 --> 00:05:05.854
to store the carbon and provide
us with a sequestration.

00:05:05.878 --> 00:05:09.133
One cubic meter of wood will store

00:05:09.157 --> 00:05:11.899
one tonne of carbon dioxide.

00:05:11.923 --> 00:05:14.114
Now our two solutions
to climate are obviously

00:05:14.138 --> 00:05:16.650
to reduce our emissions and find storage.

00:05:16.674 --> 00:05:19.008
Wood is the only major
material building material

00:05:19.032 --> 00:05:22.608
I can build with that actually
does both those two things.

00:05:22.632 --> 00:05:25.709
So I believe that we have

00:05:25.733 --> 00:05:28.261
an ethic that the Earth grows our food,

00:05:28.285 --> 00:05:30.524
and we need to move
to an ethic in this century

00:05:30.548 --> 00:05:33.205
that the Earth should grow our homes.

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:34.774
Now, how are we going to do that

00:05:34.798 --> 00:05:36.064
when we're urbanizing at this rate

00:05:36.088 --> 00:05:38.664
and we think about wood
buildings only at four stories?

00:05:38.688 --> 00:05:41.165
We need to reduce the concrete
and steel and we need

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:43.380
to grow bigger,
and what we've been working on

00:05:43.404 --> 00:05:47.728
is 30-story tall buildings made of wood.

00:05:47.752 --> 00:05:51.326
We've been engineering
them with an engineer

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.776
named Eric Karsh who works with me on it,

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.089
and we've been doing this new work because

00:05:56.113 --> 00:05:58.634
there are new wood products
out there for us to use,

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:00.856
and we call them mass timber panels.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.179
These are panels made with young trees,

00:06:03.203 --> 00:06:06.821
small growth trees, small pieces of wood

00:06:06.845 --> 00:06:09.340
glued together to make
panels that are enormous:

00:06:09.364 --> 00:06:13.695
eight feet wide, 64 feet long,
and of various thicknesses.

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:16.834
The way I describe this
best, I've found, is to say

00:06:16.858 --> 00:06:19.097
that we're all used
to two-by-four construction

00:06:19.121 --> 00:06:20.104
when we think about wood.

00:06:20.128 --> 00:06:22.423
That's what people jump
to as a conclusion.

00:06:22.447 --> 00:06:24.295
Two-by-four construction
is sort of like the little

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.034
eight-dot bricks of Lego
that we all played with as kids,

00:06:27.058 --> 00:06:29.971
and you can make all kinds
of cool things out of Lego

00:06:29.995 --> 00:06:32.890
at that size, and out of two-by-fours.

00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:33.758
But do remember when you were a kid,

00:06:33.782 --> 00:06:36.497
and you kind of sifted
through the pile in your basement,

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.631
and you found that big
24-dot brick of Lego,

00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:39.466
and you were kind of like,

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.620
"Cool, this is awesome. I can
build something really big,

00:06:41.644 --> 00:06:43.199
and this is going to be great."

00:06:43.223 --> 00:06:44.542
That's the change.

00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:47.488
Mass timber panels
are those 24-dot bricks.

00:06:47.512 --> 00:06:49.189
They're changing the scale
of what we can do,

00:06:49.213 --> 00:06:51.862
and what we've developed
is something we call FFTT,

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:54.316
which is a Creative Commons solution

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.231
to building a very flexible system

00:06:59.255 --> 00:07:01.914
of building with these large
panels where we tilt up

00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:05.773
six stories at a time if we want to.

00:07:05.797 --> 00:07:09.389
This animation shows you
how the building goes together

00:07:09.413 --> 00:07:12.945
in a very simple way, but these
buildings are available

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:15.198
for architects and engineers
now to build on

00:07:15.222 --> 00:07:16.937
for different cultures in the world,

00:07:16.961 --> 00:07:19.540
different architectural
styles and characters.

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:22.342
In order for us to build safely,

00:07:22.366 --> 00:07:24.542
we've engineered these
buildings, actually,

00:07:24.566 --> 00:07:26.262
to work in a Vancouver context,

00:07:26.286 --> 00:07:27.810
where we're a high seismic zone,

00:07:27.834 --> 00:07:30.981
even at 30 stories tall.

00:07:31.005 --> 00:07:32.903
Now obviously, every time I bring this up,

00:07:32.927 --> 00:07:34.867
people even, you know, here
at the conference, say,

00:07:34.891 --> 00:07:37.844
"Are you serious? Thirty stories?
How's that going to happen?"

00:07:37.868 --> 00:07:41.251
And there's a lot of really
good questions that are asked

00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:43.058
and important questions
that we spent quite a long time

00:07:43.082 --> 00:07:45.437
working on the answers
to as we put together

00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:48.010
our report and the peer reviewed report.

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.594
I'm just going to focus on a few of them,

00:07:49.618 --> 00:07:51.103
and let's start with fire,
because I think fire

00:07:51.127 --> 00:07:54.318
is probably the first one that you're
all thinking about right now.

00:07:54.342 --> 00:07:54.921
Fair enough.

00:07:54.945 --> 00:07:56.614
And the way I describe it is this.

00:07:56.638 --> 00:07:58.809
If I asked you to take
a match and light it

00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:02.797
and hold up a log and try
to get that log to go on fire,

00:08:02.821 --> 00:08:04.596
it doesn't happen, right?
We all know that.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.369
But to build a fire, you kind
of start with small pieces

00:08:07.393 --> 00:08:08.965
of wood and you work your way up,

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:11.612
and eventually you can
add the log to the fire,

00:08:11.636 --> 00:08:14.065
and when you do add the log
to the fire, of course,

00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:16.597
it burns, but it burns slowly.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.717
Well, mass timber panels,
these new products

00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:20.964
that we're using, are much like the log.

00:08:20.988 --> 00:08:23.659
It's hard to start them
on fire, and when they do,

00:08:23.683 --> 00:08:26.276
they actually burn
extraordinarily predictably,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.628
and we can use fire science
in order to predict

00:08:28.652 --> 00:08:30.748
and make these buildings
as safe as concrete

00:08:30.772 --> 00:08:33.336
and as safe as steel.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.101
The next big issue, deforestation.

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:38.571
Eighteen percent of our contribution

00:08:38.595 --> 00:08:40.656
to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.157
is the result of deforestation.

00:08:42.181 --> 00:08:45.599
The last thing we want
to do is cut down trees.

00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:49.796
Or, the last thing we want to do
is cut down the wrong trees.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.738
There are models for sustainable forestry

00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:54.909
that allow us to cut trees properly,

00:08:54.933 --> 00:08:56.838
and those are the only trees appropriate

00:08:56.862 --> 00:08:58.559
to use for these kinds of systems.

00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:00.688
Now I actually think that these ideas

00:09:00.712 --> 00:09:04.266
will change the economics
of deforestation.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.367
In countries with deforestation issues,

00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:08.851
we need to find a way to provide

00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:11.317
better value for the forest

00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:13.701
and actually encourage
people to make money

00:09:13.725 --> 00:09:15.579
through very fast growth cycles --

00:09:15.603 --> 00:09:18.550
10-, 12-, 15-year-old trees
that make these products

00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:20.949
and allow us to build at this scale.

00:09:20.973 --> 00:09:23.150
We've calculated a 20-story building:

00:09:23.174 --> 00:09:26.437
We'll grow enough wood in North
America every 13 minutes.

00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:28.879
That's how much it takes.

00:09:28.903 --> 00:09:31.648
The carbon story here
is a really good one.

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:35.250
If we built a 20-story building
out of cement and concrete,

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:37.723
the process would result
in the manufacturing

00:09:37.747 --> 00:09:41.688
of that cement and 1,200
tonnes of carbon dioxide.

00:09:41.712 --> 00:09:43.992
If we did it in wood, in this solution,

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:45.895
we'd sequester about 3,100 tonnes,

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.595
for a net difference of 4,300 tonnes.

00:09:48.619 --> 00:09:51.272
That's the equivalent of about 900 cars

00:09:51.296 --> 00:09:54.009
removed from the road in one year.

00:09:54.033 --> 00:09:55.891
Think back to that three billion people

00:09:55.915 --> 00:09:57.130
that need a new home,

00:09:57.154 --> 00:10:00.202
and maybe this
is a contributor to reducing.

00:10:00.226 --> 00:10:02.883
We're at the beginning
of a revolution, I hope,

00:10:02.907 --> 00:10:05.479
in the way we build, because this
is the first new way

00:10:05.503 --> 00:10:09.908
to build a skyscraper
in probably 100 years or more.

00:10:09.932 --> 00:10:12.431
But the challenge is changing
society's perception

00:10:12.455 --> 00:10:14.455
of possibility, and it's a huge challenge.

00:10:14.479 --> 00:10:17.964
The engineering is, truthfully,
the easy part of this.

00:10:17.988 --> 00:10:19.981
And the way I describe it is this.

00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:22.141
The first skyscraper, technically --

00:10:22.165 --> 00:10:24.691
and the definition of a skyscraper is 10
stories tall, believe it or not —

00:10:24.715 --> 00:10:27.049
but the first skyscraper
was this one in Chicago,

00:10:27.073 --> 00:10:30.004
and people were terrified to walk
underneath this building.

00:10:30.028 --> 00:10:31.944
But only four years after it was built,

00:10:31.968 --> 00:10:34.570
Gustave Eiffel was building
the Eiffel Tower,

00:10:34.594 --> 00:10:36.166
and as he built the Eiffel Tower,

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.773
he changed the skylines
of the cities of the world,

00:10:40.797 --> 00:10:43.845
changed and created a competition

00:10:43.869 --> 00:10:46.060
between places like New
York City and Chicago,

00:10:46.084 --> 00:10:48.989
where developers started building
bigger and bigger buildings

00:10:49.013 --> 00:10:52.270
and pushing the envelope
up higher and higher

00:10:52.294 --> 00:10:54.370
with better and better engineering.

00:10:54.394 --> 00:10:56.404
We built this model in New York, actually,

00:10:56.428 --> 00:10:59.191
as a theoretical model on the campus

00:10:59.215 --> 00:11:01.539
of a technical university soon to come,

00:11:01.563 --> 00:11:03.390
and the reason we picked this site

00:11:03.414 --> 00:11:06.127
to just show you what these
buildings may look like,

00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:07.914
because the exterior can change.

00:11:07.938 --> 00:11:10.647
It's really just the structure
that we're talking about.

00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:13.814
The reason we picked it is because this
is a technical university,

00:11:13.838 --> 00:11:15.656
and I believe that wood is the most

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.296
technologically advanced
material I can build with.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.097
It just happens to be that Mother
Nature holds the patent,

00:11:22.121 --> 00:11:24.788
and we don't really feel
comfortable with it.

00:11:24.812 --> 00:11:26.632
But that's the way it should be,

00:11:26.656 --> 00:11:30.427
nature's fingerprints
in the built environment.

00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:32.346
I'm looking for this opportunity

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.536
to create an Eiffel Tower
moment, we call it.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.576
Buildings are starting
to go up around the world.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.457
There's a building in London
that's nine stories,

00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:41.840
a new building that just
finished in Australia

00:11:41.864 --> 00:11:43.797
that I believe is 10 or 11.

00:11:43.821 --> 00:11:47.344
We're starting to push the height
up of these wood buildings,

00:11:47.368 --> 00:11:49.149
and we're hoping, and I'm hoping,

00:11:49.173 --> 00:11:52.161
that my hometown of Vancouver
actually potentially

00:11:52.185 --> 00:11:54.831
announces the world's tallest
at around 20 stories

00:11:54.855 --> 00:11:57.514
in the not-so-distant future.

00:11:57.538 --> 00:12:00.244
That Eiffel Tower moment
will break the ceiling,

00:12:00.268 --> 00:12:01.935
these arbitrary ceilings of height,

00:12:01.959 --> 00:12:04.627
and allow wood buildings
to join the competition.

00:12:04.651 --> 00:12:06.592
And I believe the race is ultimately on.

00:12:06.616 --> 00:12:08.042
Thank you.

00:12:08.066 --> 00:12:13.328
(Applause)
