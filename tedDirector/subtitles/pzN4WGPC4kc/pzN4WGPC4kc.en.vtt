00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:18.518
If you want to buy high-quality,
low-price cocaine,

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:21.379
there really is only one place to go,

00:00:21.403 --> 00:00:24.882
and that is the dark net
anonymous markets.

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:27.288
Now, you can't get to these sites

00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:31.775
with a normal browser --
Chrome or Firefox --

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:34.932
because they're on this
hidden part of the Internet,

00:00:34.956 --> 00:00:37.058
known as Tor hidden services,

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:41.775
where URLs are a string of meaningless
numbers and letters that end in .onion,

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:44.605
and which you access
with a special browser

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.074
called the Tor browser.

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:51.375
Now, the Tor browser was originally
a U.S. Naval intelligence project.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.280
It then became open source,

00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:55.891
and it allows anybody to browse the net

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:58.367
without giving away their location.

00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:02.495
And it does this
by encrypting your IP address

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.295
and then routing it via several
other computers around the world

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:08.658
that use the same software.

00:01:09.508 --> 00:01:11.775
You can use it on the normal Internet,

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.514
but it's also your key to the dark net.

00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:19.508
And because of this fiendishly
clever encryption system,

00:01:19.532 --> 00:01:24.951
the 20 or 30 -- we don't know exactly --
thousand sites that operate there

00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:28.182
are incredibly difficult to shut down.

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:34.095
It is a censorship-free world
visited by anonymous users.

00:01:35.268 --> 00:01:39.586
Little wonder, then,
that it's a natural place to go

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.522
for anybody with something to hide,

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:46.137
and that something, of course,
need not be illegal.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.638
On the dark net, you will find

00:01:48.662 --> 00:01:50.900
whistle-blower sites, The New Yorker.

00:01:51.225 --> 00:01:53.711
You will find political activism blogs.

00:01:53.735 --> 00:01:56.843
You will find libraries of pirated books.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:02:00.490
But you'll also find the drugs markets,

00:02:00.514 --> 00:02:04.619
illegal pornography,
commercial hacking services,

00:02:04.643 --> 00:02:06.240
and much more besides.

00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:12.074
Now, the dark net is one of the most
interesting, exciting places

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:13.775
anywhere on the net.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.475
And the reason is, because
although innovation, of course,

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.775
takes place in big businesses,

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.198
takes place in world-class universities,

00:02:22.222 --> 00:02:24.775
it also takes place in the fringes,

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.342
because those on the fringes --
the pariahs, the outcasts --

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:32.603
they're often the most creative,
because they have to be.

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.052
In this part of the Internet,

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:38.355
you will not find a single lolcat,

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.560
a single pop-up advert anywhere.

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.862
And that's one of the reasons why I think

00:02:43.886 --> 00:02:47.575
many of you here will be
on the dark net fairly soon.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.599
(Laughter)

00:02:50.177 --> 00:02:53.469
Not that I'm suggesting
anyone in this audience would use it

00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:55.770
to go and procure high-quality narcotics.

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:58.390
But let's say for a moment that you were.

00:02:58.414 --> 00:02:59.987
(Laughter)

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.591
Bear with me.

00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:07.444
The first thing you will notice
on signing up to one of these sites

00:03:07.468 --> 00:03:09.053
is how familiar it looks.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.265
Every single product --

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:15.153
thousands of products --

00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:19.193
has a glossy, high-res image,

00:03:19.217 --> 00:03:22.065
a detailed product description, a price.

00:03:22.414 --> 00:03:25.494
There's a "Proceed to checkout" icon.

00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:28.276
There is even, most beautifully of all,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.458
a "Report this item" button.

00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:33.189
(Laughter)

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.139
Incredible.

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:37.550
You browse through the site,
you make your choice,

00:03:37.574 --> 00:03:39.993
you pay with the crypto-currency bitcoin,

00:03:40.017 --> 00:03:43.046
you enter an address -- 
preferably not your home address --

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.775
and you wait for your product
to arrive in the post,

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.662
which it nearly always does.

00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:53.139
And the reason it does
is not because of the clever encryption.

00:03:53.163 --> 00:03:54.328
That's important.

00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:58.003
Something far simpler than that.

00:03:58.027 --> 00:03:59.252
It's the user reviews.

00:03:59.944 --> 00:04:01.259
(Laughter)

00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:05.054
You see, every single vendor
on these sites

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.396
uses a pseudonym, naturally enough,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.213
but they keep the same pseudonym
to build up a reputation.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.910
And because it's easy for the buyer
to change allegiance whenever they want,

00:04:16.934 --> 00:04:21.207
the only way of trusting a vendor

00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:24.869
is if they have a good history
of positive feedback

00:04:24.893 --> 00:04:26.483
from other users of the site.

00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:31.873
And this introduction
of competition and choice

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:36.166
does exactly what
the economists would predict.

00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:42.032
Prices tend to go down,
product quality tends to go up,

00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:44.429
and the vendors are attentive,

00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:46.884
they're polite, they're consumer-centric,

00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:51.220
offering you all manner
of special deals, one-offs,

00:04:51.244 --> 00:04:54.415
buy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery,

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.623
to keep you happy.

00:04:56.953 --> 00:04:59.871
I spoke to Drugsheaven.

00:04:59.895 --> 00:05:05.785
Drugsheaven was offering
excellent and consistent marijuana

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:07.351
at a reasonable price.

00:05:08.154 --> 00:05:11.963
He had a very generous refund policy,

00:05:11.987 --> 00:05:13.775
detailed T's and C's,

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:15.211
and good shipping times.

00:05:15.608 --> 00:05:17.869
"Dear Drugsheaven," I wrote,

00:05:17.893 --> 00:05:21.707
via the internal emailing system
that's also encrypted, of course.

00:05:22.397 --> 00:05:26.538
"I'm new here. Do you mind
if I buy just one gram of marijuana?"

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.574
A couple of hours later, I get a reply.

00:05:29.598 --> 00:05:30.784
They always reply.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.026
"Hi there, thanks for your email.

00:05:34.154 --> 00:05:39.422
Starting small is a wise thing to do.
I would, too, if I were you."

00:05:39.446 --> 00:05:41.208
(Laughter)

00:05:41.232 --> 00:05:44.353
"So no problem if you'd like to start
with just one gram.

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:46.888
I do hope we can do business together.

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:48.775
Best wishes, Drugsheaven."

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:50.775
(Laughter)

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:54.063
I don't know why he had a posh
English accent, but I assume he did.

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:00.775
Now, this kind
of consumer-centric attitude

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:06.235
is the reason why, when I reviewed
120,000 pieces of feedback

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.239
that had been left on one of these sites
over a three-month period,

00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:13.392
95 percent of them were five out of five.

00:06:14.563 --> 00:06:17.104
The customer, you see, is king.

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:19.009
But what does that mean?

00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:20.974
Well, on the one hand,

00:06:20.998 --> 00:06:25.032
that means there are more drugs,
more available, more easily,

00:06:25.056 --> 00:06:26.207
to more people.

00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:29.729
And by my reckoning,
that is not a good thing.

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:34.512
But, on the other hand,
if you are going to take drugs,

00:06:34.536 --> 00:06:37.597
you have a reasonably good way

00:06:37.621 --> 00:06:42.035
of guaranteeing a certain level
of purity and quality,

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:45.775
which is incredibly important
if you're taking drugs.

00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:48.917
And you can do so
from the comfort of your own home,

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:53.128
without the risks associated
with buying on the streets.

00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:55.437
Now, as I said,

00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:59.563
you've got to be creative and innovative
to survive in this marketplace.

00:07:00.277 --> 00:07:03.371
And the 20 or so sites
that are currently in operation --

00:07:03.395 --> 00:07:07.100
by the way, they don't always work,
they're not always perfect;

00:07:07.124 --> 00:07:09.726
the site that I showed you
was shut down 18 months ago,

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.901
but not before it had turned
over a billion dollars' worth of trade.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.623
But these markets,

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:21.709
because of the difficult conditions
in which they are operating,

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.221
the inhospitable conditions,

00:07:23.245 --> 00:07:26.593
are always innovating, always
thinking of ways of getting smarter,

00:07:26.617 --> 00:07:28.855
more decentralized, harder to censor,

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:31.235
and more customer-friendly.

00:07:32.346 --> 00:07:33.775
Let's take the payment system.

00:07:34.383 --> 00:07:36.181
You don't pay with your credit card,

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:38.550
of course -- that would lead
directly back to you.

00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:40.551
So you use the crypto-currency bitcoin,

00:07:40.575 --> 00:07:45.030
which is easily exchanged
for real-world currencies

00:07:45.054 --> 00:07:48.799
and gives quite a high degree
of anonymity to its users.

00:07:49.367 --> 00:07:52.294
But at the beginning of these sites,
people noticed a flaw.

00:07:52.318 --> 00:07:56.383
Some of the unscrupulous dealers
were running away with peoples' bitcoin

00:07:56.407 --> 00:07:58.212
before they'd mailed the drugs out.

00:07:59.155 --> 00:08:05.050
The community came up with a solution,
called multi-signature escrow payments.

00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:10.628
So on purchasing my item,

00:08:10.652 --> 00:08:13.678
I would send my bitcoin

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:17.994
to a neutral, secure third digital wallet.

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:21.388
The vendor, who would see
that I'd sent it,

00:08:21.412 --> 00:08:24.368
would be confident that they
could then send the product to me,

00:08:24.392 --> 00:08:25.775
and then when I received it,

00:08:25.799 --> 00:08:28.775
at least two of the three people
engaged in the transaction --

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:31.339
vendor, buyer, site administrator --

00:08:31.363 --> 00:08:33.775
would have to sign the transaction off

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.877
with a unique digital signature,

00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:37.876
and then the money would be transferred.

00:08:38.263 --> 00:08:39.563
Brilliant!

00:08:39.587 --> 00:08:40.738
Elegant.

00:08:40.762 --> 00:08:41.913
It works.

00:08:42.877 --> 00:08:45.528
But then they realized there was
a problem with bitcoin,

00:08:45.552 --> 00:08:47.253
because every bitcoin transaction

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.775
is actually recorded publicly
in a public ledger.

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:53.076
So if you're clever, you can try
and work out who's behind them.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.385
So they came up with a tumbling service.

00:08:56.409 --> 00:08:59.800
Hundreds of people send
their bitcoin into one address,

00:08:59.824 --> 00:09:01.799
they're tumbled and jumbled up,

00:09:01.823 --> 00:09:05.613
and then the right amount
is sent on to the right recipients,

00:09:05.637 --> 00:09:07.459
but they're different bitcoins:

00:09:07.483 --> 00:09:09.173
micro-laundering systems.

00:09:09.197 --> 00:09:10.731
(Laughter)

00:09:10.755 --> 00:09:11.911
It's incredible.

00:09:11.935 --> 00:09:17.128
Interested in what drugs are trending
right now on the dark net markets?

00:09:17.152 --> 00:09:19.229
Check Grams, the search engine.

00:09:19.253 --> 00:09:21.418
You can even buy some advertising space.

00:09:21.442 --> 00:09:23.507
(Laughter)

00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:28.469
Are you an ethical consumer worried
about what the drugs industry is doing?

00:09:29.064 --> 00:09:30.215
Yeah.

00:09:30.592 --> 00:09:33.986
One vendor will offer you
fair trade organic cocaine.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.152
(Laughter)

00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:38.471
That's not being sourced
from Colombian druglords,

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:39.924
but Guatemalan farmers.

00:09:39.948 --> 00:09:43.260
They even promised to reinvest
20 percent of any profits

00:09:43.284 --> 00:09:45.074
into local education programs.

00:09:45.098 --> 00:09:46.120
(Laughter)

00:09:46.144 --> 00:09:48.123
There's even a mystery shopper.

00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:52.320
Now, whatever you think
about the morality of these sites --

00:09:52.344 --> 00:09:55.659
and I submit that it's not
actually an easy question --

00:09:55.683 --> 00:10:01.185
the creation of functioning,
competitive, anonymous markets,

00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:03.775
where nobody knows who anybody else is,

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:06.898
constantly at risk of being shut down
by the authorities,

00:10:06.922 --> 00:10:09.456
is a staggering achievement,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.518
a phenomenal achievement.

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:15.993
And it's that kind of innovation

00:10:16.017 --> 00:10:18.775
that's why those on the fringes

00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:21.646
are often the harbingers
of what is to come.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.464
It's easy to forget

00:10:24.488 --> 00:10:26.550
that because of its short life,

00:10:26.574 --> 00:10:30.221
the Internet has actually
changed many times

00:10:30.245 --> 00:10:31.775
over the last 30 years or so.

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:34.775
It started in the '70s
as a military project,

00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:38.775
morphed in the 1980s
to an academic network,

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:41.261
co-opted by commercial
companies in the '90s,

00:10:41.285 --> 00:10:44.740
and then invaded by all of us
via social media in the noughties,

00:10:44.764 --> 00:10:46.693
but I think it's going to change again.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:49.775
And I think things
like the dark net markets --

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:53.775
creative, secure, difficult to censor --

00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:55.401
I think that's the future.

00:10:56.929 --> 00:10:58.557
And the reason it's the future

00:10:58.581 --> 00:11:01.249
is because we're all worried
about our privacy.

00:11:01.273 --> 00:11:04.498
Surveys consistently show
concerns about privacy.

00:11:04.522 --> 00:11:08.481
The more time we spend online,
the more we worry about them,

00:11:08.505 --> 00:11:10.775
and those surveys show
our worries are growing.

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:12.915
We're worried about
what happens to our data.

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:15.048
We're worried about
who might be watching us.

00:11:15.072 --> 00:11:17.640
Since the revelations from Edward Snowden,

00:11:17.664 --> 00:11:20.110
there's been a huge increase
in the number of people

00:11:20.134 --> 00:11:23.226
using various privacy-enhancing tools.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.487
There are now between two
and three million daily users

00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:27.786
of the Tor browser,

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.977
the majority of which use
is perfectly legitimate,

00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:34.760
sometimes even mundane.

00:11:35.658 --> 00:11:38.809
And there are hundreds of activists
around the world

00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:44.099
working on techniques and tools
to keep you private online --

00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:47.592
default encrypted messaging services.

00:11:47.616 --> 00:11:51.639
Ethereum, which is a project
which tries to link up

00:11:51.663 --> 00:11:56.741
the connected but unused hard drives
of millions of computers around the world,

00:11:56.765 --> 00:12:00.636
to create a sort of distributed Internet
that no one really controls.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.553
Now, we've had distributed
computing before, of course.

00:12:03.577 --> 00:12:07.775
We use it for everything from Skype
to the search for extraterrestrial life.

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:12.288
But you add distributed computing
and powerful encryption --

00:12:12.312 --> 00:12:16.199
that's very, very hard
to censor and control.

00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:19.438
Another called MaidSafe
works on similar principles.

00:12:19.462 --> 00:12:22.910
Another called Twister,
and so on and so on.

00:12:23.396 --> 00:12:25.386
And here's the thing --

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:26.874
the more of us join,

00:12:26.898 --> 00:12:29.349
the more interesting those sites become,

00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:31.861
and then the more of us join, and so on.

00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:34.293
And I think that's what's going to happen.

00:12:34.317 --> 00:12:36.465
In fact, it's already happening.

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:40.365
The dark net is no longer
a den for dealers

00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:42.956
and a hideout for whistle-blowers.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.667
It's already going mainstream.

00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:52.272
Just recently, the musician Aphex Twin
released his album as a dark net site.

00:12:52.296 --> 00:12:56.249
Facebook has started a dark net site.

00:12:56.273 --> 00:12:59.906
A group of London architects
have opened a dark net site

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.775
for people worried
about regeneration projects.

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:05.372
Yes, the dark net is going mainstream,

00:13:05.396 --> 00:13:09.013
and I predict that fairly soon,
every social media company,

00:13:09.037 --> 00:13:10.472
every major news outlet,

00:13:10.496 --> 00:13:13.580
and therefore most of you
in this audience,

00:13:13.604 --> 00:13:15.960
will be using the dark net, too.

00:13:16.942 --> 00:13:19.971
So the Internet is about to get
more interesting,

00:13:19.995 --> 00:13:22.775
more exciting, more innovative,

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:24.524
more terrible,

00:13:24.548 --> 00:13:25.902
more destructive.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.413
That's good news
if you care about liberty.

00:13:29.437 --> 00:13:31.407
It's good news if you care about freedom.

00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:33.550
It's good news if you care
about democracy.

00:13:33.574 --> 00:13:34.952
It's also good news

00:13:34.976 --> 00:13:37.422
if you want to browse
for illegal pornography

00:13:37.446 --> 00:13:39.775
and if you want to buy and sell drugs

00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:41.092
with impunity.

00:13:41.876 --> 00:13:45.775
Neither entirely dark, nor entirely light.

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:49.476
It's not one side or the other
that's going to win out, but both.

00:13:50.352 --> 00:13:52.240
Thank you very much, indeed.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.950
(Applause)
