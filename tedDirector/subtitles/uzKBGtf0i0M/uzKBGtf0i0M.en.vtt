00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Embracing otherness.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
When I first heard this theme,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I thought, well, embracing otherness

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
is embracing myself.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And the journey to that place

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
of understanding and acceptance

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
has been an interesting one for me,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and it's given me an insight

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
into the whole notion of self,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.260
which I think is worth sharing with you today.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
We each have a self,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
but I don't think that we're born with one.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
You know how newborn babies

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
believe they're part of everything;

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
they're not separate?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Well that fundamental sense of oneness

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
is lost on us very quickly.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
It's like that initial stage is over --

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
oneness: infancy,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
unformed, primitive.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
It's no longer valid or real.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
What is real is separateness,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and at some point in early babyhood,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
the idea of self

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
starts to form.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Our little portion of oneness is given a name,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
is told all kinds of things about itself,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
and these details,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
opinions and ideas

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
become facts,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
which go towards building ourselves,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
our identity.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And that self becomes the vehicle

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
for navigating our social world.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
But the self is a projection

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
based on other people's projections.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Is it who we really are?

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Or who we really want to be, or should be?

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
So this whole interaction

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
with self and identity

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
was a very difficult one for me growing up.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
The self that I attempted to take out into the world

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
was rejected over and over again.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And my panic

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
at not having a self that fit,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and the confusion that came

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
from my self being rejected,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
created anxiety, shame

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and hopelessness,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
which kind of defined me for a long time.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
But in retrospect,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
the destruction of my self was so repetitive

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
that I started to see a pattern.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
The self changed,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
got affected, broken, destroyed,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
but another one would evolve --

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
sometimes stronger,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
sometimes hateful,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
sometimes not wanting to be there at all.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
The self was not constant.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And how many times

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
would my self have to die

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
before I realized

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
that it was never alive in the first place?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
I grew up on the coast of England

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
in the '70s.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
My dad is white from Cornwall,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and my mom is black from Zimbabwe.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Even the idea of us as a family

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
was challenging to most people.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
But nature had its wicked way,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and brown babies were born.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
But from about the age of five,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
I was aware that I didn't fit.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
I was the black atheist kid

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
I was an anomaly,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and my self was rooting around for definition

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
and trying to plug in.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Because the self likes to fit,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
to see itself replicated,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
to belong.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
That confirms its existence

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
and its importance.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And it is important.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
It has an extremely important function.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Without it, we literally can't interface with others.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
We can't hatch plans

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
and climb that stairway of popularity,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
of success.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
But my skin color wasn't right.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
My hair wasn't right.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
My history wasn't right.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
My self became defined

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
by otherness,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
which meant that, in that social world,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
I didn't really exist.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And I was "other" before being anything else --

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
even before being a girl.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
I was a noticeable nobody.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Another world was opening up

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
around this time:

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
performance and dancing.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
That nagging dread of self-hood

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
didn't exist when I was dancing.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
I'd literally lose myself.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And I was a really good dancer.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
I would put

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
all my emotional expression

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
into my dancing.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
I could be in the movement

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
in a way that I wasn't able to be

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
in my real life, in myself.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And at 16,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
I stumbled across another opportunity,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and I earned my first acting role in a film.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
I can hardly find the words

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
to describe the peace I felt

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
when I was acting.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
My dysfunctional self

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
could actually plug in

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
to another self, not my own,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
and it felt so good.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
It was the first time that I existed

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
inside a fully-functioning self --

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
one that I controlled,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
that I steered,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
that I gave life to.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
But the shooting day would end,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and I'd return

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
to my gnarly, awkward self.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
By 19,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
I was a fully-fledged movie actor,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
but still searching for definition.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
I applied to read anthropology

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
at university.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Dr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and she asked me, "How would you define race?"

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
Well, I thought I had the answer to that one,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and I said, "Skin color."

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.260
"So biology, genetics?" she said.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
"Because, Thandie, that's not accurate.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
Because there's actually more genetic difference

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
between a black Kenyan

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
and a black Ugandan

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
than there is between a black Kenyan

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
and, say, a white Norwegian.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Because we all stem from Africa.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
So in Africa,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
there's been more time

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
to create genetic diversity."

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
In other words,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
race has no basis

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
in biological or scientific fact.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
On the one hand, result.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
Right?

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
On the other hand, my definition of self

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
just lost a huge chunk of its credibility.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
But what was credible,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
what is biological and scientific fact,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
is that we all stem from Africa --

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
in fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
who lived 160,000 years ago.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And race is an illegitimate concept

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
which our selves have created

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.260
based on fear and ignorance.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
Strangely, these revelations

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
didn't cure my low self-esteem,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
that feeling of otherness.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
My desire to disappear

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
was still very powerful.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
I had a degree from Cambridge;

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
I had a thriving career,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
but my self was a car crash,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and I wound up with bulimia

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
and on a therapist's couch.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
And of course I did.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
I still believed

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
my self was all I was.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
I still valued self-worth

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
above all other worth,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
and what was there to suggest otherwise?

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
We've created entire value systems

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
and a physical reality

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
to support the worth of self.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Look at the industry for self-image

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and the jobs it creates,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
the revenue it turns over.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
We'd be right in assuming

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
that the self is an actual living thing.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
But it's not. It's a projection

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
which our clever brains create

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
in order to cheat ourselves

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
from the reality of death.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
But there is something

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
that can give the self

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
ultimate and infinite connection --

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
and that thing is oneness,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
our essence.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
The self's struggle

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
for authenticity and definition

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
will never end

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
unless it's connected to its creator --

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
to you and to me.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And that can happen with awareness --

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
awareness of the reality of oneness

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
and the projection of self-hood.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
For a start, we can think about

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
all the times when we do lose ourselves.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
It happens when I dance,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
when I'm acting.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
I'm earthed in my essence,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
and my self is suspended.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
In those moments,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
I'm connected to everything --

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
the ground, the air,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
the sounds, the energy from the audience.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.260
All my senses are alert and alive

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
in much the same way as an infant might feel --

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
that feeling of oneness.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
And when I'm acting a role,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
I inhabit another self,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
and I give it life for awhile,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
because when the self is suspended

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
so is divisiveness

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
and judgment.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And I've played everything

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.260
to Secretary of State in 2004.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
And no matter how other

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
these selves might be,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.260
they're all related in me.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
And I honestly believe

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
the key to my success as an actor

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
and my progress as a person

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
has been the very lack of self

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
that used to make me feel

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
so anxious and insecure.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
I always wondered

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.260
why I could feel others' pain so deeply,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
why I could recognize

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
the somebody in the nobody.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.260
It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
I thought I lacked substance,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and the fact that I could feel others'

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
The thing that was a source of shame

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
was actually a source of enlightenment.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
And when I realized

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and really understood

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
that my self is a projection and that it has a function,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
a funny thing happened.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
I stopped giving it so much authority.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
I give it its due.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
I take it to therapy.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
I've become very familiar

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
with its dysfunctional behavior.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
But I'm not ashamed of my self.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
In fact, I respect my self

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
and its function.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
And over time and with practice,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
I've tried to live

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
more and more from my essence.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
And if you can do that,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
incredible things happen.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
I was in Congo in February,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
dancing and celebrating

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
with women who've survived

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
the destruction of their selves

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
in literally unthinkable ways --

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
all over that beautiful land

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
are fueling our selves' addiction

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
to iPods, Pads, and bling,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
which further disconnect ourselves

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
from ever feeling their pain,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
their suffering,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
their death.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
Because, hey,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
if we're all living in ourselves

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
and mistaking it for life,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
then we're devaluing

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
and desensitizing life.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
And in that disconnected state,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.260
yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
destroy marine life

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
and use rape as a weapon of war.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
So here's a note to self:

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
The cracks have started to show

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
in our constructed world,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
and oceans will continue

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
to surge through the cracks,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
and oil and blood,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
rivers of it.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Crucially, we haven't been figuring out

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
how to live in oneness

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
with the Earth and every other living thing.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
We've just been insanely trying to figure out

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
how to live with each other -- billions of each other.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Only we're not living with each other;

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
our crazy selves are living with each other

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
and perpetuating an epidemic

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
of disconnection.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
Let's live with each other

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
and take it a breath at a time.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.260
If we can get under that heavy self,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
light a torch of awareness,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
and find our essence,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
our connection to the infinite

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
and every other living thing.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
We knew it from the day we were born.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Let's not be freaked out

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
by our bountiful nothingness.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
It's more a reality

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
than the ones our selves have created.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.260
Imagine what kind of existence we can have

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.260
if we honor inevitable death of self,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.260
appreciate the privilege of life

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.260
and marvel at what comes next.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Simple awareness is where it begins.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
Thank you for listening.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:49.260
(Applause)
