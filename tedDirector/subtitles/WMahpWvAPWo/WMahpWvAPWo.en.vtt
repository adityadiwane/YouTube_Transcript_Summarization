Reviewer: Sebastian Betti

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.460
My name is Emiliano Salinas

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.660
and I'm going to talk about the role

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.760
we members of society play

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.060
in the violent atmosphere

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.390
this country is living in right now.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.460
I was born in 1976.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.860
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.860
As a child, I had a pretty normal life:

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.960
I would go to school, play with my friends and cousins.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.260
But then my father became President of Mexico

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.760
and my life changed.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.060
What I'm about to say,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.560
at least some of what I'm about to say,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.360
will cause controversy.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.460
Firstly, because I'm the one who's going to say it.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.460
And secondly, because what I'm going to say is true,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.460
and it will make a lot of people nervous

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.110
because it's something we don't want to hear.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.160
But it's imperative that we listen

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.518
because it's undeniable and definitive.

00:01:07.518 --> 00:01:09.260
It will also make members of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.195
criminal organizations nervous

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.960
for the same reasons.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.160
I'm going to talk about the role

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.998
we members of society play

00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:19.560
in this phenomenon,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.260
and about four different response levels

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.560
we citizens have against violence.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.760
I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.660
that I'm Carlos Salinas de Gortari's son

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.460
from the fact that I'm a citizen

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.260
concerned about the country's current situation.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.460
Don't worry.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.460
It's not necessary for understanding

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.960
the importance of what I'm going to say.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.660
I think we have a problem in Mexico.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.960
We have a big problem.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960
I think there's consensus on this.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.960
No one argues --

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.260
we all agree there's a problem.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.760
What we don't agree on

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.060
is what the problem actually is.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.760
Is it the Zetas? The drug traffickers? The government?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.960
Corruption? Poverty? Or is it something else?

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.160
I think none of these is the problem.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.460
I don't mean they don't deserve attention.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.930
But we won't be able to take care of any of those things

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.060
if we don't solve the real problem

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.560
we have in Mexico first.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.950
The real problem we have is

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.160
most of us Mexicans, we believe we are victims

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.906
of our circumstances.

00:02:17.906 --> 00:02:20.260
We are a country of victims.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.010
Historically, we've always acted as victims

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.780
of something or somebody.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.060
We were victims of the Spaniards.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.080
Then we were victims of the French.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.524
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio.

00:02:31.524 --> 00:02:33.676
Then we were victims of the PRI.

00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:35.360
Even of Salinas.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.481
And of El Peje.

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.467
And now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:42.947
Hold on! Wait a minute!

00:02:42.947 --> 00:02:46.482
What if none of these things is the problem?

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:49.785
The problem is not the things we feel victims of.

00:02:49.785 --> 00:02:53.985
The problem is that we play the role of victims.

00:02:53.985 --> 00:02:57.760
We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.960
If only we stopped feeling like victims,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.260
if we stopped acting as victims,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.482
our country would change so much!

00:03:04.495 --> 00:03:07.960
I'm going to talk about how to go from a society

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.659
that acts as a victim of circumstances

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.560
to a responsible, involved society

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.096
that takes the future of its country in its own hands.

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:18.560
I'm going to talk about four different levels

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.660
of civil response against violence,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.960
from weakest

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.260
to strongest.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.760
The first level, the weakest level of civil response against violence,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.660
is denial and apathy.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.260
Today, much of Mexican society is in denial

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
of the situation we're going through.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.518
We want to go on with our daily life

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:41.060
even though we are not living under normal circumstances.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.760
Daily life in our country is,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.989
to say the least,

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.953
under extraordinary, exceptional circumstances.

00:03:48.953 --> 00:03:52.760
It's like someone who has a serious illness

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.760
and pretends it's the flu

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.730
and it will just go away.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.971
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu.

00:03:59.971 --> 00:04:02.073
But it doesn't.

00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:04.290
Mexico has cancer.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.460
And if we don't do something about it,

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.614
the cancer will end up killing it.

00:04:09.614 --> 00:04:12.060
We need to move Mexican society

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.060
from denial and apathy

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.460
to the next level of citizen response,

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.592
which is, effectively, recognition.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:23.426
And that recognition will sow fear --

00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:26.585
recognizing the seriousness of the situation.

00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:30.232
But, fear is better than apathy

00:04:30.232 --> 00:04:33.546
because fear makes us do something.

00:04:33.546 --> 00:04:36.789
Many people in Mexico

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.746
are afraid today.

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:40.222
We're very afraid.

00:04:40.222 --> 00:04:42.360
And we're acting out of that fear.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.060
And let me tell you what the problem is

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.760
with acting out of fear --

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.260
and this is the second level of civil response:

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.860
fear.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.260
Let's think about Mexican streets:

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.760
they're unsafe because of violence,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.260
so people stay at home.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.460
Does that make streets more or less safe?

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.460
Less safe!

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.260
So streets become more desolate and unsafe,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.660
so we stay home more --

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.060
which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe,

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.560
and we stay home even more.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.260
This vicious circle ends up with the whole population

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
stuck inside their houses, scared to death --

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.760
even more afraid than when we were out on the streets.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.260
We need to confront this fear.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.660
We need to move Mexican society,

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.260
the members of society who are at this level,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.460
to the next level, which is action.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.460
We need to face our fears and take back our streets,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.260
our cities, our neighborhoods.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.460
For many people, acting involves courage.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.460
We go from fear to courage.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.260
They say, "I can't take it anymore.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Let's do something about it."

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Recently --

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
this is a sensitive figure --

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.460
35 public lynchings have been recorded

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.060
so far in 2010

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.260
in Mexico.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.660
Usually it's one or two a year.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.260
Now we're experiencing one every week.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
This shows that society is desperate

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.760
and it's taking the law into its own hands.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.260
Unfortunately, violent action --

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
though action is better than no action --

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
but taking part in it

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.760
only disguises violence.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.260
If I'm violent with you

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
and you respond with violence,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
you become part of the violence

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and you just disguise my violence.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.460
So civil action

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.260
is vital,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
but it's also vital to take people

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.460
who are at the level of courage

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.260
and violent action

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
to the next level,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.860
which is non-violent action.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.760
It's pacific, coordinated civil action,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.760
which doesn't mean passive action.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.560
It means it's determined and effective,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.060
but not violent.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.760
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.460
Two years ago, in Galena City, Chihuahua,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.260
a member of the community was kidnapped,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.960
Eric Le Barón.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.560
His brothers, Benjamín and Julián,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.560
got together with the rest of the community

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.960
to think of the best course of action:

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.060
to pay the ransom,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.560
to take up arms and go after the kidnappers

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.860
or to ask the government for help.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.260
In the end, Benjamín and Julián decided

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
the best thing they could do

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.060
was to organize the community and act together.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.760
So what did they do?

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.060
They mobilized the whole community of Le Barón

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.860
to go to Chihuahua,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.260
where they organized a sit-in

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.560
in the central park of the city.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.460
They sent a message to the kidnappers:

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.460
"If you want your ransom come and get it.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.860
We'll be waiting for you right here."

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.860
They stayed there.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.360
Seven days later, Eric was set free

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.360
and was able to return home.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.160
This is an example of what an organized society can do,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.760
a society that acts.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.960
Of course, criminals can respond.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.960
And in this case, they did.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.260
On July 7th, 2009,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.760
Benjamín Le Barón was murdered.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.460
But Julián Le Barón keeps working

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.660
and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.260
for over a year.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.960
And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.760
But he keeps fighting.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.260
He keeps organizing.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
He keeps mobilizing.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.860
These heroic acts are present all over the country.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.260
With a thousand Juliáns working together,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
Mexico would be a very different country.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.760
And they're out there!

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.260
They just have to raise their hands.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:49.260
I was born in Mexico, I grew up in Mexico

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and along the way, I learned to love Mexico.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.460
I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land --

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.460
not to mention all Mexican people --

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.260
will agree that it's not difficult

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
to love Mexico.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.760
I've traveled a lot

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:13.260
and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
That devotion we feel

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
for the national football team.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
That devotion we show

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
in helping victims of disasters,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
such as the earthquake in 1985

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.760
or this year's floods.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.260
The passion with which we've been singing the national anthem

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.760
since we were kids.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.260
When we thought Masiosare

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
was the strange enemy,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.760
and we sang, with a childlike heart,

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.960
"a soldier in each son."

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.260
I think the biggest insult,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
the worst way you can offend a Mexican

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.060
is to insult their mother.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.260
A mother is the most sacred thing in life.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
Mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
We are going through the darkest moment

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
in our recent history.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.960
Our mother, Mexico, is being violated before our very eyes.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.960
What are we going to do?

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.460
Masiosare, the strange enemy, is here.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.260
Where is the soldier in each son?

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
Mahatma Gandhi,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.060
one of the greatest civil fighters of all time, said,

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.060
"Be the change you wish to see in the world."

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.260
Today in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.760
We need Gandhis.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.760
We need men and women who love Mexico

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.760
and who are willing to take action.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.760
This is a call for every true Mexican

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.760
to join this initiative.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.260
This is a call

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
so that every single thing we love about Mexico --

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
the festivals, the markets,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
the restaurants, the cantinas,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
the tequila, the mariachis, the serenades,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.060
the posadas, El Grito, the Day of the Dead,

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.460
San Miguel, the joy, the passion for life,

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.660
the fight and everything it means to be Mexican --

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.060
doesn't disappear from this world.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.260
We're facing a very powerful opponent.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.760
But we are many more.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.260
They can take a man's life.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Anyone can kill me,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.760
or you, or you.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.260
But no one can kill

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.760
the spirit of true Mexicans.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.760
The battle is won,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.660
but we still have to fight it.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:40.260
2000 years ago, the Roman poet Juvenal

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
said something that today echoes

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
in the heart of every true Mexican.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.560
He said, "Count it the greatest sin

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:56.260
to prefer life to honor,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and for the sake of living

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.860
to lose what makes life worth living."

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.260
Thank you.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
(Applause)
