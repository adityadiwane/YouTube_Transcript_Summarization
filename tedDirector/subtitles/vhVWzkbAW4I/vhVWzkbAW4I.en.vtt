00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:15.417
Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:18.968
are of spending time with my grandmother, Mamar,

00:00:18.968 --> 00:00:22.768
in our four-family home in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:22.768 --> 00:00:25.843
Her apartment was an oasis.

00:00:25.843 --> 00:00:27.888
It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee,

00:00:27.888 --> 00:00:31.769
which was really warm milk 
with just a touch of caffeine.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.303
She loved life.

00:00:34.303 --> 00:00:36.798
And although she worked in a factory,

00:00:36.798 --> 00:00:39.970
she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.299
And I remember poring over those pictures with her

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:47.411
and then dancing with her to her favorite music.

00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:52.033
And then, when I was eight and she was 60,

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.086
something changed.

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:56.440
She no longer worked or traveled.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.131
She no longer danced.

00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:00.884
There were no more coffee times.

00:01:00.884 --> 00:01:03.068
My mother missed work and took her to doctors

00:01:03.068 --> 00:01:05.454
who couldn't make a diagnosis.

00:01:05.454 --> 00:01:10.791
And my father, who worked at night, 
would spend every afternoon with her,

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:13.876
just to make sure she ate.

00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:18.576
Her care became all-consuming for our family.

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:20.223
And by the time a diagnosis was made,

00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:22.928
she was in a deep spiral.

00:01:22.928 --> 00:01:26.489
Now many of you will recognize her symptoms.

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:29.152
My grandmother had depression.

00:01:29.152 --> 00:01:32.472
A deep, life-altering depression,

00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:35.562
from which she never recovered.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:39.253
And back then, so little 
was known about depression.

00:01:39.253 --> 00:01:42.658
But even today, 50 years later,

00:01:42.658 --> 00:01:45.932
there's still so much more to learn.

00:01:45.932 --> 00:01:50.840
Today, we know that women 
are 70 percent more likely

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.831
to experience depression over their lifetimes

00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:56.112
compared with men.

00:01:56.112 --> 00:01:58.952
And even with this high prevalence,

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:05.239
women are misdiagnosed between 
30 and 50 percent of the time.

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.172
Now we know that women are more likely

00:02:08.172 --> 00:02:13.560
to experience the symptoms 
of fatigue, sleep disturbance,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.105
pain and anxiety compared with men.

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:18.804
And these symptoms are often overlooked

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:21.767
as symptoms of depression.

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:25.550
And it isn't only depression in which 
these sex differences occur,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.069
but they occur across so many diseases.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.064
So it's my grandmother's struggles

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:35.797
that have really led me on a lifelong quest.

00:02:35.797 --> 00:02:39.025
And today, I lead a center in which the mission

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:42.804
is to discover why these sex differences occur

00:02:42.804 --> 00:02:44.906
and to use that knowledge

00:02:44.906 --> 00:02:47.865
to improve the health of women.

00:02:47.865 --> 00:02:51.998
Today, we know that every cell has a sex.

00:02:51.998 --> 00:02:55.951
Now, that's a term coined 
by the Institute of Medicine.

00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:59.712
And what it means is that 
men and women are different

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:04.154
down to the cellular and molecular levels.

00:03:04.154 --> 00:03:09.094
It means that we're different 
across all of our organs.

00:03:09.094 --> 00:03:14.589
From our brains to our hearts, our lungs, our joints.

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:18.473
Now, it was only 20 years ago

00:03:18.473 --> 00:03:22.300
that we hardly had any data on women's health

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.183
beyond our reproductive functions.

00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:28.084
But then in 1993,

00:03:28.084 --> 00:03:32.696
the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law.

00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:35.299
And what this law did was it mandated

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.772
that women and minorities 
be included in clinical trials

00:03:39.772 --> 00:03:43.823
that were funded by the National Institutes of Health.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:46.750
And in many ways, the law has worked.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.420
Women are now routinely 
included in clinical studies,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.671
and we've learned that there are major differences

00:03:52.671 --> 00:03:54.764
in the ways that women and men

00:03:54.764 --> 00:03:57.300
experience disease.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.465
But remarkably,

00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:04.559
what we have learned about these 
differences is often overlooked.

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:08.384
So, we have to ask ourselves the question:

00:04:08.384 --> 00:04:12.897
Why leave women's health to chance?

00:04:12.897 --> 00:04:15.540
And we're leaving it to chance in two ways.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.237
The first is that there is so much more to learn

00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:21.646
and we're not making the investment

00:04:21.646 --> 00:04:25.814
in fully understanding the extent 
of these sex differences.

00:04:25.814 --> 00:04:30.536
And the second is that we aren't 
taking what we have learned,

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:34.240
and routinely applying it in clinical care.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.229
We are just not doing enough.

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.488
So, I'm going to share with you three examples

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:44.194
of where sex differences have 
impacted the health of women,

00:04:44.194 --> 00:04:46.864
and where we need to do more.

00:04:46.864 --> 00:04:48.876
Let's start with heart disease.

00:04:48.876 --> 00:04:54.078
It's the number one killer of women 
in the United States today.

00:04:54.078 --> 00:04:56.974
This is the face of heart disease.

00:04:56.974 --> 00:04:59.255
Linda is a middle-aged woman,

00:04:59.255 --> 00:05:01.840
who had a stent placed in one of the arteries

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.940
going to her heart.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.191
When she had recurring symptoms 
she went back to her doctor.

00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:09.829
Her doctor did the gold standard test:

00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:12.116
a cardiac catheterization.

00:05:12.116 --> 00:05:14.533
It showed no blockages.

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:16.605
Linda's symptoms continued.

00:05:16.605 --> 00:05:19.078
She had to stop working.

00:05:19.078 --> 00:05:21.830
And that's when she found us.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.978
When Linda came to us, we did 
another cardiac catheterization

00:05:25.978 --> 00:05:29.395
and this time, we found clues.

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:31.869
But we needed another test

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:34.463
to make the diagnosis.

00:05:34.463 --> 00:05:39.043
So we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound,

00:05:39.043 --> 00:05:41.348
where you use soundwaves to look at the artery

00:05:41.348 --> 00:05:44.079
from the inside out.

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:46.017
And what we found

00:05:46.017 --> 00:05:48.468
was that Linda's disease didn't look like

00:05:48.468 --> 00:05:51.538
the typical male disease.

00:05:51.538 --> 00:05:54.734
The typical male disease looks like this.

00:05:54.734 --> 00:05:58.046
There's a discrete blockage or stenosis.

00:05:58.046 --> 00:06:02.347
Linda's disease, like the disease of so many women,

00:06:02.347 --> 00:06:04.189
looks like this.

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.726
The plaque is laid down more evenly, more diffusely

00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:11.698
along the artery, and it's harder to see.

00:06:11.698 --> 00:06:15.104
So for Linda, and for so many women,

00:06:15.104 --> 00:06:18.796
the gold standard test wasn't gold.

00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:21.783
Now, Linda received the right treatment.

00:06:21.783 --> 00:06:23.961
She went back to her life and, fortunately, today

00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:25.713
she is doing well.

00:06:25.713 --> 00:06:27.319
But Linda was lucky.

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:29.945
She found us, we found her disease.

00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:32.856
But for too many women, that's not the case.

00:06:32.856 --> 00:06:35.171
We have the tools.

00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:38.852
We have the technology to make the diagnosis.

00:06:38.852 --> 00:06:42.249
But it's all too often that these sex diffferences

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:44.553
are overlooked.

00:06:44.553 --> 00:06:46.726
So what about treatment?

00:06:46.726 --> 00:06:49.436
A landmark study that was published two years ago

00:06:49.436 --> 00:06:51.858
asked the very important question:

00:06:51.858 --> 00:06:56.913
What are the most effective treatments 
for heart disease in women?

00:06:56.913 --> 00:07:00.572
The authors looked at papers 
written over a 10-year period,

00:07:00.572 --> 00:07:03.050
and hundreds had to be thrown out.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.823
And what they found out was that 
of those that were tossed out,

00:07:07.823 --> 00:07:11.477
65 percent were excluded

00:07:11.477 --> 00:07:15.841
because even though women 
were included in the studies,

00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:22.197
the analysis didn't differentiate 
between women and men.

00:07:22.197 --> 00:07:25.418
What a lost opportunity.

00:07:25.418 --> 00:07:27.449
The money had been spent

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:29.596
and we didn't learn how women fared.

00:07:29.596 --> 00:07:32.397
And these studies could not contribute one iota

00:07:32.397 --> 00:07:34.814
to the very, very important question,

00:07:34.814 --> 00:07:37.205
what are the most effective treatments

00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:40.100
for heart disease in women?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.592
I want to introduce you to 
Hortense, my godmother,

00:07:45.592 --> 00:07:49.035
Hung Wei, a relative of a colleague,

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:51.226
and somebody you may recognize --

00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:54.873
Dana, Christopher Reeve's wife.

00:07:54.873 --> 00:07:59.233
All three women have something 
very important in common.

00:07:59.233 --> 00:08:02.808
All three were diagnosed with lung cancer,

00:08:02.808 --> 00:08:05.737
the number one cancer killer of women

00:08:05.737 --> 00:08:08.438
in the United States today.

00:08:08.438 --> 00:08:12.314
All three were nonsmokers.

00:08:12.314 --> 00:08:17.480
Sadly, Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:23.620
Today, what we know is that women who are
nonsmokers are three times more likely

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.357
to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men

00:08:26.357 --> 00:08:28.343
who are nonsmokers.

00:08:28.343 --> 00:08:32.033
Now interestingly, when women are 
diagnosed with lung cancer,

00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:35.212
their survival tends to be better than that of men.

00:08:35.212 --> 00:08:37.087
Now, here are some clues.

00:08:37.087 --> 00:08:39.486
Our investigators have found that there are

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:44.158
certain genes in the lung tumor 
cells of both women and men.

00:08:44.158 --> 00:08:46.350
And these genes are activated

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.440
mainly by estrogen.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.258
And when these genes are over-expressed,

00:08:51.258 --> 00:08:53.989
it's associated with improved survival

00:08:53.989 --> 00:08:56.656
only in young women.

00:08:56.656 --> 00:08:58.330
Now this is a very early finding

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.973
and we don't yet know whether it has relevance

00:09:01.973 --> 00:09:04.414
to clinical care.

00:09:04.414 --> 00:09:08.273
But it's findings like this that may provide hope

00:09:08.273 --> 00:09:11.040
and may provide an opportunity to save lives

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.587
of both women and men.

00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:14.968
Now, let me share with you an example

00:09:14.968 --> 00:09:18.946
of when we do consider sex differences,
it can drive the science.

00:09:18.946 --> 00:09:21.274
Several years ago a new lung cancer drug

00:09:21.274 --> 00:09:22.920
was being evaluated,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.292
and when the authors looked 
at whose tumors shrank,

00:09:27.292 --> 00:09:30.725
they found that 82 percent were women.

00:09:30.725 --> 00:09:33.688
This led them to ask the question: Well, why?

00:09:33.688 --> 00:09:35.243
And what they found

00:09:35.243 --> 00:09:38.723
was that the genetic mutations 
that the drug targeted

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:41.450
were far more common in women.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.149
And what this has led to

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:45.331
is a more personalized approach

00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:49.485
to the treatment of lung cancer 
that also includes sex.

00:09:49.485 --> 00:09:51.580
This is what we can accomplish

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.406
when we don't leave women's health to chance.

00:09:55.406 --> 00:09:58.614
We know that when you invest in research,

00:09:58.614 --> 00:10:00.140
you get results.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.648
Take a look at the death rate 
from breast cancer over time.

00:10:04.648 --> 00:10:06.573
And now take a look at the death rates

00:10:06.573 --> 00:10:09.905
from lung cancer in women over time.

00:10:09.905 --> 00:10:13.515
Now let's look at the dollars 
invested in breast cancer --

00:10:13.515 --> 00:10:16.484
these are the dollars invested per death --

00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:20.712
and the dollars invested in lung cancer.

00:10:20.712 --> 00:10:25.633
Now, it's clear that our investment in breast cancer

00:10:25.633 --> 00:10:27.422
has produced results.

00:10:27.422 --> 00:10:29.755
They may not be fast enough,

00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:31.981
but it has produced results.

00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:33.785
We can do the same

00:10:33.785 --> 00:10:38.776
for lung cancer and for every other disease.

00:10:38.776 --> 00:10:42.102
So let's go back to depression.

00:10:42.102 --> 00:10:44.412
Depression is the number one cause

00:10:44.412 --> 00:10:49.004
of disability in women in the world today.

00:10:49.004 --> 00:10:51.139
Our investigators have found

00:10:51.139 --> 00:10:52.955
that there are differences in the brains

00:10:52.955 --> 00:10:54.432
of women and men

00:10:54.432 --> 00:10:57.551
in the areas that are connected with mood.

00:10:57.551 --> 00:10:59.624
And when you put men and women

00:10:59.624 --> 00:11:01.499
in a functional MRI scanner --

00:11:01.499 --> 00:11:06.046
that's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated --

00:11:06.046 --> 00:11:10.089
so you put them in the scanner 
and you expose them to stress.

00:11:10.089 --> 00:11:13.976
You can actually see the difference.

00:11:13.976 --> 00:11:16.505
And it's findings like this

00:11:16.505 --> 00:11:19.486
that we believe hold some of the clues

00:11:19.486 --> 00:11:23.239
for why we see these very significant sex differences

00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:25.493
in depression.

00:11:25.493 --> 00:11:27.051
But even though we know

00:11:27.051 --> 00:11:29.918
that these differences occur,

00:11:29.918 --> 00:11:32.571
66 percent

00:11:32.571 --> 00:11:36.567
of the brain research that begins in animals

00:11:36.567 --> 00:11:38.893
is done in either male animals

00:11:38.893 --> 00:11:43.240
or animals in whom the sex is not identified.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.859
So, I think we have to ask again the question:

00:11:46.859 --> 00:11:51.661
Why leave women's health to chance?

00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:54.489
And this is a question that haunts those of us

00:11:54.489 --> 00:11:56.300
in science and medicine

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:02.659
who believe that we are on the verge 
of being able to dramatically improve

00:12:02.659 --> 00:12:04.335
the health of women.

00:12:04.335 --> 00:12:06.821
We know that every cell has a sex.

00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:09.763
We know that these differences 
are often overlooked.

00:12:09.763 --> 00:12:14.051
And therefore we know that women 
are not getting the full benefit

00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:17.950
of modern science and medicine today.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.601
We have the tools

00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:23.483
but we lack the collective will and momentum.

00:12:23.483 --> 00:12:26.227
Women's health is an equal rights issue

00:12:26.227 --> 00:12:29.781
as important as equal pay.

00:12:29.781 --> 00:12:31.965
And it's an issue of the quality

00:12:31.965 --> 00:12:35.120
and the integrity of science and medicine.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:42.583
(Applause)

00:12:42.583 --> 00:12:47.128
So imagine the momentum we could achieve

00:12:47.128 --> 00:12:49.239
in advancing the health of women

00:12:49.239 --> 00:12:52.098
if we considered whether these 
sex differences were present

00:12:52.098 --> 00:12:55.687
at the very beginning of designing research.

00:12:55.687 --> 00:12:59.566
Or if we analyzed our data by sex.

00:12:59.566 --> 00:13:01.514
So, people often ask me:

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:03.285
What can I do?

00:13:03.285 --> 00:13:05.619
And here's what I suggest:

00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:09.792
First, I suggest that you think about women's health

00:13:09.792 --> 00:13:11.535
in the same way

00:13:11.535 --> 00:13:17.580
that you think and care about other 
causes that are important to you.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.762
And second, and equally as important,

00:13:20.762 --> 00:13:22.974
that as a woman,

00:13:22.974 --> 00:13:25.615
you have to ask your doctor

00:13:25.615 --> 00:13:30.027
and the doctors who are caring 
for those who you love:

00:13:30.027 --> 00:13:34.903
Is this disease or treatment different in women?

00:13:34.903 --> 00:13:38.491
Now, this is a profound question 
because the answer is likely yes,

00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:42.188
but your doctor may not know 
the answer, at least not yet.

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:46.564
But if you ask the question, 
your doctor will very likely

00:13:46.564 --> 00:13:48.846
go looking for the answer.

00:13:48.846 --> 00:13:51.183
And this is so important,

00:13:51.183 --> 00:13:53.345
not only for ourselves,

00:13:53.345 --> 00:13:55.998
but for all of those whom we love.

00:13:55.998 --> 00:14:00.482
Whether it be a mother, a daughter, a sister,

00:14:00.482 --> 00:14:04.179
a friend or a grandmother.

00:14:04.179 --> 00:14:06.322
It was my grandmother's suffering

00:14:06.322 --> 00:14:08.255
that inspired my work

00:14:08.255 --> 00:14:11.240
to improve the health of women.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.590
That's her legacy.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:18.259
Our legacy can be to improve the health of women

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:20.398
for this generation

00:14:20.398 --> 00:14:23.420
and for generations to come.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.569
Thank you.

00:14:25.569 --> 00:14:28.851
(Applause)
