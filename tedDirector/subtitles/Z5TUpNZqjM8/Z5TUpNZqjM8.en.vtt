00:00:18.964 --> 00:00:22.306
Let's talk about manias.

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:24.979
Let's start with Beatlemania.

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.179
(Recording of crowd roaring)

00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:29.306
Hysterical teenagers,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.501
crying, screaming, pandemonium.

00:00:32.525 --> 00:00:35.794
(Recording of crowd roaring)

00:00:35.818 --> 00:00:37.306
Sports mania:

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.306
deafening crowds,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.601
all for one idea --
get the ball in the net.

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:46.306
(Recording) Goal!

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.306
Okay, religious mania:

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.306
there's rapture, there's weeping,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.306
there's visions.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.314
Manias can be good.

00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:57.314
Manias can be alarming.

00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:00.621
Or manias can be deadly.

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:03.229
(Recording of crowd cheering)

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.306
The world has a new mania.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.306
A mania for learning English.

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:12.480
Listen as Chinese students
practice their English,

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:14.306
by screaming it:

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.426
Teacher: ... change my life!

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.861
Students: I want to change my life!

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:21.948
T: I don't want to let my parents down!

00:01:21.972 --> 00:01:25.306
S: I don't want to let my parents down!

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.674
T: I don't ever want
to let my country down!

00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:32.306
S: I don't ever want
to let my country down!

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.869
T: Most importantly...
S: Most importantly...

00:01:35.893 --> 00:01:38.577
T: I don't want to let myself down!

00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:41.306
S: I don't want to let myself down!

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.473
How many people
are trying to learn English worldwide?

00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:46.996
Two billion of them.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.306
Students: A t-shirt. A dress.

00:01:51.157 --> 00:01:52.776
Jay Walker: In Latin America,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.450
in India,

00:01:54.474 --> 00:01:56.101
in Southeast Asia,

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.171
and most of all, in China.

00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:00.306
If you're a Chinese student,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.980
you start learning English
in the third grade, by law.

00:02:05.774 --> 00:02:07.520
That's why this year,

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:12.306
China will become the world's largest
English-speaking country.

00:02:12.613 --> 00:02:14.536
(Laughter)

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.878
Why English?

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.067
In a single word: opportunity.

00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:20.893
Opportunity for a better life, a job,

00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:24.306
to be able to pay for school,
or put better food on the table.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.869
Imagine a student taking
a giant test for three full days.

00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:33.346
Her score on this one test
literally determines her future.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.854
She studies 12 hours a day

00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:38.229
for three years to prepare.

00:02:38.642 --> 00:02:43.197
Twenty-five percent of her grade
is based on English.

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:48.285
It's called the gaokao, and 80 million
high school Chinese students

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.681
have already taken this grueling test.

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:52.974
The intensity to learn English

00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:56.925
is almost unimaginable,
unless you witness it.

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:58.736
Teacher: Perfect!
Students: Perfect!

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.306
T: Perfect!
S: Perfect!

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.750
T: I want to speak perfect English!

00:03:03.774 --> 00:03:06.071
S: I want to speak perfect English!

00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:08.378
T: I want to speak ...
S: I want to speak ...

00:03:08.402 --> 00:03:11.148
T: ... perfect English!
S: ... perfect English!

00:03:11.172 --> 00:03:14.306
T (yelling more loudly):
I want to change my life!

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.282
S (yelling more loudly):
I want to change my life!

00:03:18.306 --> 00:03:21.306
JW: So is English mania good or bad?

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.639
Is English a tsunami,
washing away other languages?

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:26.885
Not likely.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.131
English is the world's second language.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.901
Your native language is your life.

00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:35.861
But with English you can become
part of a wider conversation --

00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:39.591
a global conversation
about global problems,

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:42.306
like climate change or poverty,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.306
or hunger or disease.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.805
The world has other universal languages.

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.306
Mathematics is the language of science.

00:03:51.885 --> 00:03:54.306
Music is the language of emotions.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:59.306
And now English is becoming
the language of problem-solving.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.544
Not because America is pushing it,

00:04:01.568 --> 00:04:04.306
but because the world is pulling it.

00:04:05.195 --> 00:04:07.969
So English mania is a turning point.

00:04:08.453 --> 00:04:11.001
Like the harnessing
of electricity in our cities,

00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:13.306
or the fall of the Berlin Wall,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.692
English represents hope

00:04:15.716 --> 00:04:17.306
for a better future --

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.306
a future where the world
has a common language

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.978
to solve its common problems.

00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:25.528
Thank you very much.

00:04:25.552 --> 00:04:29.052
(Applause)
