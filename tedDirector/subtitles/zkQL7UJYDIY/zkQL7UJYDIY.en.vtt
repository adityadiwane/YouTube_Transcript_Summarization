00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:20.677
So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife.

00:00:20.677 --> 00:00:23.039
It makes me to stand here,

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.693
the fame, the money I got out of it.

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:29.226
So what I did, I'd gone back to my early marriage days.

00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:31.155
What you did in the early marriage days,

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:33.974
you tried to impress your wife. I did the same.

00:00:33.974 --> 00:00:36.809
On that occasion, I found my wife

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.980
carrying something like this.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.220
I saw. "What is that?" I asked.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.489
My wife replied, "None of your business."

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.580
Then, being her husband, I ran behind her

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.116
and saw she had a nasty rag cloth.

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:51.084
I don't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.886
Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.187
to manage her period days.

00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:57.972
Then I immediately asked her, why are you [using] that unhygienic method?

00:00:57.972 --> 00:01:01.510
She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads],

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.585
but myself and my sisters, if they start using that,

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:07.169
we have to cut our family milk budget.

00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:08.488
Then I was shocked. What is the connection between

00:01:08.488 --> 00:01:09.953
using a sanitary pad and a milk budget?

00:01:09.953 --> 00:01:12.443
And it's called affordability.

00:01:12.443 --> 00:01:16.765
I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads.

00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:19.926
I went to a local shop, I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet.

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:21.519
That fellow looks left and right,

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:23.960
and spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.744
gives it to me like a banned item, something like that.

00:01:27.744 --> 00:01:31.543
I don't know why. I did not ask for a condom.

00:01:31.543 --> 00:01:35.664
Then I took that pad. I want to see that. What is inside it?

00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:39.619
The very first time, at the age of 29,

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.694
that day I am touching the sanitary pad, first ever.

00:01:41.694 --> 00:01:46.754
I must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad?

00:01:46.754 --> 00:01:51.394
They are not going to touch that, because it's not your matter.

00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:54.622
Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton --

00:01:54.622 --> 00:01:57.963
oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material --

00:01:57.963 --> 00:02:00.517
inside they are selling for pounds, dollars.

00:02:00.517 --> 00:02:05.331
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?

00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:08.340
That's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.736
where can I check it?

00:02:09.736 --> 00:02:12.962
It's not like I can just check it in the lab.

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:15.912
I need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India?

00:02:15.912 --> 00:02:19.492
Even in Bangalore you won't get [one], in India.

00:02:19.492 --> 00:02:24.896
So only problem: the only available victim is my wife.

00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:29.496
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti.

00:02:29.496 --> 00:02:30.800
"Close your eyes. Whatever I give,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.412
it will be not a diamond pendant

00:02:32.412 --> 00:02:33.961
not a diamond ring, even a chocolate,

00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:37.465
I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it.

00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:39.416
Close your eyes."

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:42.490
Because I tried to make it intimate.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.701
Because it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage.

00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:48.220
(Laughter)

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.799
So one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research.

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.915
Then other victims, they got into my sisters.

00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:58.312
But even sisters, wives, they're not ready to support in the research.

00:02:58.312 --> 00:03:01.354
That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India.

00:03:01.354 --> 00:03:04.913
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them.

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:06.609
Why I am not getting [any]?

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:14.697
You know, without them even calling, they'll get a lot of women volunteers.

00:03:14.697 --> 00:03:17.780
Then I used, tried to use the medical college girls.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.389
They also refused. Finally, I decide,

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.240
use sanitary pad myself.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.371
Now I am having a title like

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:29.548
the first man to set foot on the moon.

00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:32.716
Armstrong. Then Tenzing [and] Hillary, in Everest,

00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:34.605
like that Muruganantham is the first man

00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:38.517
wore a sanitary pad across the globe.

00:03:38.517 --> 00:03:41.781
I wore a sanitary pad. I filled animal blood in a football bottle,

00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:44.467
I tied it up here, there is a tube going into my panties,

00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:47.091
while I'm walking, while I'm cycling, I made a press,

00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:49.407
doses of blood will go there.

00:03:49.407 --> 00:03:53.435
That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me

00:03:53.435 --> 00:03:56.413
to give full respect. That five days I'll never forget --

00:03:56.413 --> 00:03:59.069
the messy days, the lousy days, that wetness.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.723
My God, it's unbelievable.

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:09.484
But here the problem is, one company is making napkin

00:04:09.484 --> 00:04:11.900
out of cotton. It is working well.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.908
But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton. It's not working.

00:04:14.908 --> 00:04:18.492
That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research.

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:20.193
You need first funds.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:23.511
Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research,

00:04:23.511 --> 00:04:27.227
I come through all sorts of problems, including

00:04:27.227 --> 00:04:29.630
a divorce notice from my wife.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.725
Why is this? I used medical college girls.

00:04:32.725 --> 00:04:35.579
She suspects I am using as a trump card

00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:38.035
to run behind medical college girls.

00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:41.278
Finally, I came to know it is a special cellulose

00:04:41.278 --> 00:04:43.686
derived from a pinewood, but even after that,

00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:45.688
you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this

00:04:45.688 --> 00:04:49.050
to process that material. Again, a stop-up.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.810
Then I spend another four years to create my own

00:04:52.812 --> 00:04:55.475
machine tools, a simple machine tool like this.

00:04:55.475 --> 00:04:58.719
In this machine, any rural woman can apply the same

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.563
raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant,

00:05:01.563 --> 00:05:05.255
anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall.

00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:08.472
That is my invention.

00:05:08.472 --> 00:05:11.195
So after that, what I did,

00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:14.658
usually if anyone got a patent or an invention,

00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:18.201
immediately you want to make, convert into this.

00:05:18.201 --> 00:05:21.251
I never did this. I dropped it just like this,

00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:24.835
because you do this, if anyone runs after money,

00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:28.552
their life will not [have] any beauty. It is boredom.

00:05:28.552 --> 00:05:30.563
A lot of people making a lot of money, billion,

00:05:30.563 --> 00:05:32.717
billions of dollars accumulating.

00:05:32.717 --> 00:05:34.963
Why are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy?

00:05:34.963 --> 00:05:38.480
Why the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.789
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.337
That's why I am giving this machine

00:05:45.337 --> 00:05:49.275
only in rural India, for rural women, because in India,

00:05:49.275 --> 00:05:51.751
[you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:55.092
are using sanitary pads. The rest, they're using a rag cloth,

00:05:55.092 --> 00:05:58.952
a leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads.

00:05:58.952 --> 00:06:01.339
It is the same in the 21st century. That's why I am going

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:04.880
to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.261
So far, 630 installations happened in 23 states

00:06:08.261 --> 00:06:10.897
in six other countries.

00:06:10.897 --> 00:06:15.379
Now I'm on my seventh year sustaining against

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:20.397
multinational, transnational giants -- makes all MBA students a question mark.

00:06:20.397 --> 00:06:23.682
A school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining?

00:06:23.682 --> 00:06:29.782
That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs.

00:06:29.782 --> 00:06:34.945
(Applause)

00:06:34.945 --> 00:06:37.790
Play video one.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.962
(Video) Arunachalam Muruganantham: The thing I saw in my wife's hand, "Why are you using that nasty cloth?"

00:06:42.962 --> 00:06:47.275
She replied immediately, "I know about napkins, but if I start

00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:51.174
using napkins, then we have to cut our family milk budget."

00:06:51.174 --> 00:06:55.595
Why not make myself a low-cost napkin?

00:06:55.595 --> 00:06:58.376
So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.458
only for Women Self Help Groups.

00:07:05.236 --> 00:07:08.442
That is my idea.

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:14.404
AM: And previously, you need a multimillion investment

00:07:14.404 --> 00:07:17.904
for machine and all. Now, any rural woman can.

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:19.773
They are performing puja.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:36.787
(Video): (Singing)

00:07:36.787 --> 00:07:41.373
You just think, competing giants,

00:07:41.373 --> 00:07:43.264
even from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult.

00:07:43.264 --> 00:07:46.148
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals.

00:07:46.148 --> 00:07:47.718
I'm sustaining on seventh year.

00:07:47.718 --> 00:07:49.979
Already 600 installations. What is my mission?

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:51.840
I'm going to make India

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.844
[into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime.

00:07:55.844 --> 00:07:57.829
In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million

00:07:57.829 --> 00:07:59.887
rural employment that I'm going to create.

00:07:59.887 --> 00:08:03.443
That's why I'm not running after this bloody money.

00:08:03.443 --> 00:08:04.943
I'm doing something serious.

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:09.292
If you chase a girl, the girl won't like you.

00:08:09.292 --> 00:08:11.690
Do your job simply, the girl will chase you.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.041
Like that, I never chased Mahalakshmi.

00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:18.911
Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.

00:08:18.911 --> 00:08:23.367
Not in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man.

00:08:23.367 --> 00:08:26.939
That's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:28.971
of not using sanitary pad.

00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:31.271
I am becoming a solution provider. I'm very happy.

00:08:31.271 --> 00:08:34.114
I don't want to make this as a corporate entity.

00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:38.117
I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:40.970
across the globe. That's why I put all the details

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.334
on public domain like an open software.

00:08:44.334 --> 00:08:48.896
Now 110 countries are accessing it. Okay?

00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:52.896
So I classify the people into three:

00:08:52.896 --> 00:08:59.818
uneducated, little educated, surplus educated.

00:08:59.818 --> 00:09:03.709
Little educated, done this. Surplus educated,

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:05.113
what are you going to do for the society?

00:09:05.113 --> 00:09:08.880
Thank you very much. Bye!

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:20.197
(Applause)
