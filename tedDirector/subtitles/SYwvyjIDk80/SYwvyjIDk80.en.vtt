00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
But before I show you what I've got inside,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
I'm going to make a very public confession,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
and that is,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I'm outfit-obsessed.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
I love finding, wearing,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and more recently,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
photographing and blogging

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
a different, colorful, crazy outfit

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
for every single occasion.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
But I don't buy anything new.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I get all my clothes secondhand

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
from flea markets and thrift stores.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Aww, thank you.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Secondhand shopping

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
allows me to reduce the impact

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
my wardrobe has on the environment

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and on my wallet.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
I get to meet all kinds of great people;

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
my dollars usually go to a good cause;

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
I look pretty unique;

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
I mean, what am I going to find today?

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Is it going to be my size?

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Will I like the color?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Will it be under $20?

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
If all the answers are yes,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
I feel as though I've won.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
I want to get back to my suitcase

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and tell you what I packed

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
for this exciting week here at TED.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.260
I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
I brought seven pairs of underpants

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and that's it.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Exactly one week's worth of undies

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
is all I put in my suitcase.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
I was betting that I'd be able to find

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
everything else I could possible want to wear

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
once I got here to Palm Springs.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And since you don't know me

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
as the woman walking around TED in her underwear --

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
(Laughter)

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that means I found a few things.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Does that sound good?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
(Applause)

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
So as I do this,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
that, believe it or not, I have picked up

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
in these adventures wearing nothing new.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
So let's start with Sunday.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
I call this "Shiny Tiger."

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.260
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
This whole outfit, including the jacket,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
cost me $55,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
and it was the most expensive thing

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
that I wore the entire week.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Monday: Color is powerful.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
It is almost physiologically impossible

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
(Laughter)

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
If you are happy,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
you are going to attract other happy people to you.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Tuesday:

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Fitting in is way overrated.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
I've spent a whole lot of my life

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
trying to be myself

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and at the same time fit in.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Just be who you are.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
they will not only get it,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
they will appreciate it.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Wednesday:

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Embrace your inner child.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Sometimes people tell me

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
that I look like I'm playing dress-up,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
or that I remind them of their seven-year-old.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
I like to smile

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
and say, "Thank you."

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Thursday:

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Confidence is key.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
If you think you look good in something,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
you almost certainly do.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
And if you don't think you look good in something,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
you're also probably right.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.260
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
But it wasn't until I turned 30

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
that I really got what this meant.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
If you believe you're a beautiful person

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
inside and out,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
there is no look that you can't pull off.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
Thank you.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
(Applause)

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you:

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Gold sequins go with everything.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And finally, Saturday:

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
Developing your own unique personal style

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
is a really great way to tell the world something about you

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
without having to say a word.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
It's been proven to me time and time again

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
as people have walked up to me this week

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
simply because of what I'm wearing,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
and we've had great conversations.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
So obviously this is not all going to fit

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
back in my tiny suitcase.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
So before I go home to Brooklyn,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
I'm going to donate everything back.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
is that it's okay to let go.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
because around the corner,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
there is always going to be

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
another crazy, colorful,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
shiny outfit

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
just waiting for me,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
if I put a little love in my heart and look.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Thank you very much.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
(Applause)

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Thank you.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.260
(Applause)
