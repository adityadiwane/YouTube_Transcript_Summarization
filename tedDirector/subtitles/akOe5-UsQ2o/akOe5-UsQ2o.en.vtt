00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.520
I'd like to try something new.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.736
Those of you who are able,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.960
please stand up.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.600
OK, so I'm going to name some names.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.456
When you hear a name
that you don't recognize,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.335
you can't tell me anything about them,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.136
I'd like you to take a seat

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.480
and stay seated.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.856
The last person standing,
we're going to see what they know. OK?

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.456
(Laughter)

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.680
All right.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.360
Eric Garner.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.760
Mike Brown.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.520
Tamir Rice.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.960
Freddie Gray.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.136
So those of you who are still standing,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.256
I'd like you to turn around
and take a look.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.280
I'd say half to most of the people
are still standing.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.120
So let's continue.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.000
Michelle Cusseaux.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.640
Tanisha Anderson.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.640
Aura Rosser.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.800
Meagan Hockaday.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.216
So if we look around again,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.256
there are about four people
still standing,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.976
and actually I'm not going
to put you on the spot.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.576
I just say that to encourage transparency,
so you can be seated.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.280
(Laughter)

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.776
So those of you who recognized
the first group of names know

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.696
that these were African-Americans
who have been killed by the police

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.920
over the last two and a half years.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.416
What you may not know

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.856
is that the other list
is also African-Americans

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.680
who have been killed
within the last two years.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.656
Only one thing distinguishes
the names that you know

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.360
from the names that you don't know:

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.520
gender.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.536
So let me first let you know
that there's nothing at all distinct

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.336
about this audience

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.176
that explains the pattern of recognition
that we've just seen.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.696
I've done this exercise
dozens of times around the country.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.296
I've done it to women's
rights organizations.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.456
I've done it with civil rights groups.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.456
I've done it with professors.
I've done it with students.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.736
I've done it with psychologists.
I've done it with sociologists.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.256
I've done it even with
progressive members of Congress.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.576
And everywhere, the awareness
of the level of police violence

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.496
that black women experience

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.520
is exceedingly low.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.176
Now, it is surprising, isn't it,
that this would be the case.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.216
I mean, there are two issues
involved here.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.336
There's police violence
against African-Americans,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.416
and there's violence against women,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.400
two issues that have been
talked about a lot lately.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.096
But when we think about
who is implicated by these problems,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.616
when we think about
who is victimized by these problems,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.720
the names of these black women
never come to mind.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.416
Now, communications experts tell us

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.896
that when facts do not fit
with the available frames,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.656
people have a difficult time
incorporating new facts

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.960
into their way of thinking
about a problem.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.336
These women's names
have slipped through our consciousness

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.776
because there are no frames
for us to see them,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.096
no frames for us to remember them,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.080
no frames for us to hold them.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.840
As a consequence,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.440
reporters don't lead with them,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.376
policymakers don't think about them,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.800
and politicians aren't encouraged
or demanded that they speak to them.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.416
Now, you might ask,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.016
why does a frame matter?

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.856
I mean, after all,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.176
an issue that affects black people
and an issue that affects women,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.256
wouldn't that necessarily include
black people who are women

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.560
and women who are black people?

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.776
Well, the simple answer is that this is
a trickle-down approach to social justice,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800
and many times it just doesn't work.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.776
Without frames that allow us to see

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.536
how social problems impact
all the members of a targeted group,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.776
many will fall through the cracks
of our movements,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.240
left to suffer in virtual isolation.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.280
But it doesn't have to be this way.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.216
Many years ago, I began to use
the term "intersectionality"

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.336
to deal with the fact
that many of our social justice problems

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.256
like racism and sexism

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.480
are often overlapping,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.040
creating multiple levels
of social injustice.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.416
Now, the experience
that gave rise to intersectionality

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.400
was my chance encounter
with a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.056
Emma DeGraffenreid
was an African-American woman,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.776
a working wife and a mother.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.216
I actually read about Emma's story
from the pages of a legal opinion

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.376
written by a judge
who had dismissed Emma's claim

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.496
of race and gender discrimination

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.720
against a local car manufacturing plant.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.176
Emma, like so many African-American women,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.976
sought better employment
for her family and for others.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.416
She wanted to create a better life
for her children and for her family.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.656
But she applied for a job,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.376
and she was not hired,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.040
and she believed that she was not hired
because she was a black woman.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.416
Now, the judge in question
dismissed Emma's suit,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.016
and the argument
for dismissing the suit was

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.376
that the employer
did hire African-Americans

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.760
and the employer hired women.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.416
The real problem, though, that the judge
was not willing to acknowledge

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.616
was what Emma was actually trying to say,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.536
that the African-Americans
that were hired,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.320
usually for industrial jobs,
maintenance jobs, were all men.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.216
And the women that were hired,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.856
usually for secretarial
or front-office work,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.080
were all white.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.456
Only if the court was able to see
how these policies came together

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.136
would he be able to see
the double discrimination

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.280
that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.456
But the court refused to allow Emma
to put two causes of action together

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.856
to tell her story

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.816
because he believed that,
by allowing her to do that,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.776
she would be able
to have preferential treatment.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.016
She would have an advantage
by having two swings at the bat,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.680
when African-American men and white women
only had one swing at the bat.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.456
But of course, neither
African-American men or white women

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.056
needed to combine a race
and gender discrimination claim

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.440
to tell the story of the discrimination
they were experiencing.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.496
Why wasn't the real unfairness

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.656
law's refusal to protect
African-American women

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.776
simply because their experiences
weren't exactly the same

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.560
as white women and African-American men?

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.536
Rather than broadening the frame
to include African-American women,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.840
the court simply tossed their case
completely out of court.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.056
Now, as a student
of antidiscrimination law,

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.536
as a feminist,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.936
as an antiracist,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.176
I was struck by this case.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.856
It felt to me like injustice squared.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.976
So first of all,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.840
black women weren't allowed
to work at the plant.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.616
Second of all, the court
doubled down on this exclusion

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.000
by making it legally inconsequential.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.880
And to boot, there was
no name for this problem.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.096
And we all know that,
where there's no name for a problem,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.376
you can't see a problem,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.600
and when you can't see a problem,
you pretty much can't solve it.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:52.775
Many years later, I had come to recognize

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:58.400
that the problem that Emma was facing
was a framing problem.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.096
The frame that the court was using

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.096
to see gender discrimination
or to see race discrimination

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.040
was partial, and it was distorting.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.776
For me, the challenge that I faced was

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.616
trying to figure out whether
there was an alternative narrative,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.336
a prism that would allow us
to see Emma's dilemma,

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:28.296
a prism that would allow us
to rescue her from the cracks in the law,

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.600
that would allow judges to see her story.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.896
So it occurred to me,

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.936
maybe a simple analogy to an intersection

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.240
might allow judges
to better see Emma's dilemma.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.696
So if we think about this intersection,
the roads to the intersection would be

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:55.640
the way that the workforce
was structured by race and by gender.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.856
And then the traffic in those roads
would be the hiring policies

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.416
and the other practices
that ran through those roads.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.376
Now, because Emma
was both black and female,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.080
she was positioned precisely
where those roads overlapped,

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.976
experiencing the simultaneous impact

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.960
of the company's gender and race traffic.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:31.176
The law -- the law is
like that ambulance that shows up

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.616
and is ready to treat Emma
only if it can be shown

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.256
that she was harmed
on the race road or on the gender road

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.120
but not where those roads intersected.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.176
So what do you call
being impacted by multiple forces

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.760
and then abandoned to fend for yourself?

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.360
Intersectionality seemed to do it for me.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.776
I would go on to learn
that African-American women,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.736
like other women of color,

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.816
like other socially marginalized people
all over the world,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.816
were facing all kinds
of dilemmas and challenges

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.936
as a consequence of intersectionality,

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.536
intersections of race and gender,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.776
of heterosexism, transphobia,
xenophobia, ableism,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.376
all of these social dynamics come together

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.640
and create challenges
that are sometimes quite unique.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.856
But in the same way

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.440
that intersectionality

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.280
raised our awareness to the way
that black women live their lives,

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.416
it also exposes the tragic circumstances

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.600
under which African-American women die.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.960
Police violence against black women

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.320
is very real.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.576
The level of violence
that black women face

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.760
is such that it's not surprising

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.960
that some of them do not survive
their encounters with police.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.656
Black girls as young as seven,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.400
great grandmothers as old as 95

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.280
have been killed by the police.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.000
They've been killed in their living rooms,

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.000
in their bedrooms.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.720
They've been killed in their cars.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.736
They've been killed on the street.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.616
They've been killed
in front of their parents

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.440
and they've been killed
in front of their children.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.800
They have been shot to death.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.960
They have been stomped to death.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.840
They have been suffocated to death.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.496
They have been manhandled to death.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.000
They have been tasered to death.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.160
They've been killed
when they've called for help.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.656
They've been killed when they were alone,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.800
and they've been killed
when they were with others.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.640
They've been killed shopping while black,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.000
driving while black,

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.520
having a mental disability while black,

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.920
having a domestic disturbance while black.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.080
They've even been killed
being homeless while black.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.816
They've been killed
talking on the cell phone,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.216
laughing with friends,

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.296
sitting in a car reported as stolen

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.936
and making a U-turn
in front of the White House

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.800
with an infant strapped
in the backseat of the car.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.840
Why don't we know these stories?

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.640
Why is it that their lost lives

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.176
don't generate the same amount
of media attention and communal outcry

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.360
as the lost lives
of their fallen brothers?

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.760
It's time for a change.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.480
So what can we do?

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.176
In 2014, the African-American
Policy Forum began to demand

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.440
that we "say her name"

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.200
at rallies, at protests,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.616
at conferences, at meetings,

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.256
anywhere and everywhere

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.280
that state violence against black bodies
is being discussed.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.456
But saying her name is not enough.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.056
We have to be willing to do more.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.296
We have to be willing to bear witness,

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.936
to bear witness
to the often painful realities

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.696
that we would just rather not confront,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:52.176
the everyday violence and humiliation
that many black women have had to face,

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.576
black women across color,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.016
age, gender expression,

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.320
sexuality and ability.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.216
So we have the opportunity right now --

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.256
bearing in mind that some of the images
that I'm about to share with you

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.000
may be triggering for some --

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.600
to collectively bear witness
to some of this violence.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.400
We're going to hear the voice
of the phenomenal Abby Dobson.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.160
And as we sit with these women,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.960
some who have experienced violence
and some who have not survived them,

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.896
we have an opportunity

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.656
to reverse what happened
at the beginning of this talk,

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.376
when we could not stand for these women

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.760
because we did not know their names.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.040
So at the end of this clip,
there's going to be a roll call.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.160
Several black women's names will come up.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.736
I'd like those of you who are able
to join us in saying these names

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.136
as loud as you can,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.896
randomly, disorderly.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.720
Let's create a cacophony of sound

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.720
to represent our intention

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.520
to hold these women up,

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.936
to sit with them,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.680
to bear witness to them,

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.240
to bring them into the light.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:34.920
(Singing) Abby Dobson: Say,

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:41.360
say her name.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:48.760
Say,

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.256
say her name.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.480
(Audience) Shelly!

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.816
(Audience) Kayla!

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:04.280
AD: Oh,

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.856
say her name.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.416
(Audience shouting names)

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:21.400
Say, say,

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:27.520
say her name.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:34.656
Say her name.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.536
For all the names

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.880
I'll never know,

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.776
say her name.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.576
KC: Aiyanna Stanley Jones,
Janisha Fonville,

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.936
Kathryn Johnston, Kayla Moore,

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.816
Michelle Cusseaux, Rekia Boyd,

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.280
Shelly Frey, Tarika, Yvette Smith.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:07.520
AD: Say her name.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.896
KC: So I said at the beginning,

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.680
if we can't see a problem,

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.320
we can't fix a problem.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.976
Together, we've come together
to bear witness

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.080
to these women's lost lives.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.616
But the time now is to move

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.136
from mourning and grief

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.920
to action and transformation.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.360
This is something that we can do.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.840
It's up to us.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.736
Thank you for joining us.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.976
Thank you.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.320
(Applause)
