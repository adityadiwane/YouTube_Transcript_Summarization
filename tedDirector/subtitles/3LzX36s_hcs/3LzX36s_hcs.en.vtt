00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Under a tree she saw a woman

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
meditating furiously.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260
To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Just then, with a loud bang,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
the heavens opened. (Claps)

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And the god Indra jumped into the clearing.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Ah-hah.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
The woman paid him no heed.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and proceeded to rape her.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Then Indra disappeared. (Clap! Clap!)

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
He realized at once what had happened.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
So, he petitioned the higher gods

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
so that he may have justice.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
So, the god Vishnu arrived.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
"Are there any witnesses?"

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
"Just a one-eyed monkey," said the Brahmin.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Now, the one-eyed monkey

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.260
really wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
so she retold events exactly as they had happened.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Vishnu gave his judgment.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
"The god Indra has sinned,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.260
in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.260
May he be called to wash away his sins."

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
So, Indra arrived,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and performed the sacrifice of the horse.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
And so it transpired

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
that a horse was killed,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.260
a god was made sin-free,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
a Brahmin's ego was appeased,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
a woman ... was ruined,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and a one-eyed monkey was left ...

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.260
very confused at what we humans call justice.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.260
In India there is a rape every three minutes.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.260
In India, only 25 percent of rapes

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
come to a police station,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.260
and of these 25 percent that come to a police station,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.260
convictions are only in four percent of the cases.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
That's a lot of women who don't get justice.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And it's not only about women.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Look around you, look at your own countries.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.260
There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.260
If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
our tribals, the Naxalites.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.260
If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
There is a trend here.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
always get to tell their truth as The Truth.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
So, have we all become

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
one-eyed -- two-eyed instead of one-eyed -- monkeys?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Have we stopped seeing injustice?

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Good morning.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.260
(Applause)

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.260
You know, I have told this story

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
close to 550 times,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
in audiences in 40 countries,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.260
to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and every time it hits something.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Now, if I were to go into the same crowd

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
and say, "I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,"

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
they would say, "Thank you very much, we have other things to do."

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And that is the astonishing power of art.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Art can go through where other things can't.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.260
You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
breaks through everything that you have as your mask,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
that says, "I am this, I am that, I am that."

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
No. It breaks through those.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
And it reaches somewhere where other things don't.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.260
we need a language that reaches through.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Hitler knew it; he used Wagner

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.260
to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.260
this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
they also know the power of the arts.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
For me it came very early.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
came upon a phenomenon that worried her.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
It was a phenomenon where young brides

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
were committing suicide in rural Gujarat,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.260
because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.260
And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
He came to talk to her and said, "What is this about?"

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.260
She told him and he set out the first inquiry

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
into what today we call Dowry Dance.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Imagine a dance piece

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
for the first inquiry into something

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.260
that even today kills thousands of women.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Many years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.260
in "The Mahabharata" playing this feisty feminine feminist

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
called Draupadi, I had similar experiences.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Big fat black mamas in the Bronx

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
used to come and say, "Hey girl, that's it!"

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.260
"Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça? Ça!"

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And then aboriginal women in Africa

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.260
would come and say, "This is it!"

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
And I thought, "This is what we need,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
as a language."

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.260
We had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Well, millions of people around the world die

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
of waterborne disease every year.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And that's because there is no clean water to drink,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
or in countries like India,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
So, what do they do?

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
They drink the water they know is dirty,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and they die.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And governments have not been able to provide clean water.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
They try and build it. They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.260
And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
So what do you do? Do you let them die?

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
Well, somebody had a great idea.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.260
but would help health in every field.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
Most houses in Asia and India

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
have a cotton garment.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.260
And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.260
can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.260
So, why aren't governments blaring this on television?

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Why isn't it on every poster across the third world?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Because there is no profit in it.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
Because nobody can get a kickback.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
But it still needs to get to people.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
And here is one of the ways we get it to people.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
[Video] Woman: Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Man: You know how expensive those are.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.260
I have a solution that requires neither machine,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.260
nor wood, nor cooking gas.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
Woman: What solution?

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Man: Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
Boy: Grand-dad, tell me the solution please.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Man: I will tell all of you. Just wait.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Woman: Here father. (Man: Is it clean?) Woman: Yes, of course.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Man: Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
Woman: All right, father.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Man: And you, you count that she does it right. (Boy: All right, grand-dad.)

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
Man: One, two, three, four folds we make.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
All the germs from the water we take.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
Chorus: One, two, three, four folds we make.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
All the germs from the water we take.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
Our drinking water safe we make.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
Our drinking water safe we make.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
Woman: Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
Man: So this is the cotton sari.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
And through this we will have clean water.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.260
(Applause)

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
I think it's safe to say that all of us here

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.260
are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
or whether it's domestic violence,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.260
whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
because she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
So, why are we not doing something

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
What are we doing to try and make children

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
and young people realize

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
that violence is something that we indulge in,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
that we can stop,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
and that there are other ways of actually

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.260
taking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
into different things that do not harm other people.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
Well, here is one such way.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.260
(Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Your parents were peaceful people.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Your grandparents were peaceful people.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.260
So much peace in one place?

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
How could it be otherwise?

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.260
(Music)

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.260
But, what if ...

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Yes. What if ...

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
One little gene in you

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
has been trying to get through?

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
From your beginnings in Africa,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
through each generation, may be passed on to you,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.260
in your creation. It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:35.260
And if it's in you, then it's in me too. Oh, dear.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.260
It's what made you smack your baby brother,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.260
when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:11:00.260
and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh, dear.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
And as for outsiders, white, black or brown,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
tar and feather them, and whip them out of town.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.260
Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Adrenaline, kill. It'll give you the will.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:47.260
Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.260
Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Goodbye, Martin Luther King.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.260
Hello, gangs from this neighborhood

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.260
killing gangs from that neighborhood.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
Hello governments of rich countries

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.260
selling arms to governments of poor countries

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.260
who can't even afford to give them food.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:19.260
Hello civilization. Hello, 21st century.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:24.260
Look what we've ...

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.260
look what they've done.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:35.260
(Applause)

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Mainstream art, cinema,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.260
has been used across the world to talk about social issues.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.260
which suddenly spawned thousands of young people

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
wanting to volunteer for social change.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
In Venezuela, one of the most popular

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
soap operas has a heroine called Crystal.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.260
And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:05.260
75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And of course, "The Vagina Monologues" we know about.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
And there are stand-up comics

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
So, why is it,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
that if we think that we all agree

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
that we need a better world,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
we need a more just world,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
why is it that we are not using the one language

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
that has consistently showed us

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.260
that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
What I need to say to the planners of the world,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
the governments, the strategists

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:39.260
is, "You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
It needs to be the yeast."

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
Because, any future planning,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
if 2048 is when we want to get there,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
unless the arts are put with the scientists,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
with the economists,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:57.260
with all those who prepare for the future, badly,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
we're not going to get there.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:04.260
And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
So, what is it that we require? What is it that we need?

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
We need to break down our vision

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
of what planners are,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
of what the correct way of a path is.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
And to say all these years of trying

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
to make a better world, and we have failed.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
There are more people being raped. There are more wars.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
There are more people dying of simple things.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
So, something has got to give. And that is what I want.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
Can I have my last audio track please?

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.260
Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
(Whistling)

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
Her father the king said, "Don't whistle."

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
Her mother the queen said, "Hai, don't whistle."

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
But the princess continued whistling.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.260
(Whistling)

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
The years went by and the princess grew up

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
into a beautiful young woman,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
who whistled even more beautifully.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:04.260
(Whistling)

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.260
Her father the king said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.260
Her mother the queen said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
But the king had an idea.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
He announced a Swayamvara.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.260
He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
"Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
and her hand in marriage!"

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:31.260
Soon the palace filled with princes whistling.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
(Whistling)

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
Some whistled badly.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
Some whistled well.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.260
But nobody could defeat the princess.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
"Now what shall we do?" said the king.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
"Now what shall we do?" said the queen.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
But the princess said, "Father, Mother, don't worry.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
and I am going to ask them

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
if they defeated correctly.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.260
So she went up to each and said, "Do you accept that I have defeated you?"

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
And they said, "Me? Defeated by a woman?

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.260
No way, that's impossible! No no no no no! That's not possible."

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
Till finally one prince said,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.260
"Princess, I accept, you have defeated me."

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
"Uh-huh ..." she said.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.260
"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:29.260
(Whistling)

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
Thank you.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:46.260
(Applause)
