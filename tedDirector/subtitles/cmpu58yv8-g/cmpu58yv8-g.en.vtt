00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.536
When Dorothy was a little girl,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.360
she was fascinated by her goldfish.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.536
Her father explained to her that fish swim
by quickly wagging their tails

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.440
to propel themselves through the water.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.176
Without hesitation,
little Dorothy responded,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.456
"Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwards
by wagging their heads."

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.096
(Laughter)

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.936
In her mind, it was a fact
as true as any other.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.296
Fish swim backwards
by wagging their heads.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.520
She believed it.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.296
Our lives are full
of fish swimming backwards.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.816
We make assumptions
and faulty leaps of logic.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.095
We harbor bias.

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:46.376
We know that we are right,
and they are wrong.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.016
We fear the worst.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.200
We strive for unattainable perfection.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.000
We tell ourselves
what we can and cannot do.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.976
In our minds, fish swim by in reverse
frantically wagging their heads

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.429
and we don't even notice them.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.336
I'm going to tell you
five facts about myself.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.680
One fact is not true.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.560
One: I graduated from Harvard at 19
with an honors degree in mathematics.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.640
Two: I currently run
a construction company in Orlando.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.040
Three: I starred on a television sitcom.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.880
Four: I lost my sight
to a rare genetic eye disease.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.400
Five: I served as a law clerk
to two US Supreme Court justices.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.560
Which fact is not true?

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.240
Actually, they're all true.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.520
Yeah. They're all true.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.960
(Applause)

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.336
At this point, most people really
only care about the television show.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.040
(Laughter)

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.240
I know this from experience.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.656
OK, so the show was NBC's
"Saved by the Bell: The New Class."

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.280
And I played Weasel Wyzell,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.296
who was the sort of dorky,
nerdy character on the show,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.096
which made it a very
major acting challenge

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.616
for me as a 13-year-old boy.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.160
(Laughter)

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.240
Now, did you struggle
with number four, my blindness?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.320
Why is that?

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.256
We make assumptions
about so-called disabilities.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.456
As a blind man, I confront
others' incorrect assumptions

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.240
about my abilities every day.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.176
My point today is not
about my blindness, however.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.400
It's about my vision.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.280
Going blind taught me
to live my life eyes wide open.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.576
It taught me to spot
those backwards-swimming fish

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.096
that our minds create.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.280
Going blind cast them into focus.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.840
What does it feel like to see?

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.360
It's immediate and passive.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.936
You open your eyes and there's the world.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.056
Seeing is believing. Sight is truth.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.280
Right?

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.800
Well, that's what I thought.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.440
Then, from age 12 to 25,
my retinas progressively deteriorated.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.296
My sight became an increasingly bizarre

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.600
carnival funhouse hall
of mirrors and illusions.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.976
The salesperson I was relieved
to spot in a store

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.200
was really a mannequin.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.376
Reaching down to wash my hands,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.616
I suddenly saw it was
a urinal I was touching, not a sink,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.355
when my fingers felt its true shape.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.296
A friend described
the photograph in my hand,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.440
and only then I could see
the image depicted.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.040
Objects appeared, morphed
and disappeared in my reality.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.520
It was difficult and exhausting to see.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.856
I pieced together fragmented,
transitory images,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.856
consciously analyzed the clues,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.960
searched for some logic
in my crumbling kaleidoscope,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.126
until I saw nothing at all.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.256
I learned that what we see

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.640
is not universal truth.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.400
It is not objective reality.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.696
What we see is a unique,
personal, virtual reality

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.840
that is masterfully
constructed by our brain.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.894
Let me explain with a bit
of amateur neuroscience.

00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:13.158
Your visual cortex takes up
about 30 percent of your brain.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.016
That's compared to approximately
eight percent for touch

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.840
and two to three percent for hearing.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.336
Every second, your eyes
can send your visual cortex

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.520
as many as two billion
pieces of information.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.800
The rest of your body can send your brain
only an additional billion.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.896
So sight is one third
of your brain by volume

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.240
and can claim about two thirds
of your brain's processing resources.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.256
It's no surprise then

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.376
that the illusion
of sight is so compelling.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.800
But make no mistake about it:
sight is an illusion.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.736
Here's where it gets interesting.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.856
To create the experience of sight,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.416
your brain references your conceptual
understanding of the world,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.496
other knowledge, your memories,
opinions, emotions, mental attention.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.080
All of these things and far more
are linked in your brain to your sight.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.456
These linkages work both ways,
and usually occur subconsciously.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.336
So for example,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.496
what you see impacts how you feel,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.120
and the way you feel
can literally change what you see.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.760
Numerous studies demonstrate this.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.456
If you are asked to estimate

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.656
the walking speed of a man
in a video, for example,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.800
your answer will be different if you're
told to think about cheetahs or turtles.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.416
A hill appears steeper
if you've just exercised,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.656
and a landmark appears farther away

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.360
if you're wearing a heavy backpack.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.840
We have arrived
at a fundamental contradiction.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.576
What you see is a complex
mental construction of your own making,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.376
but you experience it passively

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.800
as a direct representation
of the world around you.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.280
You create your own reality,
and you believe it.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.800
I believed mine until it broke apart.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.360
The deterioration of my eyes
shattered the illusion.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.016
You see, sight is just one way

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.720
we shape our reality.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.880
We create our own realities
in many other ways.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.120
Let's take fear as just one example.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.280
Your fears distort your reality.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.056
Under the warped logic of fear,
anything is better than the uncertain.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.536
Fear fills the void at all costs,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.696
passing off what you dread
for what you know,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.496
offering up the worst
in place of the ambiguous,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.280
substituting assumption for reason.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.856
Psychologists have
a great term for it: awfulizing.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.976
(Laughter)

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.536
Right?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.840
Fear replaces the unknown with the awful.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.976
Now, fear is self-realizing.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.736
When you face the greatest need

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.416
to look outside yourself
and think critically,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.256
fear beats a retreat
deep inside your mind,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.056
shrinking and distorting your view,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.136
drowning your capacity
for critical thought

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.880
with a flood of disruptive emotions.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.736
When you face a compelling
opportunity to take action,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.256
fear lulls you into inaction,

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.800
enticing you to passively watch
its prophecies fulfill themselves.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.096
When I was diagnosed
with my blinding disease,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.160
I knew blindness would ruin my life.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.336
Blindness was a death sentence
for my independence.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.240
It was the end of achievement for me.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.576
Blindness meant I would live
an unremarkable life,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.296
small and sad,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.520
and likely alone.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.480
I knew it.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.240
This was a fiction born of my fears,
but I believed it.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.416
It was a lie, but it was my reality,

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.600
just like those backwards-swimming fish
in little Dorothy's mind.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.416
If I had not confronted
the reality of my fear,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.640
I would have lived it.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.480
I am certain of that.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.440
So how do you live your life
eyes wide open?

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.960
It is a learned discipline.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.960
It can be taught. It can be practiced.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.109
I will summarize very briefly.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.536
Hold yourself accountable

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.056
for every moment, every thought,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.280
every detail.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.776
See beyond your fears.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.536
Recognize your assumptions.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.336
Harness your internal strength.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.536
Silence your internal critic.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.360
Correct your misconceptions
about luck and about success.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.920
Accept your strengths and your weaknesses,
and understand the difference.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.896
Open your hearts

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.320
to your bountiful blessings.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.696
Your fears, your critics,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.576
your heroes, your villains --

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.616
they are your excuses,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.976
rationalizations, shortcuts,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.320
justifications, your surrender.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.679
They are fictions you perceive as reality.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.655
Choose to see through them.

00:08:47.679 --> 00:08:48.919
Choose to let them go.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.039
You are the creator of your reality.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.280
With that empowerment
comes complete responsibility.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.560
I chose to step out of fear's tunnel
into terrain uncharted and undefined.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.840
I chose to build there a blessed life.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.896
Far from alone,

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.896
I share my beautiful life with Dorothy,

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.576
my beautiful wife,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.760
with our triplets,
whom we call the Tripskys,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.416
and with the latest addition
to the family,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.800
sweet baby Clementine.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.040
What do you fear?

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.360
What lies do you tell yourself?

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.440
How do you embellish your truth
and write your own fictions?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.840
What reality are you
creating for yourself?

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.376
In your career and personal life,
in your relationships,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.016
and in your heart and soul,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.440
your backwards-swimming fish
do you great harm.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.480
They exact a toll in missed opportunities
and unrealized potential,

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.776
and they engender insecurity and distrust

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.240
where you seek fulfillment and connection.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.760
I urge you to search them out.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.536
Helen Keller said that the only thing
worse than being blind

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.560
is having sight but no vision.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.696
For me, going blind
was a profound blessing,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.760
because blindness gave me vision.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.720
I hope you can see what I see.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.496
Thank you.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.680
(Applause)

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.896
Bruno Giussani: Isaac, before you
leave the stage, just a question.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.696
This is an audience of entrepreneurs,
of doers, of innovators.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.376
You are a CEO of a company
down in Florida,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.536
and many are probably wondering,

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.776
how is it to be a blind CEO?

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.576
What kind of specific challenges
do you have, and how do you overcome them?

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.736
Isaac Lidsky: Well,
the biggest challenge became a blessing.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.320
I don't get visual feedback from people.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.976
(Laughter)

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.176
BG: What's that noise there? IL: Yeah.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.696
So, for example,
in my leadership team meetings,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.080
I don't see facial
expressions or gestures.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.376
I've learned to solicit
a lot more verbal feedback.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.400
I basically force people
to tell me what they think.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.936
And in this respect,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.056
it's become, like I said, a real blessing
for me personally and for my company,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.680
because we communicate
at a far deeper level,

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.320
we avoid ambiguities,

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:36.010
and most important, my team knows
that what they think truly matters.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.456
BG: Isaac, thank you for coming to TED.
IL: Thank you, Bruno.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.185
(Applause)
