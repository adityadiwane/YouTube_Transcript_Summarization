00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm really scared. I don't think we're going to make it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Shortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
with the family. The conversation turned to global warming,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and everybody agreed, there's a real problem.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We've got a climate crisis.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So, we went around the table to talk about what we should do.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
She said, "I agree with everything that's been said.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm scared and I'm angry." And then she turned to me and said,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it." Wow.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
(Laughter)

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
"There is a time when panic is the appropriate response."

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
(Laughter)

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
this problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
we must act, and we must act decisively.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I've got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to try to do much more. So, we mobilized. We got on airplanes.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We went to Brazil. We went to China and to India,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to Bentonville, Arkansas, to Washington, D.C. and to Sacramento.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
about what we've learned in those journeys.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Because the more we learned, the more concerned we grew.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
like avian flu or personalized medicine,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
we just get together the smartest people we know.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
For this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
of superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and business leaders. Fifty or so of them.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And so, I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and four lessons I've learned in the last year.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The first lesson is that companies are really powerful,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and that matters a lot. This is a story about

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
how Wal-Mart went green, and what that means.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Two years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the next big thing, and so Wal-Mart made going green a top priority.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
They committed that they're going to take their existing stores

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So, look what they did.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
They painted the roofs of all their stores white.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
They put smart skylights through their stores

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And, third, they put the refrigerated goods

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
behind closed doors with LED lighting.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
These are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Why does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it's massive.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
They're the largest private employer in America.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
They're the largest private user of electricity.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
They have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
it would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
When Wal-Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
it has a powerful impact on other great institutions.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So, let me tell you this:

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
when Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
We need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and they matter enormously.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Wal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
That's a third of the U.S. population.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And Wal-Mart has committed they're going to sell

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
another 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Consumers don't really like these light bulbs.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The light's kind of funny, they won't dim,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
takes a while for them to start up.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But the pay-off is really enormous.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that we'll save 600 million dollars in energy bills,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
It's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
in Fiji and ship it here.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
(Laughter)

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It's hard to change consumer behavior

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Do you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I don't know, and I should.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Those of us who care about all this would act better

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
if we knew what the real costs were.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
But as long as we pretend that CO2 is free,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
as long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I'm really afraid, because I think the kinds of changes

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
we can reasonably expect from individuals

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
are going to be clearly not enough.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
The third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
In fact, policy is paramount.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I've got a behind-the-scenes story for you

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
about that green tech network I described.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
At the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
what the action items would be, how we'd follow up.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
You know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
is to make it clear in Sacramento, California

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that we need a market-based system of mandates

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It's necessary and, just as important,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
it's good for the California economy.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
You know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
so it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
(Applause)

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Please. Thank you.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Because California was the first state in this country

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And the result of that is, we're going to generate 83,000 new jobs,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
four billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
by 174 million tons a year.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It's only a percent and a half of the country's CO2 emissions. It's a great start,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
but I've got to tell you -- where I started -- I'm really afraid.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
In fact, I'm certain California's not enough.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
You know Tom Friedman says, "If you don't go, you don't know"?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Well, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
He's the father of the ethanol revolution.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
He told us that Brazil's government mandated

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And they mandated that their new vehicles

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
would be flex-fuel compatible, right?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And so, here's what's happened in Brazil.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
They now have 29,000 ethanol pumps --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
this versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California --

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and in three years their new car fleet

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
has gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Compare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And you know what? Most consumers who have them don't even know it.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So, what's happened in Brazil is, they've replaced

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
That's 59 billion dollars since 1975

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
that they didn't ship to the Middle East.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
It's created a million jobs inside that country,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
That's 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But Brazil's only 1.3 percent of the world's CO2 emission.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So, Brazil's ethanol miracle, I'm really afraid, is not enough.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
In fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
are not going to be enough.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
The fourth and final lesson we've learned

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
is about the potential of radical innovation.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So, I want to tell you about a tragic problem

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and a breakthrough technology.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Every year a million and a half people die of

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
a completely preventable disease. That's malaria. 6,000 people a day.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
All for want of two dollars' worth of medications

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that we can buy at the corner drugstore.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Well, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
So, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
from the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
to make the key ingredient, called artemisinin,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And in doing so, they'll save a million lives --

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
at least a million lives a year. A million lives.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
This leverages millions of years of evolution

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
by redesigning bugs to make really useful products.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Now, what you do is, you get inside the microbe,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
you change its metabolic pathways, and you end up with a living chemical factory.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Now, you may ask,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
John, what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Well, I'll tell you -- a lot.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
We've now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that they're using can be used to make better biofuels.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Don't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and optimize them along the way.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
So, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000
that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I guess that's better living through bugs.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Alan Kay is famous for saying

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
the best way to predict the future is to invent it.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
the second best way is to finance it.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And that's why we're investing 200 million dollars

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
for innovation in green technologies.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And we're encouraging others to do it as well.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
We're talking a lot about this.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
But I'm really afraid we need much, much more.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
For reference, fact one:

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Exxon's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Do you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&amp;D?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Second fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
is barely a billion dollars in total.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Less than one day of Exxon's revenues.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Third fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
for the next thousand years. And the federal budget

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&amp;D in geothermal energy.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
It is almost criminal that we are not investing more

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
in energy research in this country.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
So, in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Who would have thought that a mass retailer

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
could make money by going green? Who would have thought that

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
would come from a developing country in South America?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And who would have thought that scientists

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And who would have thought that all that is not enough?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Not enough to stabilize the climate.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
The scientists tell us -- and they're only guessing --

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
that we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and do it as fast as possible.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Now, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S.,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
but I've got to tell you, we've got only one atmosphere,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000
to do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
To size the problem, China's CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons;

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
we'll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
That's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And if it's business as usual, we're going out of business.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
When I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
about their CO2 strategy, and he said the following,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
"You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese."

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Then he asked, "Why should China sacrifice our growth

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?"

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Does anybody here have an answer for him? I don't.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
make the right outcome, the profitable outcome,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and therefore the likely outcome.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Energy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
It is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Well, I'll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green --

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
is bigger than the Internet.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Moreover, if we succeed, it's going to be

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
the most important transformation for life on the planet since,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
as Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Now, here's the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world's

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
companies and individuals and policies and innovation

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000
is not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don't know.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Everyone here cares about changing the world

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and has made a difference in that one way or another.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So, our call to action -- my call to you --

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
is for you to make going green your next big thing, your gig.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
What can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
lobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
There's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And the most important thing you can do, I think,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
is to use your personal power and your Rolodex

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
to lead your business, your institution, in going green.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Do it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
for its customers and its suppliers and for itself.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Really think outside the box.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
It could be bigger than Wal-Mart.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Because if we do, I can look forward

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
to the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:55.000
(Applause)
