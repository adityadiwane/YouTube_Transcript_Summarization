00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:17.262
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies,

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:22.487
fathers are usually known by their sons,

00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:25.703
but I'm one of the few fathers

00:00:25.703 --> 00:00:27.747
who is known by his daughter,

00:00:27.747 --> 00:00:29.373
and I am proud of it.

00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:33.542
(Applause)

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.658
Malala started her campaign for education

00:00:38.658 --> 00:00:41.545
and stood for her rights in 2007,

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:46.103
and when her efforts were honored in 2011,

00:00:46.103 --> 00:00:49.543
and she was given the national youth peace prize,

00:00:49.543 --> 00:00:51.412
and she became a very famous,

00:00:51.412 --> 00:00:55.456
very popular young girl of her country.

00:00:55.456 --> 00:00:58.784
Before that, she was my daughter,

00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:01.789
but now I am her father.

00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:04.496
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:04.496 --> 00:01:07.643
if we glance to human history,

00:01:07.643 --> 00:01:10.471
the story of women

00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:13.847
is the story of injustice,

00:01:13.847 --> 00:01:15.907
inequality,

00:01:15.907 --> 00:01:21.218
violence and exploitation.

00:01:21.218 --> 00:01:23.053
You see,

00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:27.204
in patriarchal societies,

00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:29.646
right from the very beginning,

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:32.652
when a girl is born,

00:01:32.652 --> 00:01:36.932
her birth is not celebrated.

00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:39.096
She is not welcomed,

00:01:39.096 --> 00:01:41.872
neither by father nor by mother.

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:43.557
The neighborhood comes

00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:46.058
and commiserates with the mother,

00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:51.152
and nobody congratulates the father.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:55.467
And a mother is very uncomfortable

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:59.834
for having a girl child.

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:03.094
When she gives birth to the first girl child,

00:02:03.094 --> 00:02:07.183
first daughter, she is sad.

00:02:07.183 --> 00:02:10.930
When she gives birth to the second daughter,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.777
she is shocked,

00:02:12.777 --> 00:02:16.161
and in the expectation of a son,

00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:19.367
when she gives birth to a third daughter,

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:24.906
she feels guilty like a criminal.

00:02:24.906 --> 00:02:27.540
Not only the mother suffers,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.277
but the daughter, the newly born daughter,

00:02:30.277 --> 00:02:32.412
when she grows old,

00:02:32.412 --> 00:02:34.547
she suffers too.

00:02:34.547 --> 00:02:36.600
At the age of five,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.929
while she should be going to school,

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:41.672
she stays at home

00:02:41.672 --> 00:02:46.294
and her brothers are admitted in a school.

00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:48.887
Until the age of 12, somehow,

00:02:48.887 --> 00:02:51.528
she has a good life.

00:02:51.528 --> 00:02:53.199
She can have fun.

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.388
She can play with her friends in the streets,

00:02:56.388 --> 00:02:58.427
and she can move around in the streets

00:02:58.427 --> 00:03:01.202
like a butterfly.

00:03:01.202 --> 00:03:05.017
But when she enters her teens,

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:07.357
when she becomes 13 years old,

00:03:07.357 --> 00:03:10.976
she is forbidden to go out of her home

00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:14.468
without a male escort.

00:03:14.468 --> 00:03:19.843
She is confined under the four walls of her home.

00:03:19.843 --> 00:03:25.037
She is no more a free individual.

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:28.057
She becomes the so-called honor

00:03:28.057 --> 00:03:30.538
of her father and of her brothers

00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:33.988
and of her family,

00:03:33.988 --> 00:03:36.676
and if she transgresses

00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:39.887
the code of that so-called honor,

00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:44.251
she could even be killed.

00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:48.252
And it is also interesting that this so-called

00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:49.615
code of honor,

00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:53.305
it does not only affect the life of a girl,

00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:55.431
it also affects the life

00:03:55.431 --> 00:04:00.230
of the male members of the family.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.823
I know a family of seven sisters and one brother,

00:04:06.823 --> 00:04:08.645
and that one brother,

00:04:08.645 --> 00:04:12.149
he has migrated to the Gulf countries,

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.844
to earn a living for his seven sisters

00:04:14.844 --> 00:04:17.192
and parents,

00:04:17.192 --> 00:04:23.046
because he thinks that it will be humiliating

00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:25.768
if his seven sisters learn a skill

00:04:25.768 --> 00:04:28.148
and they go out of the home

00:04:28.148 --> 00:04:32.299
and earn some livelihood.

00:04:32.299 --> 00:04:33.889
So this brother,

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.242
he sacrifices the joys of his life

00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:40.634
and the happiness of his sisters

00:04:40.634 --> 00:04:45.218
at the altar of so-called honor.

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:46.752
And there is one more norm

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:49.110
of the patriarchal societies

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.560
that is called obedience.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.346
A good girl is supposed to be

00:04:57.346 --> 00:05:02.594
very quiet, very humble

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:06.565
and very submissive.

00:05:06.565 --> 00:05:07.904
It is the criteria.

00:05:07.904 --> 00:05:11.736
The role model good girl should be very quiet.

00:05:11.736 --> 00:05:14.025
She is supposed to be silent

00:05:14.025 --> 00:05:17.196
and she is supposed to accept the decisions

00:05:17.196 --> 00:05:19.416
of her father and mother

00:05:19.416 --> 00:05:22.641
and the decisions of elders,

00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:25.047
even if she does not like them.

00:05:25.047 --> 00:05:28.376
If she is married to a man she doesn't like

00:05:28.376 --> 00:05:31.118
or if she is married to an old man,

00:05:31.118 --> 00:05:32.678
she has to accept,

00:05:32.678 --> 00:05:35.196
because she does not want to be dubbed

00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:37.819
as disobedient.

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:39.451
If she is married very early,

00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:40.925
she has to accept.

00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:44.947
Otherwise, she will be called disobedient.

00:05:44.947 --> 00:05:47.750
And what happens at the end?

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.505
In the words of a poetess,

00:05:49.505 --> 00:05:52.292
she is wedded, bedded,

00:05:52.292 --> 00:05:57.463
and then she gives birth
to more sons and daughters.

00:05:57.463 --> 00:06:00.232
And it is the irony of the situation

00:06:00.232 --> 00:06:02.564
that this mother,

00:06:02.564 --> 00:06:05.616
she teaches the same lesson of obedience

00:06:05.616 --> 00:06:06.676
to her daughter

00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:11.109
and the same lesson of honor to her sons.

00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:16.222
And this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.

00:06:17.997 --> 00:06:20.524
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:06:20.524 --> 00:06:23.746
this plight of millions of women

00:06:23.746 --> 00:06:26.578
could be changed

00:06:26.578 --> 00:06:28.953
if we think differently,

00:06:28.953 --> 00:06:32.934
if women and men think differently,

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:37.152
if men and women in the
tribal and patriarchal societies

00:06:37.152 --> 00:06:39.135
in the developing countries,

00:06:39.135 --> 00:06:42.046
if they can break a few norms

00:06:42.046 --> 00:06:46.650
of family and society,

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:52.130
if they can abolish the discriminatory laws

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.658
of the systems in their states,

00:06:54.658 --> 00:06:56.949
which go against the basic human rights

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:00.743
of the women.

00:07:00.743 --> 00:07:05.987
Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born,

00:07:05.987 --> 00:07:08.140
and for the first time,

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.414
believe me,

00:07:09.414 --> 00:07:14.391
I don't like newborn children, to be honest,

00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:18.173
but when I went and I looked into her eyes,

00:07:18.173 --> 00:07:20.293
believe me,

00:07:20.293 --> 00:07:24.274
I got extremely honored.

00:07:24.274 --> 00:07:26.444
And long before she was born,

00:07:26.444 --> 00:07:29.480
I thought about her name,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.765
and I was fascinated with a heroic

00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:36.630
legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.639
Her name was Malalai of Maiwand,

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:45.924
and I named my daughter after her.

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.916
A few days after Malala was born,

00:07:48.916 --> 00:07:50.655
my daughter was born,

00:07:50.655 --> 00:07:52.313
my cousin came --

00:07:52.313 --> 00:07:54.281
and it was a coincidence --

00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:56.996
he came to my home

00:07:56.996 --> 00:07:59.701
and he brought a family tree,

00:07:59.701 --> 00:08:03.369
a family tree of the Yousafzai family,

00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:05.925
and when I looked at the family tree,

00:08:05.925 --> 00:08:11.978
it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.

00:08:11.978 --> 00:08:16.375
But when I looked, all were men,

00:08:16.375 --> 00:08:18.797
and I picked my pen,

00:08:18.797 --> 00:08:20.801
drew a line from my name,

00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:24.500
and wrote, "Malala."

00:08:25.585 --> 00:08:28.355
And when she grow old,

00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:31.938
when she was four and a half years old,

00:08:31.938 --> 00:08:35.474
I admitted her in my school.

00:08:35.474 --> 00:08:38.380
You will be asking, then, why should I mention about

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.882
the admission of a girl in a school?

00:08:40.882 --> 00:08:42.937
Yes, I must mention it.

00:08:42.937 --> 00:08:46.022
It may be taken for granted in Canada,

00:08:46.022 --> 00:08:49.849
in America, in many developed countries,

00:08:49.849 --> 00:08:52.307
but in poor countries,

00:08:52.307 --> 00:08:55.875
in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies,

00:08:55.875 --> 00:08:59.489
it's a big event for the life of girl.

00:08:59.489 --> 00:09:03.128
Enrollment in a school means

00:09:03.128 --> 00:09:08.877
recognition of her identity and her name.

00:09:08.877 --> 00:09:10.555
Admission in a school means

00:09:10.555 --> 00:09:14.237
that she has entered the world of dreams

00:09:14.237 --> 00:09:15.900
and aspirations

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.412
where she can explore her potentials

00:09:19.412 --> 00:09:22.658
for her future life.

00:09:22.658 --> 00:09:24.737
I have five sisters,

00:09:24.737 --> 00:09:28.051
and none of them could go to school,

00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:29.625
and you will be astonished,

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:33.719
two weeks before,

00:09:33.735 --> 00:09:38.018
when I was filling out the Canadian visa form,

00:09:38.018 --> 00:09:42.683
and I was filling out the family part of the form,

00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:44.767
I could not recall

00:09:44.767 --> 00:09:48.772
the surnames of some of my sisters.

00:09:48.772 --> 00:09:50.621
And the reason was

00:09:50.621 --> 00:09:53.913
that I have never, never seen the names

00:09:53.913 --> 00:09:59.739
of my sisters written on any document.

00:09:59.739 --> 00:10:02.679
That was the reason that

00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:06.212
I valued my daughter.

00:10:06.212 --> 00:10:10.525
What my father could not give to my sisters

00:10:10.525 --> 00:10:12.280
and to his daughters,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.521
I thought I must change it.

00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:19.528
I used to appreciate the intelligence

00:10:19.528 --> 00:10:23.200
and the brilliance of my daughter.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.794
I encouraged her to sit with me

00:10:25.794 --> 00:10:27.453
when my friends used to come.

00:10:27.453 --> 00:10:32.237
I encouraged her to go with
me to different meetings.

00:10:32.237 --> 00:10:33.898
And all these good values,

00:10:33.898 --> 00:10:37.108
I tried to inculcate in her personality.

00:10:37.108 --> 00:10:40.771
And this was not only she, only Malala.

00:10:40.771 --> 00:10:43.507
I imparted all these good values

00:10:43.507 --> 00:10:48.050
to my school, girl students 
and boy students as well.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.429
I used education for emancipation.

00:10:52.429 --> 00:10:54.294
I taught my girls,

00:10:54.294 --> 00:10:56.249
I taught my girl students,

00:10:56.249 --> 00:11:01.318
to unlearn the lesson of obedience.

00:11:01.318 --> 00:11:04.283
I taught my boy students

00:11:04.283 --> 00:11:09.764
to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.

00:11:13.696 --> 00:11:17.681
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:11:17.681 --> 00:11:22.264
we were striving for more rights for women,

00:11:22.264 --> 00:11:25.886
and we were struggling to have more,

00:11:25.886 --> 00:11:30.113
more and more space for the women in society.

00:11:30.113 --> 00:11:33.326
But we came across a new phenomenon.

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:35.819
It was lethal to human rights

00:11:35.819 --> 00:11:39.267
and particularly to women's rights.

00:11:39.267 --> 00:11:43.944
It was called Talibanization.

00:11:43.944 --> 00:11:47.632
It means a complete negation

00:11:47.632 --> 00:11:49.842
of women's participation

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:56.037
in all political, economical and social activities.

00:11:56.037 --> 00:11:59.584
Hundreds of schools were lost.

00:11:59.584 --> 00:12:05.815
Girls were prohibited from going to school.

00:12:05.815 --> 00:12:09.521
Women were forced to wear veils

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:13.077
and they were stopped from going to the markets.

00:12:13.077 --> 00:12:15.661
Musicians were silenced,

00:12:15.661 --> 00:12:17.618
girls were flogged

00:12:17.618 --> 00:12:21.101
and singers were killed.

00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:22.975
Millions were suffering,

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:26.220
but few spoke,

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.444
and it was the most scary thing

00:12:28.444 --> 00:12:34.530
when you have all around such people

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.556
who kill and who flog,

00:12:36.556 --> 00:12:37.852
and you speak for your rights.

00:12:37.852 --> 00:12:42.059
It's really the most scary thing.

00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:43.952
At the age of 10,

00:12:43.952 --> 00:12:48.196
Malala stood, and she stood for the right

00:12:48.196 --> 00:12:50.507
of education.

00:12:50.507 --> 00:12:55.279
She wrote a diary for the BBC blog,

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.483
she volunteered herself

00:12:57.483 --> 00:13:01.077
for the New York Times documentaries,

00:13:01.077 --> 00:13:05.993
and she spoke from every platform she could.

00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:10.381
And her voice was the most powerful voice.

00:13:10.381 --> 00:13:16.634
It spread like a crescendo all around the world.

00:13:16.634 --> 00:13:18.486
And that was the reason the Taliban

00:13:18.486 --> 00:13:22.817
could not tolerate her campaign,

00:13:22.817 --> 00:13:25.666
and on October 9 2012,

00:13:25.666 --> 00:13:31.415
she was shot in the head at point blank range.

00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:35.560
It was a doomsday for my family and for me.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:41.379
The world turned into a big black hole.

00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:43.045
While my daughter was

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:46.497
on the verge of life and death,

00:13:46.497 --> 00:13:50.336
I whispered into the ears of my wife,

00:13:50.336 --> 00:13:53.438
"Should I be blamed for what happened

00:13:53.438 --> 00:13:57.114
to my daughter and your daughter?"

00:13:57.114 --> 00:13:59.635
And she abruptly told me,

00:13:59.635 --> 00:14:02.146
"Please don't blame yourself.

00:14:02.146 --> 00:14:05.362
You stood for the right cause.

00:14:05.362 --> 00:14:07.497
You put your life at stake

00:14:07.497 --> 00:14:08.900
for the cause of truth,

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.081
for the cause of peace,

00:14:10.081 --> 00:14:12.189
and for the cause of education,

00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:14.238
and your daughter in inspired from you

00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:16.469
and she joined you.

00:14:16.469 --> 00:14:18.144
You both were on the right path

00:14:18.144 --> 00:14:21.517
and God will protect her."

00:14:21.517 --> 00:14:24.863
These few words meant a lot to me,

00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:28.974
and I didn't ask this question again.

00:14:28.974 --> 00:14:33.094
When Malala was in the hospital,

00:14:33.094 --> 00:14:36.341
and she was going through the severe pains

00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:38.861
and she had had severe headaches

00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:42.049
because her facial nerve was cut down,

00:14:42.049 --> 00:14:44.501
I used to see a dark shadow

00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:50.038
spreading on the face of my wife.

00:14:50.038 --> 00:14:56.139
But my daughter never complained.

00:14:56.139 --> 00:14:58.200
She used to tell us,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.251
"I'm fine with my crooked smile

00:15:00.251 --> 00:15:02.993
and with my numbness in my face.

00:15:02.993 --> 00:15:05.072
I'll be okay. Please don't worry."

00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:07.201
She was a solace for us,

00:15:07.201 --> 00:15:10.098
and she consoled us.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.341
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:18.963
we learned from her how to be resilient

00:15:18.963 --> 00:15:22.268
in the most difficult times,

00:15:22.268 --> 00:15:25.276
and I'm glad to share with you

00:15:25.276 --> 00:15:31.168
that despite being an icon

00:15:31.168 --> 00:15:33.997
for the rights of children and women,

00:15:33.997 --> 00:15:39.290
she is like any 16-year old girl.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:44.422
She cries when her homework is incomplete.

00:15:44.422 --> 00:15:46.490
She quarrels with her brothers,

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:50.213
and I am very happy for that.

00:15:50.213 --> 00:15:52.616
People ask me,

00:15:52.616 --> 00:15:56.108
what special is in my mentorship

00:15:56.108 --> 00:15:58.648
which has made Malala so bold

00:15:58.648 --> 00:16:03.140
and so courageous and so vocal and poised?

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:09.415
I tell them, don't ask me what I did.

00:16:09.415 --> 00:16:13.276
Ask me what I did not do.

00:16:13.276 --> 00:16:18.533
I did not clip her wings, and that's all.

00:16:18.533 --> 00:16:21.415
Thank you very much.

00:16:21.415 --> 00:16:26.911
(Applause)

00:16:26.911 --> 00:16:30.911
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause)
