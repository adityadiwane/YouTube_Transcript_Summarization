00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:15.652
So why do we learn mathematics?

00:00:15.652 --> 00:00:18.200
Essentially, for three reasons:

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.828
calculation,

00:00:19.828 --> 00:00:21.728
application,

00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:24.415
and last, and unfortunately least

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:26.520
in terms of the time we give it,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.442
inspiration.

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:30.714
Mathematics is the science of patterns,

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:34.072
and we study it to learn how to think logically,

00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:36.599
critically and creatively,

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:39.525
but too much of the mathematics
that we learn in school

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:41.844
is not effectively motivated,

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:43.269
and when our students ask,

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.944
"Why are we learning this?"

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:46.905
then they often hear that they'll need it

00:00:46.905 --> 00:00:50.170
in an upcoming math class or on a future test.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.972
But wouldn't it be great

00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:54.490
if every once in a while we did mathematics

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.439
simply because it was fun or beautiful

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.529
or because it excited the mind?

00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:01.251
Now, I know many people have not

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:03.570
had the opportunity to see how this can happen,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.399
so let me give you a quick example

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.740
with my favorite collection of numbers,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.468
the Fibonacci numbers. (Applause)

00:01:10.468 --> 00:01:12.520
Yeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.836
That's great.

00:01:13.836 --> 00:01:15.952
Now these numbers can be appreciated

00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:17.830
in many different ways.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.539
From the standpoint of calculation,

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.216
they're as easy to understand

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.770
as one plus one, which is two.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.773
Then one plus two is three,

00:01:26.773 --> 00:01:29.787
two plus three is five, three plus five is eight,

00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:31.312
and so on.

00:01:31.312 --> 00:01:33.489
Indeed, the person we call Fibonacci

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:36.669
was actually named Leonardo of Pisa,

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:39.722
and these numbers appear in his book "Liber Abaci,"

00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:41.372
which taught the Western world

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:44.199
the methods of arithmetic that we use today.

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:45.920
In terms of applications,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.103
Fibonacci numbers appear in nature

00:01:48.103 --> 00:01:49.960
surprisingly often.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.700
The number of petals on a flower

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.562
is typically a Fibonacci number,

00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:56.332
or the number of spirals on a sunflower

00:01:56.332 --> 00:01:57.743
or a pineapple

00:01:57.743 --> 00:02:00.137
tends to be a Fibonacci number as well.

00:02:00.137 --> 00:02:03.640
In fact, there are many more
applications of Fibonacci numbers,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.200
but what I find most inspirational about them

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.934
are the beautiful number patterns they display.

00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:11.128
Let me show you one of my favorites.

00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:13.349
Suppose you like to square numbers,

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.024
and frankly, who doesn't? (Laughter)

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.280
Let's look at the squares

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.131
of the first few Fibonacci numbers.

00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:22.161
So one squared is one,

00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:24.478
two squared is four, three squared is nine,

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:27.651
five squared is 25, and so on.

00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:29.552
Now, it's no surprise

00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:32.380
that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.412
you get the next Fibonacci number. Right?

00:02:34.412 --> 00:02:35.807
That's how they're created.

00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:37.580
But you wouldn't expect anything special

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.656
to happen when you add the squares together.

00:02:40.656 --> 00:02:42.002
But check this out.

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:44.003
One plus one gives us two,

00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.765
and one plus four gives us five.

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:48.960
And four plus nine is 13,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.173
nine plus 25 is 34,

00:02:52.173 --> 00:02:54.832
and yes, the pattern continues.

00:02:54.832 --> 00:02:56.453
In fact, here's another one.

00:02:56.453 --> 00:02:58.297
Suppose you wanted to look at

00:02:58.297 --> 00:03:00.795
adding the squares of
the first few Fibonacci numbers.

00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:02.403
Let's see what we get there.

00:03:02.403 --> 00:03:04.542
So one plus one plus four is six.

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:07.547
Add nine to that, we get 15.

00:03:07.547 --> 00:03:09.760
Add 25, we get 40.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.551
Add 64, we get 104.

00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:14.203
Now look at those numbers.

00:03:14.203 --> 00:03:16.587
Those are not Fibonacci numbers,

00:03:16.587 --> 00:03:18.466
but if you look at them closely,

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:20.349
you'll see the Fibonacci numbers

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.527
buried inside of them.

00:03:22.527 --> 00:03:24.597
Do you see it? I'll show it to you.

00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:28.330
Six is two times three, 15 is three times five,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.389
40 is five times eight,

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.317
two, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate?

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:34.504
(Laughter)

00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:36.659
Fibonacci! Of course.

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.442
Now, as much fun as it is to discover these patterns,

00:03:40.442 --> 00:03:42.924
it's even more satisfying to understand

00:03:42.924 --> 00:03:44.882
why they are true.

00:03:44.882 --> 00:03:46.771
Let's look at that last equation.

00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:50.639
Why should the squares of one, one,
two, three, five and eight

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.184
add up to eight times 13?

00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:56.145
I'll show you by drawing a simple picture.

00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:58.832
We'll start with a one-by-one square

00:03:58.832 --> 00:04:02.997
and next to that put another one-by-one square.

00:04:02.997 --> 00:04:06.405
Together, they form a one-by-two rectangle.

00:04:06.405 --> 00:04:08.954
Beneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square,

00:04:08.954 --> 00:04:11.749
and next to that, a three-by-three square,

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:13.750
beneath that, a five-by-five square,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.662
and then an eight-by-eight square,

00:04:15.662 --> 00:04:18.234
creating one giant rectangle, right?

00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:20.150
Now let me ask you a simple question:

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.806
what is the area of the rectangle?

00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:25.777
Well, on the one hand,

00:04:25.777 --> 00:04:28.307
it's the sum of the areas

00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:30.173
of the squares inside it, right?

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:31.532
Just as we created it.

00:04:31.532 --> 00:04:33.704
It's one squared plus one squared

00:04:33.704 --> 00:04:35.937
plus two squared plus three squared

00:04:35.937 --> 00:04:38.536
plus five squared plus eight squared. Right?

00:04:38.536 --> 00:04:40.393
That's the area.

00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:42.719
On the other hand, because it's a rectangle,

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:46.367
the area is equal to its height times its base,

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:48.414
and the height is clearly eight,

00:04:48.414 --> 00:04:51.317
and the base is five plus eight,

00:04:51.317 --> 00:04:55.255
which is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right?

00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:58.618
So the area is also eight times 13.

00:04:58.618 --> 00:05:00.880
Since we've correctly calculated the area

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.567
two different ways,

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:04.739
they have to be the same number,

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:08.130
and that's why the squares of one,
one, two, three, five and eight

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.421
add up to eight times 13.

00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:12.795
Now, if we continue this process,

00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:16.773
we'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21,

00:05:16.773 --> 00:05:19.167
21 by 34, and so on.

00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:20.576
Now check this out.

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:22.769
If you divide 13 by eight,

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:24.812
you get 1.625.

00:05:24.812 --> 00:05:28.239
And if you divide the larger number
by the smaller number,

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:31.112
then these ratios get closer and closer

00:05:31.112 --> 00:05:33.765
to about 1.618,

00:05:33.765 --> 00:05:37.066
known to many people as the Golden Ratio,

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:39.662
a number which has fascinated mathematicians,

00:05:39.662 --> 00:05:42.908
scientists and artists for centuries.

00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:45.139
Now, I show all this to you because,

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.164
like so much of mathematics,

00:05:47.164 --> 00:05:49.131
there's a beautiful side to it

00:05:49.131 --> 00:05:51.146
that I fear does not get enough attention

00:05:51.146 --> 00:05:52.713
in our schools.

00:05:52.713 --> 00:05:55.546
We spend lots of time learning about calculation,

00:05:55.546 --> 00:05:58.302
but let's not forget about application,

00:05:58.302 --> 00:06:01.756
including, perhaps, the most
important application of all,

00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:03.832
learning how to think.

00:06:03.832 --> 00:06:05.789
If I could summarize this in one sentence,

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.250
it would be this:

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.610
Mathematics is not just solving for x,

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.535
it's also figuring out why.

00:06:13.535 --> 00:06:15.350
Thank you very much.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.757
(Applause)
