00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.406
If you're here today --

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.364
and I'm very happy that you are --

00:00:29.388 --> 00:00:31.741
you've all heard about
how sustainable development

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.727
will save us from ourselves.

00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:37.250
However, when we're not at TED,
we are often told

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:41.183
that a real sustainability policy agenda
is just not feasible,

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.976
especially in large urban areas
like New York City.

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.665
And that's because most people
with decision-making powers,

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:49.919
in both the public and the private sector,

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:52.229
really don't feel
as though they're in danger.

00:00:52.578 --> 00:00:56.671
The reason why I'm here today,
in part, is because of a dog --

00:00:56.695 --> 00:00:59.973
an abandoned puppy I found
back in the rain, back in 1998.

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:02.976
She turned out to be
a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.

00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:07.406
When she came into my life, we were
fighting against a huge waste facility

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.892
planned for the East River waterfront

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:12.426
despite the fact that
our small part of New York City

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.808
already handled more than 40 percent
of the entire city's commercial waste:

00:01:16.832 --> 00:01:21.976
a sewage treatment pelletizing plant,
a sewage sludge plant, four power plants,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.335
the world's largest
food-distribution center,

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.541
as well as other industries that bring
more than 60,000 diesel truck trips

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:29.721
to the area each week.

00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:34.086
The area also has one of the lowest ratios
of parks to people in the city.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.403
So when I was contacted
by the Parks Department

00:01:36.427 --> 00:01:40.585
about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative
to help develop waterfront projects,

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.523
I thought they were really
well-meaning, but a bit naive.

00:01:43.547 --> 00:01:47.214
I'd lived in this area all my life,
and you could not get to the river,

00:01:47.238 --> 00:01:50.531
because of all the lovely facilities
that I mentioned earlier.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:52.815
Then, while jogging
with my dog one morning,

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:55.950
she pulled me into what I thought
was just another illegal dump.

00:01:56.606 --> 00:02:00.383
There were weeds and piles of garbage
and other stuff that I won't mention here,

00:02:00.407 --> 00:02:01.621
but she kept dragging me,

00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:04.517
and lo and behold, at the end
of that lot was the river.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.642
I knew that this forgotten
little street-end,

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:09.670
abandoned like the dog that brought
me there, was worth saving.

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:12.290
And I knew it would grow
to become the proud beginnings

00:02:12.314 --> 00:02:15.298
of the community-led revitalization
of the new South Bronx.

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:19.301
And just like my new dog, it was an idea
that got bigger than I'd imagined.

00:02:19.325 --> 00:02:21.460
We garnered much support along the way,

00:02:21.484 --> 00:02:24.644
and the Hunts Point Riverside Park
became the first waterfront park

00:02:24.668 --> 00:02:27.067
that the South Bronx had had
in more than 60 years.

00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:30.457
We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant
more than 300 times,

00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:32.721
into a $3 million park.

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:37.673
And in the fall, I'm going to exchange
marriage vows with my beloved.

00:02:37.697 --> 00:02:38.697
(Audience whistles)

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:39.989
Thank you very much.

00:02:40.013 --> 00:02:44.555
(Applause)

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.976
That's him pressing my buttons
back there, which he does all the time.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.464
(Laughter)

00:02:50.488 --> 00:02:53.805
(Applause)

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.607
But those of us living
in environmental justice communities

00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:58.186
are the canary in the coal mine.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.621
We feel the problems right now,
and have for some time.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.976
Environmental justice, for those of you
who may not be familiar with the term,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.200
goes something like this:

00:03:07.224 --> 00:03:10.215
no community should be saddled
with more environmental burdens

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.905
and less environmental benefits
than any other.

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.976
Unfortunately, race and class
are extremely reliable indicators

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.037
as to where one might find the good stuff,
like parks and trees,

00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:23.793
and where one might find the bad stuff,
like power plants and waste facilities.

00:03:23.817 --> 00:03:27.052
As a black person in America,
I am twice as likely as a white person

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:30.673
to live in an area where air pollution
poses the greatest risk to my health.

00:03:30.697 --> 00:03:33.480
I am five times more likely
to live within walking distance

00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:35.413
of a power plant or chemical facility,

00:03:35.437 --> 00:03:36.594
which I do.

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:39.780
These land-use decisions
created the hostile conditions

00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:42.796
that lead to problems like obesity,
diabetes and asthma.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.721
Why would someone leave their home to go
for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:49.656
Our 27 percent obesity rate
is high even for this country,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.093
and diabetes comes with it.

00:03:51.117 --> 00:03:53.625
One out of four South Bronx
children has asthma.

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:55.464
Our asthma hospitalization rate

00:03:55.488 --> 00:03:57.771
is seven times higher
than the national average.

00:03:57.795 --> 00:03:59.746
These impacts are coming everyone's way.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.976
And we all pay dearly
for solid waste costs,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.976
health problems associated
with pollution and more odiously,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.989
the cost of imprisoning
our young black and Latino men,

00:04:08.013 --> 00:04:10.768
who possess untold amounts
of untapped potential.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.872
Fifty percent of our residents
live at or below the poverty line;

00:04:13.896 --> 00:04:15.651
25 percent of us are unemployed.

00:04:15.675 --> 00:04:19.698
Low-income citizens often use
emergency-room visits as primary care.

00:04:19.722 --> 00:04:23.621
This comes at a high cost to taxpayers
and produces no proportional benefits.

00:04:23.645 --> 00:04:27.488
Poor people are not only still poor,
they are still unhealthy.

00:04:27.512 --> 00:04:31.297
Fortunately, there are many people
like me who are striving for solutions

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:32.821
that won't compromise the lives

00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:35.345
of low-income communities of color
in the short term,

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:37.475
and won't destroy us all in the long term.

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:39.985
None of us want that,
and we all have that in common.

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.648
So what else do we have in common?

00:04:41.672 --> 00:04:44.450
Well, first of all,
we're all incredibly good-looking.

00:04:44.474 --> 00:04:45.661
(Laughter)

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:48.472
Graduated high school, college,
post-graduate degrees,

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.808
traveled to interesting places,
didn't have kids in your early teens,

00:04:51.832 --> 00:04:54.450
financially stable, never been imprisoned.

00:04:55.688 --> 00:04:56.848
OK. Good.

00:04:56.872 --> 00:04:58.211
(Laughter)

00:04:58.235 --> 00:04:59.842
But, besides being a black woman,

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:02.528
I am different from most of you
in some other ways.

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:05.943
I watched nearly half of the buildings
in my neighborhood burn down.

00:05:05.967 --> 00:05:07.930
My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam,

00:05:07.954 --> 00:05:10.859
only to be gunned down
a few blocks from our home.

00:05:13.992 --> 00:05:15.247
Jesus.

00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:18.217
I grew up with a crack house
across the street.

00:05:19.796 --> 00:05:22.495
Yeah, I'm a poor black child
from the ghetto.

00:05:23.784 --> 00:05:25.951
These things make me different from you.

00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:27.838
But the things we have in common

00:05:27.862 --> 00:05:30.601
set me apart from most
of the people in my community,

00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:32.451
and I am in between these two worlds

00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:35.362
with enough of my heart
to fight for justice in the other.

00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:38.323
So how did things get so different for us?

00:05:38.347 --> 00:05:41.678
In the late '40s, my dad --
a Pullman porter, son of a slave --

00:05:41.702 --> 00:05:44.569
bought a house in the Hunts Point
section of the South Bronx,

00:05:44.593 --> 00:05:46.608
and a few years later, he married my mom.

00:05:46.632 --> 00:05:50.113
At the time, the community was a mostly
white, working-class neighborhood.

00:05:50.137 --> 00:05:51.663
My dad was not alone.

00:05:51.687 --> 00:05:55.124
And as others like him pursued
their own version of the American dream,

00:05:55.148 --> 00:05:57.677
white flight became common
in the South Bronx

00:05:57.701 --> 00:05:59.701
and in many cities around the country.

00:06:00.018 --> 00:06:03.651
Red-lining was used by banks,
wherein certain sections of the city,

00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:07.664
including ours, were deemed
off-limits to any sort of investment.

00:06:07.688 --> 00:06:11.156
Many landlords believed it was more
profitable to torch their buildings

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.351
and collect insurance money rather
than to sell under those conditions --

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.815
dead or injured former tenants
notwithstanding.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.681
Hunts Point was formerly
a walk-to-work community,

00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:24.631
but now residents had neither
work nor home to walk to.

00:06:24.655 --> 00:06:27.841
A national highway construction boom
was added to our problems.

00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:29.016
In New York State,

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.823
Robert Moses spearheaded
an aggressive highway-expansion campaign.

00:06:32.847 --> 00:06:35.043
One of its primary goals was
to make it easier

00:06:35.067 --> 00:06:40.092
for residents of wealthy communities
in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.

00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:43.191
The South Bronx, which lies in between,
did not stand a chance.

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:45.765
Residents were often given
less than a month's notice

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:47.419
before their buildings were razed.

00:06:47.443 --> 00:06:49.767
600,000 people were displaced.

00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:51.101
The common perception was

00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:54.976
that only pimps and pushers
and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.930
And if you are told
from your earliest days

00:06:57.954 --> 00:07:00.571
that nothing good is going to come
from your community,

00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:01.746
that it's bad and ugly,

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.860
how could it not reflect on you?

00:07:04.335 --> 00:07:06.853
So now, my family's property
was worthless,

00:07:06.877 --> 00:07:09.519
save for that it was our home,
and all we had.

00:07:09.543 --> 00:07:13.269
And luckily for me, that home
and the love inside of it,

00:07:13.293 --> 00:07:18.435
along with help from teachers, mentors
and friends along the way, was enough.

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:20.148
Now, why is this story important?

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:21.982
Because from a planning perspective,

00:07:22.006 --> 00:07:25.723
economic degradation
begets environmental degradation,

00:07:25.747 --> 00:07:28.263
which begets social degradation.

00:07:28.287 --> 00:07:31.350
The disinvestment that began
in the 1960s set the stage

00:07:31.374 --> 00:07:33.976
for all the environmental
injustices that were to come.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.976
Antiquated zoning and land-use
regulations are still used to this day

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.043
to continue putting polluting
facilities in my neighborhood.

00:07:41.067 --> 00:07:44.845
Are these factors taken into consideration
when land-use policy is decided?

00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:47.465
What costs are associated
with these decisions?

00:07:47.489 --> 00:07:49.725
And who pays? Who profits?

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:53.368
Does anything justify
what the local community goes through?

00:07:53.392 --> 00:07:55.686
This was "planning" -- in quotes --

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.978
that did not have
our best interests in mind.

00:07:58.002 --> 00:08:01.417
Once we realized that, we decided
it was time to do our own planning.

00:08:01.441 --> 00:08:03.385
That small park I told you about earlier

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:06.687
was the first stage of building
a Greenway movement in the South Bronx.

00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:10.063
I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million
dollar federal transportation grant

00:08:10.087 --> 00:08:12.195
to design the plan
for a waterfront esplanade

00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:13.949
with dedicated on-street bike paths.

00:08:13.973 --> 00:08:17.431
Physical improvements help inform
public policy regarding traffic safety,

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:19.700
the placement of the waste
and other facilities,

00:08:19.724 --> 00:08:23.196
which, if done properly, don't compromise
a community's quality of life.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.934
They provide opportunities
to be more physically active,

00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.391
as well as local economic development.

00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:29.987
Think bike shops, juice stands.

00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:32.882
We secured 20 million dollars
to build first-phase projects.

00:08:32.906 --> 00:08:34.780
This is Lafayette Avenue --

00:08:34.804 --> 00:08:37.961
and that's redesigned
by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.

00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:41.006
And once this path is constructed,
it'll connect the South Bronx

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.379
with more than 400 acres
of Randall's Island Park.

00:08:43.403 --> 00:08:47.377
Right now we're separated by about 25 feet
of water, but this link will change that.

00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:51.665
As we nurture the natural environment,
its abundance will give us back even more.

00:08:51.689 --> 00:08:55.500
We run a project called the Bronx
[Environmental] Stewardship Training,

00:08:55.524 --> 00:08:58.831
which provides job training in the fields
of ecological restoration,

00:08:58.855 --> 00:09:01.656
so that folks from our community
have the skills to compete

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.019
for these well-paying jobs.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:06.380
Little by little, we're seeding
the area with green-collar jobs --

00:09:06.404 --> 00:09:09.263
and with people that have both
a financial and personal stake

00:09:09.287 --> 00:09:10.444
in their environment.

00:09:10.468 --> 00:09:13.111
The Sheridan Expressway
is an underutilized relic

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:14.334
of the Robert Moses era,

00:09:14.358 --> 00:09:17.734
built with no regard for the neighborhoods
that were divided by it.

00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:20.527
Even during rush hour,
it goes virtually unused.

00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:23.223
The community created
an alternative transportation plan

00:09:23.247 --> 00:09:25.873
that allows for the removal
of the highway.

00:09:25.897 --> 00:09:29.020
We have the opportunity now to bring
together all the stakeholders

00:09:29.044 --> 00:09:31.632
to re-envision how this 28 acres
can be better utilized

00:09:31.656 --> 00:09:34.698
for parkland, affordable housing
and local economic development.

00:09:34.722 --> 00:09:39.549
We also built New York City's first green
and cool roof demonstration project

00:09:39.573 --> 00:09:40.961
on top of our offices.

00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:44.450
Cool roofs are highly-reflective
surfaces that don't absorb solar heat,

00:09:44.474 --> 00:09:46.577
and pass it on to
the building or atmosphere.

00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:48.633
Green roofs are soil and living plants.

00:09:48.657 --> 00:09:51.904
Both can be used instead
of petroleum-based roofing materials

00:09:51.928 --> 00:09:54.699
that absorb heat, contribute
to urban "heat island" effect

00:09:54.723 --> 00:09:56.048
and degrade under the sun,

00:09:56.072 --> 00:09:57.294
which we in turn breathe.

00:09:57.318 --> 00:09:59.976
Green roofs also retain
up to 75 percent of rainfall,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.659
so they reduce a city's need to fund
costly end-of-pipe solutions --

00:10:03.683 --> 00:10:05.503
which, incidentally, are often located

00:10:05.527 --> 00:10:07.748
in environmental justice
communities like mine.

00:10:07.772 --> 00:10:11.072
And they provide habitats
for our little friends!

00:10:11.096 --> 00:10:12.253
[Butterfly]

00:10:12.277 --> 00:10:13.500
(Laughter)

00:10:13.524 --> 00:10:14.707
So cool!

00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:17.237
Anyway, the demonstration
project is a springboard

00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:19.385
for our own green roof
installation business,

00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:22.911
bringing jobs and sustainable
economic activity to the South Bronx.

00:10:22.935 --> 00:10:24.311
[Green is the new black ...]

00:10:24.335 --> 00:10:28.478
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:28.502 --> 00:10:30.153
I like that, too.

00:10:30.177 --> 00:10:33.873
Anyway, I know Chris told us
not to do pitches up here,

00:10:33.897 --> 00:10:35.777
but since I have all of your attention:

00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.388
We need investors. End of pitch.

00:10:37.412 --> 00:10:39.800
It's better to ask
for forgiveness than permission.

00:10:39.824 --> 00:10:40.980
Anyway --

00:10:41.004 --> 00:10:42.464
(Laughter)

00:10:42.488 --> 00:10:47.407
(Applause)

00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:49.694
OK. Katrina.

00:10:50.884 --> 00:10:53.908
Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx
and New Orleans' Ninth Ward

00:10:53.932 --> 00:10:55.121
had a lot in common.

00:10:55.145 --> 00:10:57.899
Both were largely populated
by poor people of color,

00:10:57.923 --> 00:11:01.218
both hotbeds of cultural innovation:
think hip-hop and jazz.

00:11:01.242 --> 00:11:04.576
Both are waterfront communities
that host both industries and residents

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.486
in close proximity of one another.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.558
In the post-Katrina era,
we have still more in common.

00:11:09.582 --> 00:11:13.060
We're at best ignored,
and maligned and abused, at worst,

00:11:13.084 --> 00:11:16.431
by negligent regulatory agencies,
pernicious zoning

00:11:16.455 --> 00:11:18.628
and lax governmental accountability.

00:11:18.652 --> 00:11:23.080
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward
nor the South Bronx was inevitable.

00:11:23.104 --> 00:11:25.240
But we have emerged with valuable lessons

00:11:25.264 --> 00:11:27.537
about how to dig ourselves out.

00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:31.363
We are more than simply
national symbols of urban blight

00:11:31.387 --> 00:11:34.693
or problems to be solved
by empty campaign promises

00:11:34.717 --> 00:11:36.327
of presidents come and gone.

00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:39.170
Now will we let the Gulf Coast
languish for a decade or two,

00:11:39.194 --> 00:11:40.456
like the South Bronx did?

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.964
Or will we take proactive steps

00:11:41.988 --> 00:11:44.925
and learn from the homegrown resource
of grassroots activists

00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:47.795
that have been born of desperation
in communities like mine?

00:11:47.819 --> 00:11:50.462
Now listen, I do not expect individuals,

00:11:50.486 --> 00:11:53.271
corporations or government
to make the world a better place

00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:55.119
because it is right or moral.

00:11:55.596 --> 00:11:59.876
This presentation today only represents
some of what I've been through.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.976
Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.096
But I'll tell you later,
if you want to know.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.185
(Laughter)

00:12:05.209 --> 00:12:09.499
But -- I know it's the bottom line,
or one's perception of it,

00:12:09.523 --> 00:12:11.259
that motivates people in the end.

00:12:11.283 --> 00:12:14.205
I'm interested in what I like to call
the "triple bottom line"

00:12:14.229 --> 00:12:16.453
that sustainable development can produce.

00:12:16.477 --> 00:12:20.399
Developments that have the potential
to create positive returns

00:12:20.423 --> 00:12:23.525
for all concerned:
the developers, government

00:12:23.549 --> 00:12:25.985
and the community
where these projects go up.

00:12:26.009 --> 00:12:28.549
At present, that's not happening
in New York City.

00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:32.976
And we are operating with a comprehensive
urban-planning deficit.

00:12:33.358 --> 00:12:35.453
A parade of government subsidies

00:12:35.477 --> 00:12:39.029
is going to propose big-box and stadium
developments in the South Bronx,

00:12:39.053 --> 00:12:42.136
but there is scant coordination
between city agencies

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.910
on how to deal with the cumulative effects
of increased traffic, pollution,

00:12:45.934 --> 00:12:48.459
solid waste and the impacts on open space.

00:12:48.483 --> 00:12:52.863
And their approaches to local economic
and job development are so lame

00:12:52.887 --> 00:12:54.058
it's not even funny.

00:12:54.082 --> 00:12:56.281
Because on top of that,

00:12:56.305 --> 00:13:00.728
the world's richest sports team
is replacing the House That Ruth Built

00:13:00.752 --> 00:13:03.569
by destroying two
well-loved community parks.

00:13:03.593 --> 00:13:06.704
Now, we'll have even less
than that stat I told you about earlier.

00:13:06.728 --> 00:13:10.046
And although less than 25 percent
of South Bronx residents own cars,

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.744
these projects include
thousands of new parking spaces,

00:13:13.768 --> 00:13:17.022
yet zip in terms of mass public transit.

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:19.078
Now, what's missing from the larger debate

00:13:19.102 --> 00:13:21.031
is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis

00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:24.454
between not fixing an unhealthy,
environmentally-challenged community,

00:13:24.478 --> 00:13:28.085
versus incorporating structural,
sustainable changes.

00:13:28.109 --> 00:13:31.340
My agency is working closely
with Columbia University and others

00:13:31.364 --> 00:13:32.950
to shine a light on these issues.

00:13:32.974 --> 00:13:36.173
Now let's get this straight:
I am not anti-development.

00:13:36.197 --> 00:13:38.605
Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve.

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:41.668
And I've embraced my inner capitalist.

00:13:41.692 --> 00:13:43.169
And, but I don't have --

00:13:43.193 --> 00:13:44.818
(Laughter)

00:13:44.842 --> 00:13:47.438
You probably all have,
and if you haven't, you need to.

00:13:47.462 --> 00:13:51.232
(Laughter)

00:13:51.256 --> 00:13:54.672
So I don't have a problem
with developers making money.

00:13:54.696 --> 00:13:57.646
There's enough precedent out there
to show that a sustainable,

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:02.061
community-friendly development
can still make a fortune.

00:14:02.085 --> 00:14:05.157
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough
and Amory Lovins --

00:14:05.181 --> 00:14:09.150
both heroes of mine by the way --
have shown that you can actually do that.

00:14:09.174 --> 00:14:11.976
I do have a problem
with developments that hyper-exploit

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.167
politically vulnerable
communities for profit.

00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:17.039
That it continues is a shame upon us all,

00:14:17.063 --> 00:14:20.004
because we are all responsible
for the future that we create.

00:14:20.028 --> 00:14:23.275
But one of the things I do
to remind myself of greater possibilities,

00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:25.433
is to learn from visionaries
in other cities.

00:14:25.457 --> 00:14:27.489
This is my version of globalization.

00:14:27.513 --> 00:14:29.046
Let's take Bogota.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.863
Poor, Latino, surrounded by
runaway gun violence and drug trafficking;

00:14:32.887 --> 00:14:35.725
a reputation not unlike
that of the South Bronx.

00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:38.976
However, this city was blessed
in the late 1990s

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.024
with a highly-influential
mayor named Enrique Peñalosa.

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:44.829
He looked at the demographics.

00:14:44.853 --> 00:14:46.584
Few Bogotanos own cars,

00:14:46.608 --> 00:14:50.646
yet a huge portion of the city's resources
was dedicated to serving them.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.055
If you're a mayor, you can
do something about that.

00:14:53.079 --> 00:14:57.335
His administration narrowed key municipal
thoroughfares from five lanes to three,

00:14:57.359 --> 00:14:59.622
outlawed parking on those streets,

00:14:59.646 --> 00:15:02.425
expanded pedestrian walkways
and bike lanes,

00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:04.380
created public plazas,

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:07.271
created one of the most efficient
bus mass-transit systems

00:15:07.295 --> 00:15:08.777
in the entire world.

00:15:08.801 --> 00:15:12.575
For his brilliant efforts,
he was nearly impeached.

00:15:13.186 --> 00:15:16.892
But as people began to see
that they were being put first

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.126
on issues reflecting
their day-to-day lives,

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.481
incredible things happened.

00:15:20.505 --> 00:15:21.897
People stopped littering.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:25.806
Crime rates dropped, because the streets
were alive with people.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.709
His administration attacked several
typical urban problems at one time,

00:15:29.733 --> 00:15:31.844
and on a third-world budget, at that.

00:15:31.868 --> 00:15:34.567
We have no excuse
in this country, I'm sorry.

00:15:34.591 --> 00:15:37.432
But the bottom line is:
their people-first agenda

00:15:37.456 --> 00:15:41.370
was not meant to penalize
those who could actually afford cars,

00:15:41.394 --> 00:15:45.259
but rather, to provide opportunities
for all Bogotanos to participate

00:15:45.283 --> 00:15:46.905
in the city's resurgence.

00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:49.089
That development should not come

00:15:49.113 --> 00:15:51.700
at the expense of the majority
of the population

00:15:51.724 --> 00:15:54.494
is still considered
a radical idea here in the U.S.

00:15:54.518 --> 00:15:56.976
But Bogota's example
has the power to change that.

00:15:57.327 --> 00:16:00.820
You, however, are blessed
with the gift of influence.

00:16:00.844 --> 00:16:04.566
That's why you're here and why you
value the information we exchange.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.940
Use your influence

00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:09.264
in support of comprehensive,
sustainable change everywhere.

00:16:09.567 --> 00:16:11.262
Don't just talk about it at TED.

00:16:11.985 --> 00:16:16.095
This is a nationwide policy agenda
I'm trying to build,

00:16:16.119 --> 00:16:18.722
and as you all know,
politics are personal.

00:16:19.118 --> 00:16:21.092
Help me make green the new black.

00:16:21.592 --> 00:16:23.729
Help me make sustainability sexy.

00:16:23.753 --> 00:16:27.150
Make it a part of your dinner
and cocktail conversations.

00:16:27.174 --> 00:16:30.277
Help me fight for environmental
and economic justice.

00:16:30.301 --> 00:16:32.976
Support investments
with a triple-bottom-line return.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.540
Help me democratize sustainability
by bringing everyone to the table,

00:16:37.564 --> 00:16:40.913
and insisting that comprehensive
planning can be addressed everywhere.

00:16:40.937 --> 00:16:42.845
Oh good, glad I have a little more time!

00:16:42.869 --> 00:16:46.814
Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore
the other day after breakfast,

00:16:46.838 --> 00:16:51.586
I asked him how environmental justice
activists were going to be included

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.836
in his new marketing strategy.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.168
His response was a grant program.

00:16:57.692 --> 00:17:01.434
I don't think he understood
that I wasn't asking for funding.

00:17:03.736 --> 00:17:05.508
I was making him an offer.

00:17:07.233 --> 00:17:13.745
(Applause)

00:17:14.983 --> 00:17:19.347
What troubled me was that this
top-down approach is still around.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.150
Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.

00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:23.586
(Laughter)

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:27.717
But grassroots groups
are needed at the table

00:17:27.741 --> 00:17:30.559
during the decision-making process.

00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:34.627
Of the 90 percent of the energy
that Mr. Gore reminded us

00:17:34.651 --> 00:17:36.073
that we waste every day,

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:39.267
don't add wasting our energy, intelligence

00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:43.134
and hard-earned experience to that count.

00:17:43.158 --> 00:17:48.621
(Applause)

00:17:48.645 --> 00:17:55.113
I have come from so far
to meet you like this.

00:17:56.436 --> 00:17:58.811
Please don't waste me.

00:18:00.628 --> 00:18:01.782
By working together,

00:18:01.806 --> 00:18:06.784
we can become one of those small,
rapidly-growing groups of individuals

00:18:06.808 --> 00:18:09.015
who actually have the audacity and courage

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:11.670
to believe that we actually
can change the world.

00:18:12.238 --> 00:18:14.008
We might have come to this conference

00:18:14.032 --> 00:18:16.564
from very, very different
stations in life,

00:18:16.588 --> 00:18:21.188
but believe me, we all share
one incredibly powerful thing.

00:18:23.517 --> 00:18:27.047
We have nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

00:18:28.675 --> 00:18:29.851
Ciao, bellos!

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:36.343
(Applause)
