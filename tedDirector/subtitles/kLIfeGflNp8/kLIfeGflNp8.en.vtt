00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.256
There are times when I feel
really quite ashamed

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.520
to be a European.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.055
In the last year,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.656
more than a million people
arrived in Europe in need of our help,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.960
and our response,
frankly, has been pathetic.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.320
There are just so many contradictions.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.816
We mourn the tragic death

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.000
of two-year-old Alan Kurdi,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.856
and yet, since then,
more than 200 children

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.240
have subsequently drowned
in the Mediterranean.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.416
We have international treaties

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.656
that recognize that refugees
are a shared responsibility,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.736
and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.400
hosts more Syrians
than the whole of Europe combined.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.720
We lament the existence
of human smugglers,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.776
and yet we make that the only viable route

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.880
to seek asylum in Europe.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.696
We have labor shortages,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.176
and yet we exclude people who fit
our economic and demographic needs

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.040
from coming to Europe.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.936
We proclaim our liberal values
in opposition to fundamentalist Islam,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.160
and yet --

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.216
we have repressive policies

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.560
that detain child asylum seekers,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.960
that separate children
from their families,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.720
and that seize property from refugees.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.200
What are we doing?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.056
How has the situation come to this,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.880
that we've adopted such an inhumane
response to a humanitarian crisis?

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.696
I don't believe
it's because people don't care,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.896
or at least I don't want to believe
it's because people don't care.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.736
I believe it's because
our politicians lack a vision,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.376
a vision for how to adapt
an international refugee system

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.536
created over 50 years ago

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.360
for a changing and globalized world.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.336
And so what I want to do
is take a step back

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.776
and ask two really fundamental questions,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.256
the two questions we all need to ask.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.576
First, why is the current
system not working?

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.000
And second, what can we do to fix it?

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.816
So the modern refugee regime

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.920
was created in the aftermath
of the Second World War by these guys.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.136
Its basic aim is to ensure

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.376
that when a state fails,
or worse, turns against its own people,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.976
people have somewhere to go,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.656
to live in safety and dignity
until they can go home.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.960
It was created precisely for situations
like the situation we see in Syria today.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.536
Through an international convention
signed by 147 governments,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.576
the 1951 Convention
on the Status of Refugees,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.776
and an international organization, UNHCR,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.576
states committed to reciprocally
admit people onto their territory

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.120
who flee conflict and persecution.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.280
But today, that system is failing.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.360
In theory, refugees
have a right to seek asylum.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.840
In practice, our immigration policies
block the path to safety.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.616
In theory, refugees have a right
to a pathway to integration,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.680
or return to the country
they've come from.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.600
But in practice, they get stuck
in almost indefinite limbo.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.320
In theory, refugees
are a shared global responsibility.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.376
In practice, geography means
that countries proximate the conflict

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.000
take the overwhelming majority
of the world's refugees.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.456
The system isn't broken
because the rules are wrong.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.400
It's that we're not applying them
adequately to a changing world,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.840
and that's what we need to reconsider.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.936
So I want to explain to you a little bit
about how the current system works.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.120
How does the refugee regime actually work?

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.336
But not from a top-down
institutional perspective,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.680
rather from the perspective of a refugee.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.696
So imagine a Syrian woman.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.320
Let's call her Amira.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.760
And Amira to me represents
many of the people I've met in the region.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.896
Amira, like around 25 percent
of the world's refugees,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.200
is a woman with children,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.096
and she can't go home
because she comes from this city

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.136
that you see before you, Homs,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.896
a once beautiful and historic city

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.416
now under rubble.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.280
And so Amira can't go back there.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.336
But Amira also has no hope
of resettlement to a third country,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.856
because that's a lottery ticket

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.320
only available to less than one percent
of the world's refugees.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.136
So Amira and her family

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.336
face an almost impossible choice.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.760
They have three basic options.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.520
The first option is that Amira
can take her family to a camp.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.680
In the camp, she might get assistance,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.856
but there are very few prospects
for Amira and her family.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.136
Camps are in bleak, arid locations,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.400
often in the desert.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.736
In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.160
you can hear the shells
across the border in Syria at nighttime.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.176
There's restricted economic activity.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.360
Education is often of poor quality.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.296
And around the world,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.416
some 80 percent of refugees
who are in camps

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.976
have to stay for at least five years.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.896
It's a miserable existence,

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.296
and that's probably why, in reality,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.920
only nine percent of Syrians
choose that option.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.976
Alternatively, Amira can head
to an urban area

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.040
in a neighboring country,
like Amman or Beirut.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.040
That's an option that about 75 percent
of Syrian refugees have taken.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.920
But there, there's
great difficulty as well.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.016
Refugees in such urban areas
don't usually have the right to work.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.000
They don't usually get
significant access to assistance.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.136
And so when Amira and her family
have used up their basic savings,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.840
they're left with very little
and likely to face urban destitution.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.120
So there's a third alternative,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.640
and it's one that increasing
numbers of Syrians are taking.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.016
Amira can seek some hope for her family

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.776
by risking their lives
on a dangerous and perilous journey

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.296
to another country,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.840
and it's that which we're seeing
in Europe today.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.696
Around the world, we present refugees
with an almost impossible choice

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.536
between three options:

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.760
encampment, urban destitution
and dangerous journeys.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.840
For refugees, that choice is
the global refugee regime today.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.240
But I think it's a false choice.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.840
I think we can reconsider that choice.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.800
The reason why we limit those options

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.520
is because we think

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.456
that those are the only options
that are available to refugees,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.680
and they're not.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.616
Politicians frame the issue
as a zero-sum issue,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.576
that if we benefit refugees,
we're imposing costs on citizens.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.656
We tend to have a collective assumption

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.336
that refugees are an inevitable cost
or burden to society.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.440
But they don't have to.
They can contribute.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.296
So what I want to argue

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.296
is there are ways in which we can
expand that choice set

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.336
and still benefit everyone else:

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.216
the host states and communities,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.560
our societies and refugees themselves.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.056
And I want to suggest four ways

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.920
we can transform the paradigm
of how we think about refugees.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.960
All four ways have one thing in common:

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.216
they're all ways in which we take
the opportunities of globalization,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.296
mobility and markets,

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.560
and update the way we think
about the refugee issue.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.976
The first one I want to think about

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
is the idea of enabling environments,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.576
and it starts from
a very basic recognition

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.296
that refugees are human beings
like everyone else,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.720
but they're just
in extraordinary circumstances.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.256
Together with my colleagues in Oxford,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.936
we've embarked on
a research project in Uganda

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.000
looking at the economic lives of refugees.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.896
We chose Uganda not because
it's representative of all host countries.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.400
It's not. It's exceptional.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.336
Unlike most host countries
around the world,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.816
what Uganda has done

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.216
is give refugees economic opportunity.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.600
It gives them the right to work.
It gives them freedom of movement.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.096
And the results of that are extraordinary

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.720
both for refugees and the host community.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.456
In the capital city, Kampala,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.895
we found that 21 percent of refugees
own a business that employs other people,

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:52.376
and 40 percent of those employees

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.376
are nationals of the host country.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.576
In other words, refugees are making jobs

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.240
for citizens of the host country.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.256
Even in the camps,
we found extraordinary examples

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.840
of vibrant, flourishing
and entrepreneurial businesses.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.136
For example, in a settlement
called Nakivale,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.136
we found examples of Congolese refugees

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.696
running digital music exchange businesses.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.496
We found a Rwandan
who runs a business that's available

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.256
to allow the youth to play computer games

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.040
on recycled games consoles
and recycled televisions.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.256
Against the odds of extreme constraint,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.600
refugees are innovating,

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.749
and the gentleman you see before you
is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.856
Demou-Kay arrived
in the settlement with very little,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.176
but he wanted to be a filmmaker.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.136
So with friends and colleagues,
he started a community radio station,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.896
he rented a video camera,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.416
and he's now making films.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.416
He made two documentary films

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.416
with and for our team,

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.760
and he's making a successful business
out of very little.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.616
It's those kinds of examples

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.376
that should guide
our response to refugees.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.736
Rather than seeing refugees

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.016
as inevitably dependent
upon humanitarian assistance,

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.440
we need to provide them
with opportunities for human flourishing.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.426
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food

00:10:16.438 --> 00:10:19.216
are all important in the emergency phase,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.840
but we need to also look beyond that.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.536
We need to provide opportunities
to connectivity, electricity,

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.840
education, the right to work,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.120
access to capital and banking.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.696
All the ways in which we take for granted

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.856
that we are plugged in
to the global economy

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.440
can and should apply to refugees.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.760
The second idea I want to discuss
is economic zones.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.056
Unfortunately, not every
host country in the world

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.120
takes the approach Uganda has taken.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.816
Most host countries don't open up
their economies to refugees

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.040
in the same way.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.960
But there are still pragmatic
alternative options that we can use.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.696
Last April, I traveled to Jordan
with my colleague,

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.680
the development economist Paul Collier,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.256
and we brainstormed an idea
while we were there

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.736
with the international community
and the government,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.096
an idea to bring jobs to Syrians

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.736
while supporting Jordan's
national development strategy.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.560
The idea is for an economic zone,

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.616
one in which we could potentially
integrate the employment of refugees

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.120
alongside the employment
of Jordanian host nationals.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.256
And just 15 minutes away
from the Zaatari refugee camp,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.416
home to 83,000 refugees,

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.456
is an existing economic zone

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.200
called the King Hussein
Bin Talal Development Area.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.696
The government has spent
over a hundred million dollars

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.536
connecting it to the electricity grid,
connecting it to the road network,

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.176
but it lacked two things:

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.936
access to labor and inward investment.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.856
So what if refugees
were able to work there

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.696
rather than being stuck in camps,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.736
able to support their families and develop
skills through vocational training

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.200
before they go back to Syria?

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.136
We recognized that
that could benefit Jordan,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.936
whose development strategy
requires it to make the leap

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.776
as a middle income country
to manufacturing.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.496
It could benefit refugees,
but it could also contribute

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.896
to the postconflict
reconstruction of Syria

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.696
by recognizing that we need
to incubate refugees

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.280
as the best source
of eventually rebuilding Syria.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.816
We published the idea
in the journal Foreign Affairs.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.056
King Abdullah has picked up on the idea.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.056
It was announced at the London
Syria Conference two weeks ago,

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.680
and a pilot will begin in the summer.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.720
(Applause)

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.816
The third idea that I want to put to you

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.456
is preference matching
between states and refugees

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.616
to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes
you see here in the selfie

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.520
featuring Angela Merkel
and a Syrian refugee.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.440
What we rarely do is ask refugees
what they want, where they want to go,

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.816
but I'd argue we can do that

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.920
and still make everyone better off.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.776
The economist Alvin Roth has developed
the idea of matching markets,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:09.040
ways in which the preference ranking
of the parties shapes an eventual match.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.776
My colleagues Will Jones
and Alex Teytelboym

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.936
have explored ways in which that idea
could be applied to refugees,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.496
to ask refugees to rank
their preferred destinations,

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.296
but also allow states to rank
the types of refugees they want

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.136
on skills criteria or language criteria

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.856
and allow those to match.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.976
Now, of course
you'd need to build in quotas

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.256
on things like diversity
and vulnerability,

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.816
but it's a way of increasing
the possibilities of matching.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.336
The matching idea
has been successfully used

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.496
to match, for instance,
students with university places,

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.016
to match kidney donors with patients,

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.176
and it underlies the kind of algorithms
that exist on dating websites.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.296
So why not apply that
to give refugees greater choice?

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.368
It could also be used
at the national level,

00:13:57.392 --> 00:13:59.376
where one of the great challenges we face

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.136
is to persuade local communities
to accept refugees.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.616
And at the moment,
in my country, for instance,

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.816
we often send engineers to rural areas
and farmers to the cities,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.696
which makes no sense at all.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.296
So matching markets offer a potential way
to bring those preferences together

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.256
and listen to the needs and demands
of the populations that host

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.120
and the refugees themselves.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.560
The fourth idea I want to put to you
is of humanitarian visas.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.936
Much of the tragedy and chaos
we've seen in Europe

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.960
was entirely avoidable.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.496
It stems from a fundamental contradiction
in Europe's asylum policy,

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.896
which is the following:

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.416
that in order to seek asylum in Europe,

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.456
you have to arrive spontaneously
by embarking on those dangerous journeys

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.680
that I described.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.256
But why should those journeys be necessary
in an era of the budget airline

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.696
and modern consular capabilities?

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.056
They're completely unnecessary journeys,

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.856
and last year, they led to the deaths
of over 3,000 people

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.360
on Europe's borders
and within European territory.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.976
If refugees were simply allowed

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.776
to travel directly
and seek asylum in Europe,

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.096
we would avoid that,

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.656
and there's a way of doing that

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.976
through something
called a humanitarian visa,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.536
that allows people
to collect a visa at an embassy

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.696
or a consulate in a neighboring country

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.616
and then simply pay their own way

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.200
through a ferry or a flight to Europe.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.976
It costs around a thousand euros

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.416
to take a smuggler
from Turkey to the Greek islands.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.896
It costs 200 euros to take a budget
airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.696
If we allowed refugees to do that,
it would have major advantages.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.000
It would save lives,

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.696
it would undercut
the entire market for smugglers,

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.056
and it would remove the chaos
we see from Europe's front line

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.136
in areas like the Greek islands.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.400
It's politics that prevents us doing that
rather than a rational solution.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.216
And this is an idea that has been applied.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.896
Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.216
where over 2,000 Syrians
have been able to get humanitarian visas,

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.616
enter Brazil, and claim refugee status
on arrival in Brazil.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.536
And in that scheme,
every Syrian who has gone through it

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.520
has received refugee status
and been recognized as a genuine refugee.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.400
There is a historical precedent
for it as well.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.256
Between 1922 and 1942,

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.056
these Nansen passports
were used as travel documents

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.616
to allow 450,000 Assyrians,
Turks and Chechens

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.136
to travel across Europe

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.920
and claim refugee status
elsewhere in Europe.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.256
And the Nansen
International Refugee Office

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.136
received the Nobel Peace Prize

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.120
in recognition of this
being a viable strategy.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.216
So all four of these ideas
that I've presented you

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.560
are ways in which we can expand
Amira's choice set.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.176
They're ways in which we can have
greater choice for refugees

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.016
beyond those basic,
impossible three options

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.256
I explained to you

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.360
and still leave others better off.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.336
In conclusion,
we really need a new vision,

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.136
a vision that enlarges
the choices of refugees

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.696
but recognizes that they
don't have to be a burden.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.175
There's nothing inevitable
about refugees being a cost.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.455
Yes, they are a humanitarian
responsibility,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.096
but they're human beings
with skills, talents, aspirations,

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.800
with the ability to make
contributions -- if we let them.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.760
In the new world,

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:32.576
migration is not going to go away.

00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:35.576
What we've seen in Europe
will be with us for many years.

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:37.415
People will continue to travel,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.296
they'll continue to be displaced,

00:17:39.319 --> 00:17:42.816
and we need to find rational,
realistic ways of managing this --

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.856
not based on the old logics
of humanitarian assistance,

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.976
not based on logics of charity,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.616
but building on the opportunities

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.016
offered by globalization,
markets and mobility.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.456
I'd urge you all to wake up
and urge our politicians

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.336
to wake up to this challenge.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.616
Thank you very much.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:08.524
(Applause)
