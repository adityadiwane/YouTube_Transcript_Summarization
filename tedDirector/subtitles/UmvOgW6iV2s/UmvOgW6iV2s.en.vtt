00:00:12.743 --> 00:00:15.605
We always hear that texting is a scourge.

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:20.445
The idea is that texting spells the decline and fall

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:23.945
of any kind of serious literacy, or at least writing ability,

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:26.588
among young people in the United States

00:00:26.588 --> 00:00:28.889
and now the whole world today.

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:32.393
The fact of the matter is that it just isn't true,

00:00:32.393 --> 00:00:34.896
and it's easy to think that it is true,

00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:36.795
but in order to see it in another way,

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:40.464
in order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing,

00:00:40.464 --> 00:00:43.029
not just energetic, but a miraculous thing,

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:44.776
a kind of emergent complexity

00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:47.237
that we're seeing happening right now,

00:00:47.237 --> 00:00:49.543
we have to pull the camera back for a bit

00:00:49.543 --> 00:00:52.961
and look at what language really is,

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:55.034
in which case, one thing that we see

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:59.658
is that texting is not writing at all.

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:01.480
What do I mean by that?

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.036
Basically, if we think about language,

00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:07.837
language has existed for perhaps 150,000 years,

00:01:07.837 --> 00:01:09.974
at least 80,000 years,

00:01:09.974 --> 00:01:14.125
and what it arose as is speech. People talked.

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:17.149
That's what we're probably genetically specified for.

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.340
That's how we use language most.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.822
Writing is something that came along much later,

00:01:22.822 --> 00:01:24.878
and as we saw in the last talk,

00:01:24.878 --> 00:01:27.546
there's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened,

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:29.862
but according to traditional estimates,

00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:33.384
if humanity had existed for 24 hours,

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:38.575
then writing only came along at about 11:07 p.m.

00:01:38.575 --> 00:01:42.220
That's how much of a latterly thing writing is.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.608
So first there's speech, and then writing comes along

00:01:45.608 --> 00:01:47.370
as a kind of artifice.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.376
Now don't get me wrong, writing has certain advantages.

00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:53.959
When you write, because it's a conscious process,

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.097
because you can look backwards,

00:01:56.097 --> 00:01:58.927
you can do things with language that are much less likely

00:01:58.927 --> 00:02:01.391
if you're just talking.

00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:05.292
For example, imagine a passage from Edward Gibbon's

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:09.098
"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:"

00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:12.349
"The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours,

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.651
till the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed

00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:17.424
into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example

00:02:17.424 --> 00:02:20.011
was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself."

00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:24.330
That's beautiful, but let's face it, nobody talks that way.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.566
Or at least, they shouldn't if they're interested

00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:31.080
in reproducing. That --

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.799
(Laughter)

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.777
is not the way any human being speaks casually.

00:02:36.777 --> 00:02:39.362
Casual speech is something quite different.

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:41.218
Linguists have actually shown

00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:43.929
that when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way,

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.607
we tend to speak in word packets of maybe

00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:48.417
seven to 10 words.

00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:51.096
You'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:54.089
yourself or a group of people talking.

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:55.544
That's what speech is like.

00:02:55.544 --> 00:02:59.849
Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.539
It's much less reflective -- very different from writing.

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.475
So we naturally tend to think, because we see language

00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:08.917
written so often, that that's what language is,

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:12.885
but actually what language is, is speech. They are two things.

00:03:12.885 --> 00:03:16.139
Now of course, as history has gone by,

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.930
it's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.944
between speech and writing.

00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:26.767
So, for example, in a distant era now,

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:29.269
it was common when one gave a speech

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.386
to basically talk like writing.

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:34.736
So I mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving

00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:37.269
in an old movie where they clear their throat, and they go,

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.802
"Ahem, ladies and gentlemen," and then they speak

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:43.073
in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech.

00:03:43.073 --> 00:03:46.932
It's formal. It uses long sentences like this Gibbon one.

00:03:46.932 --> 00:03:50.894
It's basically talking like you write, and so, for example,

00:03:50.894 --> 00:03:52.889
we're thinking so much these days about Lincoln

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.100
because of the movie.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.183
The Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event.

00:03:58.183 --> 00:04:02.098
For two hours before that, Edward Everett spoke

00:04:02.098 --> 00:04:05.338
on a topic that, frankly, cannot engage us today

00:04:05.338 --> 00:04:06.835
and barely did then.

00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:09.216
The point of it was to listen to him

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:10.772
speaking like writing.

00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:13.120
Ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.553
It was perfectly natural.

00:04:14.553 --> 00:04:17.044
That's what people did then, speaking like writing.

00:04:17.044 --> 00:04:19.510
Well, if you can speak like writing,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.308
then logically it follows that you might want to also

00:04:23.308 --> 00:04:26.174
sometimes write like you speak.

00:04:26.174 --> 00:04:28.224
The problem was just that in the material,

00:04:28.224 --> 00:04:31.679
mechanical sense, that was harder back in the day

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:34.986
for the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it.

00:04:34.986 --> 00:04:37.006
It's almost impossible to do that with your hand

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:40.441
except in shorthand, and then communication is limited.

00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:42.957
On a manual typewriter it was very difficult,

00:04:42.957 --> 00:04:45.244
and even when we had electric typewriters,

00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:47.403
or then computer keyboards, the fact is

00:04:47.403 --> 00:04:49.702
that even if you can type easily enough to keep up

00:04:49.702 --> 00:04:52.495
with the pace of speech, more or less, you have to have

00:04:52.495 --> 00:04:54.840
somebody who can receive your message quickly.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.051
Once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message,

00:04:58.051 --> 00:05:00.655
then you have the conditions that allow

00:05:00.655 --> 00:05:04.166
that we can write like we speak.

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:07.384
And that's where texting comes in.

00:05:07.384 --> 00:05:11.153
And so, texting is very loose in its structure.

00:05:11.153 --> 00:05:15.450
No one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts,

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.808
but then again, do you think about those things when you talk?

00:05:17.808 --> 00:05:21.481
No, and so therefore why would you when you were texting?

00:05:21.481 --> 00:05:24.610
What texting is, despite the fact that it involves

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.436
the brute mechanics of something that we call writing,

00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:30.734
is fingered speech. That's what texting is.

00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:34.199
Now we can write the way we talk.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.978
And it's a very interesting thing, but nevertheless

00:05:36.978 --> 00:05:41.834
easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline.

00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:45.118
We see this general bagginess of the structure,

00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:48.467
the lack of concern with rules and the way that we're used to

00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:50.739
learning on the blackboard, and so we think

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:53.978
that something has gone wrong.

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:56.941
It's a very natural sense.

00:05:56.941 --> 00:06:00.975
But the fact of the matter is that what is going on

00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:04.546
is a kind of emergent complexity.

00:06:04.546 --> 00:06:07.302
That's what we're seeing in this fingered speech.

00:06:07.302 --> 00:06:10.288
And in order to understand it, what we want to see

00:06:10.288 --> 00:06:15.033
is the way, in this new kind of language,

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:18.609
there is new structure coming up.

00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:24.332
And so, for example, there is in texting a convention,

00:06:24.332 --> 00:06:27.254
which is LOL.

00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:29.998
Now LOL, we generally think of

00:06:29.998 --> 00:06:32.462
as meaning "laughing out loud."

00:06:32.462 --> 00:06:34.755
And of course, theoretically, it does,

00:06:34.755 --> 00:06:37.184
and if you look at older texts, then people used it

00:06:37.184 --> 00:06:39.704
to actually indicate laughing out loud.

00:06:39.704 --> 00:06:43.947
But if you text now, or if you are someone who

00:06:43.947 --> 00:06:47.244
is aware of the substrate of texting the way it's become,

00:06:47.244 --> 00:06:48.934
you'll notice that LOL

00:06:48.934 --> 00:06:51.004
does not mean laughing out loud anymore.

00:06:51.004 --> 00:06:54.794
It's evolved into something that is much subtler.

00:06:54.794 --> 00:06:58.241
This is an actual text that was done

00:06:58.241 --> 00:07:02.173
by a non-male person of about 20 years old

00:07:02.173 --> 00:07:03.668
not too long ago.

00:07:03.668 --> 00:07:06.620
"I love the font you're using, btw."

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.382
Julie: "lol thanks gmail is being slow right now"

00:07:10.382 --> 00:07:12.124
Now if you think about it, that's not funny.

00:07:12.124 --> 00:07:15.024
No one's laughing. (Laughter)

00:07:15.024 --> 00:07:16.994
And yet, there it is, so you assume

00:07:16.994 --> 00:07:18.351
there's been some kind of hiccup.

00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:20.185
Then Susan says "lol, I know,"

00:07:20.185 --> 00:07:22.482
again more guffawing than we're used to

00:07:22.482 --> 00:07:25.712
when you're talking about these inconveniences.

00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.456
So Julie says, "I just sent you an email."

00:07:28.456 --> 00:07:30.007
Susan: "lol, I see it."

00:07:30.007 --> 00:07:33.625
Very funny people, if that's what LOL means.

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:35.753
This Julie says, "So what's up?"

00:07:35.753 --> 00:07:38.395
Susan: "lol, I have to write a 10 page paper."

00:07:38.395 --> 00:07:40.709
She's not amused. Let's think about it.

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:43.390
LOL is being used in a very particular way.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.081
It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation.

00:07:47.081 --> 00:07:50.330
We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.169
Any spoken language that's used by real people has them.

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:55.945
If you happen to speak Japanese, think about

00:07:55.945 --> 00:07:59.303
that little word "ne" that you use at the end of a lot of sentences.

00:07:59.303 --> 00:08:01.648
If you listen to the way black youth today speak,

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.434
think about the use of the word "yo."

00:08:03.434 --> 00:08:05.380
Whole dissertations could be written about it,

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.654
and probably are being written about it.

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:11.448
A pragmatic particle, that's what LOL has gradually become.

00:08:11.448 --> 00:08:15.497
It's a way of using the language between actual people.

00:08:15.497 --> 00:08:18.736
Another example is "slash."

00:08:18.736 --> 00:08:21.504
Now, we can use slash in the way that we're used to,

00:08:21.504 --> 00:08:23.144
along the lines of, "We're going to have

00:08:23.144 --> 00:08:26.626
a party-slash-networking session."

00:08:26.626 --> 00:08:28.720
That's kind of like what we're at.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.259
Slash is used in a very different way

00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:35.217
in texting among young people today.

00:08:35.217 --> 00:08:37.070
It's used to change the scene.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.019
So for example, this Sally person says,

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.824
"So I need to find people to chill with"

00:08:41.824 --> 00:08:43.343
and Jake says, "Haha" --

00:08:43.343 --> 00:08:46.231
you could write a dissertation about "Haha" too, but we don't have time for that —

00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:48.720
"Haha so you're going by yourself? Why?"

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.330
Sally: "For this summer program at NYU."

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.224
Jake: "Haha. Slash I'm watching this video with suns players

00:08:54.224 --> 00:08:56.021
trying to shoot with one eye."

00:08:56.021 --> 00:08:57.296
The slash is interesting.

00:08:57.296 --> 00:09:00.452
I don't really even know what Jake is talking about after that,

00:09:00.452 --> 00:09:05.193
but you notice that he's changing the topic.

00:09:05.193 --> 00:09:07.011
Now that seems kind of mundane,

00:09:07.011 --> 00:09:08.453
but think about how in real life,

00:09:08.453 --> 00:09:11.111
if we're having a conversation and we want to change the topic,

00:09:11.111 --> 00:09:12.723
there are ways of doing it gracefully.

00:09:12.723 --> 00:09:14.442
You don't just zip right into it.

00:09:14.442 --> 00:09:18.637
You'll pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance,

00:09:18.637 --> 00:09:22.747
or you'll say something like, "Hmm, makes you think --"

00:09:22.747 --> 00:09:25.107
when it really didn't, but what you're really --

00:09:25.107 --> 00:09:27.342
(Laughter) —

00:09:27.342 --> 00:09:30.050
what you're really trying to do is change the topic.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.977
You can't do that while you're texting,

00:09:31.977 --> 00:09:35.708
and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.960
All spoken languages have what a linguist calls

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.353
a new information marker -- or two, or three.

00:09:41.353 --> 00:09:45.647
Texting has developed one from this slash.

00:09:45.647 --> 00:09:48.632
So we have a whole battery of new constructions

00:09:48.632 --> 00:09:51.219
that are developing, and yet it's easy to think,

00:09:51.219 --> 00:09:53.666
well, something is still wrong.

00:09:53.666 --> 00:09:57.441
There's a lack of structure of some sort.

00:09:57.441 --> 00:09:59.347
It's not as sophisticated

00:09:59.347 --> 00:10:01.553
as the language of The Wall Street Journal.

00:10:01.553 --> 00:10:03.327
Well, the fact of the matter is,

00:10:03.327 --> 00:10:05.778
look at this person in 1956,

00:10:05.778 --> 00:10:08.060
and this is when texting doesn't exist,

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.895
"I Love Lucy" is still on the air.

00:10:09.895 --> 00:10:13.658
"Many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table,

00:10:13.658 --> 00:10:14.995
cannot write grammatically -- "

00:10:14.995 --> 00:10:17.204
We've heard that sort of thing before,

00:10:17.204 --> 00:10:21.195
not just in 1956. 1917, Connecticut schoolteacher.

00:10:21.195 --> 00:10:23.896
1917. This is the time when we all assume

00:10:23.896 --> 00:10:27.147
that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect

00:10:27.147 --> 00:10:29.565
because the people on "Downton Abbey" are articulate,

00:10:29.565 --> 00:10:30.776
or something like that.

00:10:30.776 --> 00:10:33.720
So, "From every college in the country goes up the cry,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.353
'Our freshmen can't spell, can't punctuate.'"

00:10:36.353 --> 00:10:38.761
And so on. You can go even further back than this.

00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:41.945
It's the President of Harvard. It's 1871.

00:10:41.945 --> 00:10:44.487
There's no electricity. People have three names.

00:10:44.487 --> 00:10:46.912
"Bad spelling,

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:50.180
incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing."

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.329
And he's talking about people who are otherwise

00:10:52.329 --> 00:10:54.220
well prepared for college studies.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.066
You can go even further back.

00:10:56.066 --> 00:10:59.919
1841, some long-lost superintendent of schools is upset

00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:03.096
because of what he has for a long time "noted with regret

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:06.605
the almost entire neglect of the original" blah blah blah blah blah.

00:11:06.605 --> 00:11:11.893
Or you can go all the way back to 63 A.D. -- (Laughter) --

00:11:11.893 --> 00:11:14.274
and there's this poor man who doesn't like the way

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:15.495
people are speaking Latin.

00:11:15.495 --> 00:11:18.651
As it happens, he was writing about what had become French.

00:11:18.651 --> 00:11:25.053
And so, there are always — (Laughter) (Applause) —

00:11:25.053 --> 00:11:27.224
there are always people worrying about these things

00:11:27.224 --> 00:11:30.497
and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning.

00:11:30.497 --> 00:11:35.144
And so, the way I'm thinking of texting these days is

00:11:35.144 --> 00:11:38.724
that what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing

00:11:38.724 --> 00:11:40.350
that young people are developing,

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.110
which they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills,

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.277
and that means that they're able to do two things.

00:11:47.277 --> 00:11:50.174
Increasing evidence is that being bilingual

00:11:50.174 --> 00:11:52.407
is cognitively beneficial.

00:11:52.407 --> 00:11:54.562
That's also true of being bidialectal.

00:11:54.562 --> 00:11:57.652
That's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing.

00:11:57.652 --> 00:12:02.570
And so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.872
that young people are using today, not consciously, of course,

00:12:05.872 --> 00:12:09.559
but it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire.

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:10.788
It's very simple.

00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:14.498
If somebody from 1973 looked at

00:12:14.498 --> 00:12:18.604
what was on a dormitory message board in 1993,

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.437
the slang would have changed a little bit

00:12:20.437 --> 00:12:22.255
since the era of "Love Story,"

00:12:22.255 --> 00:12:25.568
but they would understand what was on that message board.

00:12:25.568 --> 00:12:28.292
Take that person from 1993 -- not that long ago,

00:12:28.292 --> 00:12:31.550
this is "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" -- those people.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.919
Take those people and they read

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:36.819
a very typical text written by a 20-year-old today.

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:39.710
Often they would have no idea what half of it meant

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.638
because a whole new language has developed

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.932
among our young people doing something as mundane

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.203
as what it looks like to us when they're batting around

00:12:48.203 --> 00:12:49.878
on their little devices.

00:12:49.878 --> 00:12:53.539
So in closing, if I could go into the future,

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:57.914
if I could go into 2033,

00:12:57.914 --> 00:13:00.827
the first thing I would ask is whether David Simon

00:13:00.827 --> 00:13:04.720
had done a sequel to "The Wire." I would want to know.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.703
And — I really would ask that —

00:13:07.703 --> 00:13:10.793
and then I'd want to know actually what was going on on "Downton Abbey."

00:13:10.793 --> 00:13:12.302
That'd be the second thing.

00:13:12.302 --> 00:13:14.838
And then the third thing would be,

00:13:14.838 --> 00:13:18.029
please show me a sheaf of texts

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:19.986
written by 16-year-old girls,

00:13:19.986 --> 00:13:22.440
because I would want to know where this language

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.395
had developed since our times,

00:13:24.395 --> 00:13:28.028
and ideally I would then send them back to you and me now

00:13:28.028 --> 00:13:30.548
so we could examine this linguistic miracle

00:13:30.548 --> 00:13:32.898
happening right under our noses.

00:13:32.898 --> 00:13:34.414
Thank you very much.

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:39.582
(Applause)

00:13:39.582 --> 00:13:43.189
Thank you. (Applause)
