00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.096
Welcome to Bayeku,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.496
a riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos --

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.896
a vivid representation of several
riverine communities across Nigeria,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.896
communities whose waterways
have been infested

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.776
by an invasive aquatic weed;

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.056
communities where economic livelihoods
have been hampered:

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.296
fishing, marine transportation

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.576
and trading;

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.776
communities where fish yields
have diminished;

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.416
communities where schoolchildren
are unable to go to school

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.736
for days, sometimes weeks, on end.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.616
Who would have thought that this plant

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.376
with round leaves, inflated stems,
and showy, lavender flowers

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.176
would cause such havoc
in these communities.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.976
The plant is known as water hyacinth

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.296
and its botanical name,
Eichhornia crassipes.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.856
Interestingly, in Nigeria,
the plant is also known by other names,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.736
names associated with historical events,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.656
as well as myths.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.776
In some places,
the plant is called Babangida.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.936
When you hear Babangida, you remember
the military and military coups.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.296
And you think: fear, restraint.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.696
In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta,
the plant is also known as Abiola.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.136
When you hear Abiola,
you remember annulled elections

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.776
and you think: dashed hopes.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.336
In the southwestern part of Nigeria,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.576
the plant is known as Gbe'borun.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.376
Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.376
which translates to "gossip,"
or "talebearer."

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.216
When you think of gossip, you think:
rapid reproduction, destruction.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.776
And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.656
the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.376
And when you hear that,
you think of death.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.256
It literally translates
to "death to mother and child."

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.136
I personally had my encounter
with this plant in the year 2009.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.896
It was shortly after I had relocated
from the US to Nigeria.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.456
I'd quit my job in corporate America

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.656
and decided to take
this big leap of faith,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.176
a leap of faith that came
out of a deep sense of conviction

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.336
that there was a lot of work
to do in Nigeria

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.816
in the area of sustainable development.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.816
And so here I was in the year 2009,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.976
actually, at the end of 2009,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.016
in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.696
And I looked to my left
and saw this very arresting image.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.496
It was an image of fishing boats

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.256
that had been hemmed in
by dense mats of water hyacinth.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.656
And I was really pained by what I saw

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.176
because I thought to myself,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.056
"These poor fisherfolk,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.936
how are they going
to go about their daily activities

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.056
with these restrictions."

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.136
And then I thought,
"There's got to be a better way."

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.176
A win-win solution whereby
the environment is taken care of

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.576
by the weeds being cleared out of the way

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.736
and then this being turned
into an economic benefit

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.576
for the communities
whose lives are impacted the most

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.360
by the infestation of the weed.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.736
That, I would say, was my spark moment.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.216
And so I did further research
to find out more

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.176
about the beneficial uses of this weed.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.616
Out of the several,
one struck me the most.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.736
It was the use of the plant
for handicrafts.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.096
And I thought, "What a great idea."

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.496
Personally, I love handicrafts,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.176
especially handicrafts
that are woven around a story.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.816
And so I thought, "This could be
easily deployed within the communities

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.376
without the requirement
of technical skills."

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.040
And I thought to myself,
"Three simple steps to a mega solution."

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.136
First step: Get out into the waterways
and harvest the water hyacinth.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.456
That way, you create access.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.056
Secondly, you dry
the water hyacinth stems.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.495
And thirdly, you weave
the water hyacinth into products.

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:34.896
The third step was a challenge.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.616
See, I'm a computer scientist
by background

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.296
and not someone in the creative arts.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.016
And so I began my quest

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.976
to find out how I can learn how to weave.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.136
And this quest took me
to a community in Ibadan, where I lived,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.576
called Sabo.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.456
Sabo translates to "strangers' quarters."

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.496
And the community is
predominantly made up of people

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.496
from the northern part of the country.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.456
So I literally took
my dried weeds in hand,

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.056
there were several more of them,

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.416
and went knocking from door to door
to find out who could teach me

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.856
how to weave these
water hyacinth stems into ropes.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.000
And I was directed
to the shed of Malam Yahaya.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.896
The problem, though,
is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.016
and neither did I speak Hausa.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.176
But some little kids came to the rescue

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.976
and helped translate.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.256
And that began my journey
of learning how to weave

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.856
and transform these
dried water hyacinth stems

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.760
into long ropes.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.656
With my long ropes in hand,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.776
I was now equipped to make products.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.216
And that was the beginning
of partnerships.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.216
Working with rattan basket makers
to come up with products.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.016
So with this in hand, I felt confident

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.040
that I would be able
to take this knowledge

00:05:52.064 --> 00:05:54.616
back into the riverine communities

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.896
and help them to transform
their adversity into prosperity.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.096
So taking these weeds
and actually weaving them

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.696
into products that can be sold.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.456
So we have pens, we have tableware,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.256
we have purses, we have tissue boxes.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.816
Thereby, helping the communities

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.016
to see water hyacinth
in a different light.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.696
Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.856
being aesthetic,
being durable, tough, resilient.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.256
Changing names, changing livelihoods.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.256
From Gbe'borun, gossip,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.096
to Olusotan, storyteller.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.136
And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma,
which is "killer of mother and child,"

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.496
to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.896
"provider of food for mother and child."

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.776
And I'd like to end
with a quote by Michael Margolis.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.816
He said, "If you want to learn
about a culture, listen to the stories.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.896
And if you want to change a culture,
change the stories."

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.016
And so, from Makoko community,
to Abobiri, to Ewoi,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.696
to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.296
we have changed the story.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.856
Thank you for listening.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.000
(Applause)
