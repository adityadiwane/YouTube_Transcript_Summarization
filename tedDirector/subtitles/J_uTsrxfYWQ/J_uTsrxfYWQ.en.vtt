00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
In the last 50 years,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
we've been building the suburbs

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
with a lot of unintended consequences.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
that I think give us tremendous reasons

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
to be really optimistic

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
that the big design and development project of the next 50 years

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
is going to be retrofitting suburbia.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
So whether it's redeveloping dying malls

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
or reconstructing wetlands

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
out of parking lots,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
I think the fact is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
the growing number

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
of empty and under-performing,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
especially retail, sites

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
throughout suburbia

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
gives us actually a tremendous opportunity

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
to take our least-sustainable

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
landscapes right now

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
and convert them into

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
more sustainable places.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And in the process, what that allows us to do

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
is to redirect a lot more of our growth

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
back into existing communities

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
that could use a boost,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
and have the infrastructure in place,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
instead of continuing

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
to tear down trees

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and to tear up the green space out at the edges.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
So why is this important?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
I think there are any number of reasons,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Just from the perspective of climate change,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
the average urban dweller in the U.S.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
has about one-third the carbon footprint

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
of the average suburban dweller,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
and living in detached buildings,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
you have that much more exterior surface

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
to leak energy out of.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
So strictly from

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
a climate change perspective,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
the cities are already

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
relatively green.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
The big opportunity

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
is actually in urbanizing

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
the suburbs.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
It's increased our dependence

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
on foreign oil

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
despite the gains in fuel efficiency.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
We're just driving so much more;

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
we haven't been able to keep up technologically.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Public health is another reason

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
to consider retrofitting.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Researchers at the CDC and other places

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
have increasingly been linking

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
suburban development patterns

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
with sedentary lifestyles.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And those have been linked then

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
with the rather alarming,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
growing rates of obesity,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
shown in these maps here,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
and that obesity has also been triggering

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
great increases in heart disease

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and diabetes

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
to the point where a child born today

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
has a one-in-three chance

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
of developing diabetes.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And that rate has been escalating at the same rate

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
as children not walking

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
to school anymore,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
again, because of our development patterns.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
I mean, how affordable is it

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
to continue to live in suburbia

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
with rising gas prices?

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Suburban expansion to cheap land,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
for the last 50 years --

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
you know the cheap land out on the edge --

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
has helped generations of families

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
enjoy the American dream.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
But increasingly,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
the savings promised

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
by drive-till-you-qualify affordability --

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
which is basically our model --

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
those savings are wiped out

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
when you consider the transportation costs.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
For instance, here in Atlanta,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
about half of households

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and they are spending 29 percent of their income

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
on housing

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and 32 percent

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
on transportation.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
I mean, that's 2005 figures.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
You know, none of us

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
really tend to do the math on our transportation costs,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and they're not going down

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
any time soon.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
or you hate its soulless commercial strips,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
there are reasons why it's important to retrofit.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
But is it practical?

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
I think it is.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
June Williamson and I have been researching this topic

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
for over a decade,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
and we've found over 80

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
varied projects.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
But that they're really all market driven,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
and what's driving the market in particular --

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
number one -- is major demographic shifts.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
We all tend to think of suburbia

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
as this very family-focused place,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
but that's really not the case anymore.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Since 2000,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
already two-thirds of households in suburbia

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
did not have kids in them.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
The reasons for this have a lot to with

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
the dominance of the two big

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
demographic groups right now:

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
the Baby Boomers retiring --

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
and then there's a gap,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Generation X, which is a small generation.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
They're still having kids --

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
but Generation Y hasn't even started

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
hitting child-rearing age.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
They're the other big generation.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
So as a result of that,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
demographers predict

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that through 2025,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
75 to 85 percent of new households

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
will not have kids in them.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And the market research, consumer research,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
asking the Boomers and Gen Y

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
what it is they would like,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
what they would like to live in,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
tells us there is going to be a huge demand --

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and we're already seeing it --

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
for more urban lifestyles

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
within suburbia.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and Gen Y would like to live

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
an urban lifestyle,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
The other big dynamic of change

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
is the sheer performance of

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
underperforming asphalt.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Now I keep thinking this would be a great name

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
for an indie rock band,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
but developers generally use it

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
to refer to underused parking lots --

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and suburbia is full of them.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
When the postwar suburbs were first built

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
out on the cheap land

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
away from downtown,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
it made sense to just build

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
surface parking lots.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
But those sites have now been leapfrogged

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
and leapfrogged again,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
as we've just continued to sprawl,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and they now have

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
a relatively central location.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
It no longer just makes sense.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
It now makes sense to go back in,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
build a deck and build up

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
on those sites.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
So what do you do

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
with a dead mall,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
dead office park?

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
It turns out, all sorts of things.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
In a slow economy like ours,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
re-inhabitation is

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
one of the more popular strategies.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
So this happens to be

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
a dead mall in St. Louis

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
that's been re-inhabited as art-space.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
It's now home to artist studios,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
theater groups, dance troupes.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
It's not pulling in as much tax revenue

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
as it once was,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
but it's serving its community.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
It's keeping the lights on.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
Other malls have been re-inhabited

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
as nursing homes,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
as universities,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
and as all variety of office space.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
We also found a lot of examples

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
of dead big-box stores

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
that have been converted into

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
all sorts of community-serving uses as well --

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
lots of schools, lots of churches

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
and lots of libraries like this one.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
that is now a public library.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
they tore up some of the parking spaces,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
put in a lot more sidewalks

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
to connect to the neighborhoods.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
And they've made this,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
what was just a store along a commercial strip,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
into a community gathering space.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
in Phoenix, Arizona.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
a gourmet grocery,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
Never underestimate the power of food

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
to turn a place around

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
and make it a destination.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
The real estate ads in the neighborhood

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
all very proudly proclaim,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
"Walking distance to Le Grande Orange,"

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
because it provided its neighborhood

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
with what sociologists like to call

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
"a third place."

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
If home is the first place

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
and work is the second place,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
the third place is where you go to hang out

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
and build community.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
And especially as suburbia is becoming

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
less centered on the family,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
the family households,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
there's a real hunger

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
for more third places.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
So the most dramatic retrofits

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
are really those in the next category,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
the next strategy: redevelopment.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
Now, during the boom, there were several

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
really dramatic redevelopment projects

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
where the original building

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
at significantly greater density,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
But some of them have been much more incremental.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
This is Mashpee Commons,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
the oldest retrofit that we've found.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
built urbanism

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
on top of its parking lots.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
So the black and white photo shows

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
the simple 60's strip shopping center.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
And then the maps above that

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
show its gradual transformation

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
into a compact,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
mixed-use New England village,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
and it has plans now that have been approved

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
for it to connect

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
to new residential neighborhoods

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
across the arterials

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
and over to the other side.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
So, you know, sometimes it's incremental.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
Sometimes, it's all at once.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
This is another infill project on the parking lots,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
and opened a station nearby to this site,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
the owners decided

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
to build a new parking deck

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
and then insert on top of their surface lots

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
a new Main Street, several apartments

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
and condo buildings,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
while keeping the existing office buildings.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
Here is the site in 1940:

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
It was just a little farm

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
in the village of Hyattsville.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
By 1980, it had been subdivided

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
into a big mall on one side

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and the office park on the other

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
and then some buffer sites for a library

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
and a church to the far right.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Today, the transit,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
the Main Street and the new housing

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
have all been built.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
Eventually, I expect that the streets

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
Plans have already been announced

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
for a lot of those garden apartments

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
above the mall to be redeveloped.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Transit is a big driver of retrofits.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
So here's what it looks like.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
in between the office buildings

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and the public space and the new Main Street.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
I think they really built an attractive place here

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
and have just employed all-green construction.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
as well as wind turbines.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
This was a very large mall

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
on a hundred-acre superblock.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
It's now 22

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
walkable urban blocks

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
with public streets,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
two public parks, eight bus lines

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
and a range of housing types,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
and so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
the downtown

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
that this particular suburb never had.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Here was the mall in its heyday.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
So here's the site in 1975

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
with the mall.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
By 1995, the mall has died.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
The department store has been kept --

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
and we found this was true in many cases.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
The department stores are multistory; they're better built.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
They're easy to be re-adapted.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
But the one story stuff ...

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
that's really history.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
So here it is at projected build-out.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
This project, I think, has great connectivity

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
to the existing neighborhoods.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
It's providing 1,500 households with the option

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
of a more urban lifestyle.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
It's about two-thirds built out right now.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Here's what the new Main Street looks like.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
It's very successful,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
and it's helped to prompt --

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
eight of the 13

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
regional malls in Denver

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
have now, or have announced plans to

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
be, retrofitted.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
is not occurring --

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
No, it's pockets of walkability

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
on the sites of

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
under-performing properties.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
And so it's giving people more choices,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
but it's not taking away choices.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
But it's also not really enough

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
to just create pockets of walkability.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
So this is one that has been

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
retrofitted in California.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
They took the commercial strip

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
shown on the black-and-white images below,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and they built a boulevard

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
that has become the Main Street for their town.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
And it's transformed from being

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
an ugly, unsafe,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
undesirable address,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
to becoming a beautiful,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
attractive, dignified sort of good address.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
I mean now we're hoping we start to see it;

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
without tearing down another tree.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
So there's a lot of great things,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
But densification

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
is not going to work everywhere.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Sometimes re-greening

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
is really the better answer.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
There's a lot to learn from successful

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
landbanking programs

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
in cities like Flint, Michigan.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement --

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
sort of victory gardens meets the Internet.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
is the opportunity to restore

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
the local ecology,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
as in this example outside of Minneapolis.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
When the shopping center died,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
the city restored the site's

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
original wetlands,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
creating lakefront property,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
which then attracted private investment,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
in over 40 years.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
So they've managed to both restore the local ecology

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
and the local economy at the same time.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
This is another re-greening example.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
It also makes sense in very strong markets.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
This one in Seattle

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
is on the site of a mall parking lot

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
adjacent to a new transit stop.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
And the wavy line

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
But daylighting our creeks

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
really improves their water quality

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
and contributions to habitat.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
So I've shown you some of

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
the first generation of retrofits.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
What's next?

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
I think we have three challenges for the future.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
The first is to plan retrofitting

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
much more systemically

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
at the metropolitan scale.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
We need to be able to target

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
which areas really should be re-greened.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
Where should we be redeveloping?

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation?

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
These slides just show two images

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
from a larger project

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
I led a team that was asked to imagine

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
Atlanta 100 years from now.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
And we chose to try to reverse sprawl

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
through three simple moves -- expensive, but simple.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
One, in a hundred years,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
transit on all major

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
rail and road corridors.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
Two, in a hundred years,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
thousand foot buffers

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
on all stream corridors.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
It's a little extreme, but we've got a little water problem.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
In a hundred years,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
subdivisions that simply end up too close to water

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
or too far from transit won't be viable.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
And so we've created the eco-acre

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
transfer-to-transfer development rights

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
to the transit corridors

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
and allow the re-greening

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
of those former subdivisions

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
for food and energy production.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
So the second challenge

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
is to improve the architectural design quality

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
of the retrofits.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
And I close with this image

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
of democracy in action:

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
This is a protest that's happening

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
on a retrofit in Silver Spring, Maryland

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
on an Astroturf town green.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
Now, retrofits are often accused

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
of being examples of faux downtowns

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.260
and instant urbanism,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
and not without reason; you don't get much more phony

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.260
than an Astroturf town green.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
I have to say, these are very hybrid places.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
They are new but trying to look old.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
They have urban streetscapes,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
but suburban parking ratios.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
Their populations are

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
more diverse than typical suburbia,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
but they're less diverse than cities.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
And they are

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
public places,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
but that are managed by private companies.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260
And just the surface appearance

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.260
are often -- like the Astroturf here --

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
they make me wince.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
So, you know, I mean I'm glad that

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
the urbanism is doing its job.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
The fact that a protest is happening

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
really does mean

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
that the layout of the blocks, the streets and blocks, the putting in of public space,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
compromised as it may be,

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.260
is still a really great thing.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.260
But we've got to get the architecture better.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.260
The final challenge is for all of you.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.260
I want you to join the protest

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.260
and start demanding

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
more sustainable suburban places --

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
more sustainable places, period.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
But culturally,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
we tend to think that downtowns

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
should be dynamic, and we expect that.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
But we seem to have an expectation

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
that the suburbs should forever remain frozen

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
in whatever adolescent form

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.260
they were first given birth to.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.260
It's time to let them grow up,

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.260
so I want you

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.260
to all support the zoning changes,

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.260
the road diets, the infrastructure improvements

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.260
and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.260
Thank you.
