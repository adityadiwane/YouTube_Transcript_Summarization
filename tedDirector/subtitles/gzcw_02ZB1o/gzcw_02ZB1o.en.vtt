00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm going to talk today about saving more,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
but not today, tomorrow.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
It's a program that Richard Thaler

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
from the University of Chicago and I

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
devised maybe 15 years ago.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
The program, in a sense,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
is an example of behavioral finance

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
on steroids --

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
how we could really use behavioral finance.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Now you might ask, what is behavioral finance?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
So let's think about how we manage our money.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Let's start with mortgages.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
It's kind of a recent topic,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
at least in the U.S.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
A lot of people buy

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
the biggest house they can afford,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
and actually slightly bigger than that.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And then they foreclose.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And then they blame the banks

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Let's also think about

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
how we manage risks --

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
for example, investing in the stock market.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Two years ago, three years ago, about four years ago,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
markets did well.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
We were risk takers, of course.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Then market stocks seize

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and we're like, "Wow.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
These losses, they feel, emotionally,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
they feel very different

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
from what we actually thought about it

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
when markets were going up."

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
So we're probably not doing a great job

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
when it comes to risk taking.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
How many of you have iPhones?

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Anyone? Wonderful.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
I would bet many more of you

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
insure your iPhone --

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
you're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
What if you lose your iPhone?

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
What if you do this?

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
How many of you have kids?

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Anyone?

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Keep your hands up

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
if you have sufficient life insurance.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
I see a lot of hands coming down.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
I would predict,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
if you're a representative sample,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
that many more of you

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
insure your iPhones than your lives,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
even when you have kids.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
We're not doing that well when it comes to insurance.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.260
The average American household

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
spends 1,000 dollars a year

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
on lotteries.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
And I know it sounds crazy.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
How many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries?

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
No one.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
So that tells us that the people not in this room

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
are spending more than a thousand

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
to get the average to a thousand.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Low-income people

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.260
spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
So where does it take us?

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
We're not doing a great job managing money.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Behavioral finance is really a combination

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
of psychology and economics,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
trying to understand

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
the money mistakes people make.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And I can keep standing here

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.260
for the 12 minutes and 53 seconds that I have left

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
and make fun of all sorts of ways

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
we manage money,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and at the end you're going to ask, "How can we help people?"

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
And that's what I really want to focus on today.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
How do we take an understanding

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
of the money mistakes people make,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
and then turning the behavioral challenges

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
into behavioral solutions?

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And what I'm going to talk about today

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
is Save More Tomorrow.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
I want to address the issue

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
of savings.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
We have on the screen

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
a representative sample

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
of 100 Americans.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And we're going to look at their saving behavior.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
First thing to notice is,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
half of them

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
do not even have access

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
to a 401(k) plan.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
They cannot make savings easy.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
They cannot have money go away from their paycheck

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
into a 401(k) plan

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
before they see it,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
before they can touch it.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
What about the remaining half of the people?

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Some of them elect not to save.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
They're just too lazy.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
They never get around to logging into a complicated website

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
and doing 17 clicks to join the 401(k) plan.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And then they have to decide how they're going to invest

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
in their 52 choices,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and they never heard about what is a money market fund.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.260
How many people end up saving to a 401(k) plan?

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
One third of Americans.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Two thirds are not saving now.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Are they saving enough?

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
Take out those

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
who say they save too little.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
One out of 10

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
are saving enough.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Nine out of 10

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
either cannot save through their 401(k) plan,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
decide not to save -- or don't decide --

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
or save too little.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
We think we have a problem

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
of people saving too much.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Let's look at that.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
We have one person --

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
well, actually we're going to slice him in half

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
because it's less than one percent.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Roughly half a percent of Americans

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.260
feel that they save too much.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
What are we going to do about it?

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
That's what I really want to focus on.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
We have to understand

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
why people are not saving,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
and then we can hopefully flip

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
the behavioral challenges

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
into behavioral solutions,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and then see how powerful it might be.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
So let me divert for a second

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
as we're going to identify the problems,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
the challenges, the behavioral challenges,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
that prevent people from saving.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.260
I'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
And during the break

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
there would be a snack

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and you could choose bananas or chocolate.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
How many of you think you would like to have bananas

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
during this hypothetical TED event next week?

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Who would go for bananas?

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
Wonderful.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
I predict scientifically

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
74 percent of you will go for bananas.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Well that's at least what one wonderful study predicted.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And then count down the days

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.260
and see what people ended up eating.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
The same people that imagined themselves

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
eating the bananas

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
ended up eating chocolates

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
a week later.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
Self-control

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
is not a problem in the future.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
It's only a problem now

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.260
when the chocolate is next to us.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
What does it have to do with time and savings,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
this issue of immediate gratification?

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Or as some economists call it, present bias.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
We think about saving. We know we should be saving.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
We know we'll do it next year, but today let us go and spend.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Christmas is coming,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.260
So this issue of present bias

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
causes us to think about saving,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
but end up spending.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Let me now talk

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
about another behavioral obstacle to saving

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
having to do with inertia.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
But again, a little diversion

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
to the topic of organ donation.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Wonderful study comparing different countries.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
We're going to look at two similar countries,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
Germany and Austria.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
And in Germany,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
if you would like to donate your organs --

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
God forbid something really bad

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
happens to you --

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
when you get your driving license or an I.D.,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
you check the box saying,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
"I would like to donate my organs."

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
Not many people like checking boxes.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
It takes effort. You need to think.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
Twelve percent do.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Austria, a neighboring country,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
slightly similar, slightly different.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
What's the difference?

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Well, you still have choice.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
You will decide

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
whether you want to donate your organs or not.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
But when you get your driving license,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
you check the box

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.260
if you do not want to donate your organ.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
Nobody checks boxes.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
That's kind of too much effort.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
One percent check the box. The rest do nothing.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
Doing nothing is very common.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
Not many people check boxes.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
What are the implications

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
to saving lives

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
and having organs available?

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
In Germany, 12 percent check the box.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
Twelve percent are organ donors.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
Huge shortage of organs,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
God forbid, if you need one.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
In Austria, again, nobody checks the box.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Therefore, 99 percent of people

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
are organ donors.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
Inertia, lack of action.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
What is the default setting

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
if people do nothing,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
if they keep procrastinating, if they don't check the boxes?

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Very powerful.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
We're going to talk

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.260
about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
to make their 401(k) choices.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
Are we going to make them automatically join the plan,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
or are they going to be left out?

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
In too many 401(k) plans,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
if people do nothing,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
it means they're not saving for retirement,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
if they don't check the box.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And checking the box takes effort.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
So we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
One more before we flip the challenges into solutions,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
having to do with monkeys and apples.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
No, no, no, this is a real study

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.260
and it's got a lot to do with behavioral economics.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
One group of monkeys gets an apple, they're pretty happy.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
The other group gets two apples, one is taken away.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
They still have an apple left.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
They're really mad.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Why have you taken our apple?

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
This is the notion of loss aversion.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
We hate losing stuff,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
even if it doesn't mean a lot of risk.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
You would hate to go to the ATM,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
take out 100 dollars

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
and notice that you lost one of those $20 bills.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
It's very painful,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
even though it doesn't mean anything.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.260
Those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.260
So this notion of loss aversion

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
kicks in when it comes to savings too,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
because people, mentally

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
and emotionally and intuitively

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
frame savings as a loss

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
because I have to cut my spending.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
So we talked about

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
all sorts of behavioral challenges

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.260
having to do with savings eventually.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Whether you think about immediate gratification,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
and the chocolates versus bananas,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
it's just painful to save now.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
It's a lot more fun

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
to spend now.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
We talked about inertia and organ donations

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
and checking the box.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
If people have to check a lot of boxes

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
to join a 401(k) plan,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
they're going to keep procrastinating

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
and not join.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
And last, we talked about loss aversion,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
and the monkeys and the apples.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
If people frame mentally

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
saving for retirement as a loss,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
they're not going to be saving for retirement.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
So we've got these challenges,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
and what Richard Thaler and I

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
were always fascinated by --

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
take behavioral finance,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
make it behavioral finance on steroids

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
or behavioral finance 2.0

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
or behavioral finance in action --

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.260
flip the challenges into solutions.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
And we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.260
called Save More, not today, Tomorrow.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
How is it going to solve the challenges

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
we chatted about?

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
If you think about the problem

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
of bananas versus chocolates,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
we think we're going to eat bananas next week.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
We think we're going to save more next year.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Save More Tomorrow

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
invites employees

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
to save more maybe next year --

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
sometime in the future

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
when we can imagine ourselves

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
eating bananas,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
volunteering more in the community,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.260
exercising more and doing all the right things on the planet.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Now we also talked about checking the box

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
and the difficulty of taking action.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
Save More Tomorrow

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
makes it easy.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
It's an autopilot.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Once you tell me you would like to save more in the future,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
let's say every January

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
you're going to be saving more automatically

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
and it's going to go away from your paycheck to the 401(k) plan

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
before you see it, before you touch it,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
before you get the issue

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
of immediate gratification.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
But what are we going to do about the monkeys

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
and loss aversion?

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
Next January comes

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
and people might feel that if they save more,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
they have to spend less, and that's painful.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Well, maybe it shouldn't be just January.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
Maybe we should make people save more

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
when they make more money.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
That way, when they make more money, when they get a pay raise,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.260
they don't have to cut their spending.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
They take a little bit

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
of the increase in the paycheck home

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
and spend more --

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
take a little bit of the increase

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
and put it in a 401(k) plan.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
So that is the program,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
embarrassingly simple,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
but as we're going to see,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
extremely powerful.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
We first implemented it,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
Richard Thaler and I,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
back in 1998.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
Mid-sized company in the Midwest,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
blue collar employees

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
struggling to pay their bills

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
repeatedly told us

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
they cannot save more right away.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
Saving more today is not an option.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
We invited them to save

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
three percentage points more

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
every time they get a pay raise.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
And here are the results.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
We're seeing here a three and a half-year period,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
four pay raises,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
people who were struggling to save,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
were saving three percent of their paycheck,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
three and a half years later

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
saving almost four times as much,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
almost 14 percent.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
And there's shoes and bicycles

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and things on this chart

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
because I don't want to just throw numbers

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
in a vacuum.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
I want, really, to think about the fact

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
that saving four times more

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
is a huge difference

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
in terms of the lifestyle

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
that people will be able to afford.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
It's real.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
It's not just numbers on a piece of paper.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
Whereas with saving three percent,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
people might have to add nice sneakers

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
so they can walk,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.260
because they won't be able to afford anything else,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
when they save 14 percent

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
to walk to the car to drive.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
This is a real difference.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:31.260
By now, about 60 percent of the large companies

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
actually have programs like this in place.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
It's been part of the Pension Protection Act.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
And needless to say that Thaler and I

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
have been blessed to be part of this program

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
and make a difference.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Let me wrap

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
with two key messages.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
One is behavioral finance

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
is extremely powerful.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
This is just one example.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Message two

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
is there's still a lot to do.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
This is really the tip of the iceberg.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
If you think about people and mortgages

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
we need to think about that.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
If you're thinking about people taking too much risk

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
and not understanding how much risk they're taking

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
or taking too little risk,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
we need to think about that.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
If you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
on lottery tickets,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
we need to think about that.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
The average actually,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
the record is in Singapore.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
The average household

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
spends $4,000 a year on lottery tickets.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
We've got a lot to do,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
a lot to solve,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
also in the retirement area

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
when it comes to what people do with their money

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
after retirement.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
One last question:

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
How many of you feel comfortable

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
that as you're planning for retirement

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
you have a really solid plan

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
when you're going to retire,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
when you're going to claim Social Security benefits,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
what lifestyle to expect,

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
how much to spend every month

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
so you're not going to run out of money?

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
How many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.260
when it comes to post-retirement decisions.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
One, two, three, four.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
Less than three percent

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
of a very sophisticated audience.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
Behavioral finance has a long way.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
There's a lot of opportunities

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.260
to make it powerful again and again and again.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
Thank you.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
(Applause)
