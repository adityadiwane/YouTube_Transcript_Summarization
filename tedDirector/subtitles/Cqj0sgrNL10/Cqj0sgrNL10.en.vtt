00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
The stories we tell about each other

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
matter very much.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And most of all,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I think the way that we participate in each other's stories

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
is of deep importance.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
I was six years old

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
when I first heard stories about the poor.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I heard them from my Sunday school teacher

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
and Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
I remember learning that people who were poor

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
needed something material --

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
food, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And I also was taught, coupled with that,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children --

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
it was our job, apparently, to help.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
This is what Jesus asked of us.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And then he said, "What you do for the least of these, you do for me."

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Now I was pretty psyched.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
I was very eager to be useful in the world --

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
I think we all have that feeling.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
That was news to me,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
But I also learned very soon thereafter

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
that Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
the poor would always be with us.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
This frustrated and confused me;

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
that I had to do, and I was excited to do,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
but no matter what I would do, I would fail.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
So I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
like maybe I'd misunderstood something here.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And I felt overwhelmed.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
And for the first time,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
I began to fear this group of people

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
that were never going away, that would always be with us.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
which I was excited to do,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
but I didn't know how it was going to work.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
especially if the problem was never going away.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
In the years following,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
the other stories I heard about the poor growing up

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
were no more positive.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
For example, I saw pictures and images

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
frequently of sadness and suffering.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
I heard about disease, I heard about war --

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
they always seemed to be kind of related.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
And in general,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
I got this sort of idea

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
that the poor in the world lived lives

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
that were wrought with suffering and sadness,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
devastation, hopelessness.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
And after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
is this predictable response,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And so naturally,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
I started to distance myself.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I stopped listening to their stories

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
quite as closely as I had before.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And I stopped expecting things to really change.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Now I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
I gave of my time and my money,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
I gave when solutions were on sale.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
I mean who can argue with that?

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
that I gave to relieve my own suffering,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
not someone else's.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
The truth be told, I was giving out of that place,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
not out of a genuine place of hope

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and excitement to help and of generosity.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
It became a transaction for me,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
became sort of a trade.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
I was purchasing something --

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
I was buying my right to go on with my day

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And I think the way that we go through that sometimes

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
can, first of all,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And it can also turn into a commodity,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
which is a very scary thing.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
So as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
we kind of buy our distance,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
we kind of buy our right to go on with our day.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
It can get in the way of our desire

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and, in short to love.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
but to give the shorthand version

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
for any who have not heard him speak,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
for his work pioneering modern microfinance.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
When I heard him speak, it was three years before that.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well --

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
think of that as financial services for the poor.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Think of all the things you get at your bank

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
and imagine those products and services

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Dr. Yunus shared his story,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
explaining what that was,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
He also talked about, in particular, microlending,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
which is a tiny loan

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
that could help someone start or grow a business.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
First and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
that, for once, showed me, maybe,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
a way to interact with someone

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and didn't make me feel bad --

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
that was exciting.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
But more importantly, he told stories about the poor

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
that were different than any stories I had heard before.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.260
In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
He was talking about strong, smart,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
was a little bit of capital.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
It was an amazing sort of insight for me.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this --

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
it's hard to express now how much that affected me --

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
and I moved to East Africa

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
to try to see for myself what this was about.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
For the first time, actually, in a long time

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
I wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and see for myself what their lives were actually about.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
So I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
to start or grow a business.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
And in fact, through those interactions,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
for the first time, I was starting to get to be friends

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
that was supposed to be far away.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
And over and over again,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
as I interviewed them and spent my days with them,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
I did hear stories of life change

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and amazing little details of change.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
So I would hear from goat herders

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Their business trajectory would change.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
They would make a little bit more money;

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
their standard of living

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
would shift and would get better.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
like they would start to send their children to school.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
They might be able to buy mosquito nets.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and offer that to me when I came as their guest

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
and that made them feel proud.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
But there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and some days that's what happened --

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
these beautiful details of life change

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
that were meaningful to them.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
That was another thing that really touched me.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
It was really humbling to see for the first time,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
to really understand

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
I probably would have gotten a lot wrong.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
Because the best way for people to change their lives

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
So I saw that and it was very humbling.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
I never once was asked for a donation,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
which had kind of been my mode, right.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
There's poverty, you give money to help --

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
no one asked me for a donation.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
and to build on their own capabilities.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
So what I did hear, once in a while,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
was that people wanted a loan --

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
I just got this impression that the money would work.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
And my introduction to business

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
was in these $100 little infuses of capital.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
So this idea

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
that these new stories of business and hope

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
might be shared with my friends and family,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
to be able to continue their businesses as loans,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
that's this little idea that turned into Kiva.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
A few months later, I went back to Uganda

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
with a digital camera and a basic website

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
that my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
and took pictures of seven of my new friends,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.260
posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
spammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
but do you say, do you want to help participate in this,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
provide the money that they need?"

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
The money came in basically overnight.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
We sent it over to Uganda.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
the entrepreneurs received the money,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
and they were able to support themselves

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and change the trajectory of their lives.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
In October of '05,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
after those first seven loans were paid,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Matt and I took the word beta off of the site.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
We said, "Our little experiment has been a success.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Let's start for real." That was our official launch.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
And then that first year, October '05 through '06,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
The second year, it was a total of 15 million.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
The third year, the total was up to around 40.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
The fourth year, we were just short of 100.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
And today, less than five years in,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Kiva's facilitated

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
more than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
from lenders and entrepreneurs --

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
And while those numbers and those statistics

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
are really fun to talk about and they're interesting,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
to me, Kiva's really about stories.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
It's about retelling

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
the story of the poor,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
and it's about giving ourselves

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
an opportunity to engage

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
that validates their dignity,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
validates a partnership relationship,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
not a relationship that's based

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
weirdness that can happen.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
But instead a relationship that can promote respect

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and hope

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and this optimism

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
that together we can move forward.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
So what I hope is that,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva --

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
that's a very positive and meaningful thing --

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
but I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
between the traditional rich and poor categories

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
that we're taught to see in the world,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
Because as that happens,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
I think we can feel free to interact

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
in a way that's more open, more just and more creative,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
to engage with each other and to help each other.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Imagine how you feel

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
when you see somebody on street who is begging

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
and you're about to approach them.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
Imagine how you feel;

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
who wants to tell you about their business.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Maybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
Imagine if you're speaking with somebody

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
who's growing things and making them flourish,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
somebody who's using their talents

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
to do something productive,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
somebody who's built their own business from scratch,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
someone who is surrounded by abundance,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
not scarcity,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
who's in fact creating abundance,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
somebody with full hands with something to offer,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
not empty hands

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
asking for you to give them something.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
of somebody who wakes up every day

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
and works very, very hard to make their life better.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
These stories can really change the way that we think about each other.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
And if we can catalyze

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
a supportive community to come around these individuals

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
and to participate in their story

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
by lending a little bit of money,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
I think that can change the way we believe in each other

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
and each other's potential.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
And as I look forward to what is next,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
have taught me what entrepreneurship is.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
You see an opportunity

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
and going after that.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
So they're not a donation.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
But in fact, when you give something to someone

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
and they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
that's one thing.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
This continued attention -- this ongoing attention --

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
is a really big deal

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
to build different kinds of relationships among us.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
when all else is equal,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
given the option to have just money to do what you need to do,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
or money plus the support and encouragement

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
of a global community,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
people choose the community plus the money.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
So with that in mind, this particular incident

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
has led to the things that I'm working on now.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
And one thing that I've seen

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
With social networks,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
it's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
in our own supportive communities, rapidly.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
And so, as I have been thinking about this,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
I've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and to catalyze all of us

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
to make tomorrow better than today?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
As I've researched what's going on in the United States,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
a few interesting little insights have come up.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
So one is that, of course, as we all might expect,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
or they might need money during a hard month.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
But there's always a need for resources close by.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
Another thing is, it turns out,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect --

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
banks, venture capitalists,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
other organizations and support structures --

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
they come from friends and family.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
comes from friends and family.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
That's around 130 billion dollars a year --

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
it's a lot.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
And third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
it's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
how to ask, what to promise in return,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
even though they have the best of intentions

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
and want to thank those people that are supporting them.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
exactly what that financial exchange should look like,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
exactly what fits them and the people around them,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
this week actually,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
through investments from their friends and family.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
And it's investments, not donations, not loans,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
but investments that have a dynamic return.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
So the mapping of participating in the story,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
it actually flows with the up and down.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
So in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
for small businesses to raise these funds.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
create investment terms in a really easy way.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
We make it really, really simple for me

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
as well as anyone else who wants to use the site.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
They can raise up to a million dollars

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
from an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors --

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
everyday people, heaven forbid --

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
and they can share those returns over time --

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
again, whatever terms they set.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
As investors choose to become involved

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
based on those terms,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
they can either take their rewards back as cash,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
or they can decide in advance

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
to give those returns away to a non-profit.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
a path to go do what they want to do in the world

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
and to gather the people around them that they already have,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
the people that know them best

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
and that love them and want to support them,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
to gather them to make this happen.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
So that's what I'm working on now.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
just like they've cared enough to use Kiva

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
to make those connections.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care --

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
I'm not even going to try.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
I don't think, even though we often hear,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
the religious reasons,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
"Here's why caring and giving will make you happier."

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know;

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
in fact, I think we know so much,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
and it's such a reality

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
that we care so deeply,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
that in fact, what usually stops us

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
is that we're afraid to try and to mess up,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
because we care so very much about helping each other

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
and being meaningful in each other's lives.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
So what I think I can do today,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
that best thing I can give you --

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
I've given you my story, which is the best I can do.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
And I think I can remind us that we do care.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
I think we all already know that.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
And I think we know that love is resilient enough

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
for us to get out there and try.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
Just a sec.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
(Applause)

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
Thanks.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:05.260
(Applause)

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
Thanks.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
(Applause)

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
For me, the best way to be inspired to try

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
is to stop and to listen

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
to someone else's story.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
And I'm grateful that whenever I do that,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
guaranteed, I am inspired --

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
I am inspired by the person I am listening to.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
And I believe more and more every time I listen

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
in that that person's potential to do great things in the world

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
and in my own potential to maybe help.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
And that --

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
forget the tools, forget the moving around of resources --

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
that stuff's easy.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
Believing in each other,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
really being sure when push comes to shove

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
that each one of us can do amazing things in the world,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
that is what can make our stories into love stories

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
and our collective story

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
into one that continually perpetuates hope

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
and good things for all of us.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
So that, this belief in each other,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
knowing that without a doubt

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
and practicing that every day in whatever you do,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
Thank you.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:26.260
(Applause)
