00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:14.940
Approximately 30 years ago,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.633
when I was in oncology at the Children's Hospital

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:19.022
in Philadelphia,

00:00:19.022 --> 00:00:22.176
a father and a son walked into my office

00:00:22.176 --> 00:00:25.320
and they both had their right eye missing,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.131
and as I took the history, it became apparent

00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:30.900
that the father and the son had a rare form

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.442
of inherited eye tumor, retinoblastoma,

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:37.556
and the father knew that he had passed that fate

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:39.431
on to his son.

00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:41.843
That moment changed my life.

00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:43.747
It propelled me to go on

00:00:43.747 --> 00:00:47.279
and to co-lead a team that discovered

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:50.476
the first cancer susceptibility gene,

00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:53.197
and in the intervening decades since then,

00:00:53.197 --> 00:00:56.617
there has been literally a seismic shift

00:00:56.617 --> 00:00:58.643
in our understanding of what goes on,

00:00:58.643 --> 00:01:01.531
what genetic variations are sitting behind

00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:03.090
various diseases.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.474
In fact, for thousands of human traits,

00:01:06.474 --> 00:01:08.692
a molecular basis that's known for that,

00:01:08.692 --> 00:01:11.987
and for thousands of people, every day,

00:01:11.987 --> 00:01:14.068
there's information that they gain

00:01:14.068 --> 00:01:16.510
about the risk of going on to get this disease

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.736
or that disease.

00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:21.041
At the same time, if you ask,

00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:23.748
"Has that impacted the efficiency,

00:01:23.748 --> 00:01:25.840
how we've been able to develop drugs?"

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.622
the answer is not really.

00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:29.952
If you look at the cost of developing drugs,

00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:33.341
how that's done, it basically hasn't budged that.

00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:37.814
And so it's as if we have the power to diagnose

00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:40.626
yet not the power to fully treat.

00:01:40.626 --> 00:01:43.092
And there are two commonly given reasons

00:01:43.092 --> 00:01:44.560
for why that happens.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.032
One of them is it's early days.

00:01:48.032 --> 00:01:51.622
We're just learning the words, the fragments,

00:01:51.622 --> 00:01:53.398
the letters in the genetic code.

00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:55.553
We don't know how to read the sentences.

00:01:55.553 --> 00:01:58.123
We don't know how to follow the narrative.

00:01:58.123 --> 00:02:00.602
The other reason given is that

00:02:00.602 --> 00:02:02.820
most of those changes are a loss of function,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.745
and it's actually really hard to develop drugs

00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:07.660
that restore function.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.842
But today, I want us to step back

00:02:09.842 --> 00:02:11.870
and ask a more fundamental question,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.059
and ask, "What happens if we're thinking

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.792
about this maybe in the wrong context?"

00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:19.951
We do a lot of studying of those who are sick

00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:22.551
and building up long lists

00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:25.669
of altered components.

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.068
But maybe, if what we're trying to do

00:02:28.068 --> 00:02:31.290
is to develop therapies for prevention,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.843
maybe what we should be doing

00:02:32.843 --> 00:02:35.225
is studying those who don't get sick.

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:37.572
Maybe we should be studying those

00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:39.747
that are well.

00:02:39.747 --> 00:02:41.544
A vast majority of those people

00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:43.880
are not necessarily carrying a particular

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.816
genetic load or risk factor.

00:02:45.816 --> 00:02:47.800
They're not going to help us.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.399
There are going to be those individuals

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.068
who are carrying a potential future risk,

00:02:52.068 --> 00:02:53.912
they're going to go on to get some symptom.

00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:55.700
That's not what we're looking for.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.548
What we're asking and looking for is,

00:02:57.548 --> 00:03:00.318
are there a very few set of individuals

00:03:00.318 --> 00:03:03.154
who are actually walking around

00:03:03.154 --> 00:03:07.173
with the risk that normally would cause a disease,

00:03:07.173 --> 00:03:10.136
but something in them, something hidden in them

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:11.970
is actually protective

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.145
and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms?

00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:17.198
If you're going to do a study
like that, you can imagine

00:03:17.198 --> 00:03:20.030
you'd like to look at lots and lots of people.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.322
We'd have to go and have a pretty wide study,

00:03:23.322 --> 00:03:25.057
and we realized that actually

00:03:25.057 --> 00:03:26.586
one way to think of this is,

00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:30.863
let us look at adults who are over 40 years of age,

00:03:30.863 --> 00:03:33.833
and let's make sure that we look at those

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:35.313
who were healthy as kids.

00:03:35.313 --> 00:03:37.715
They might have had individuals in their families

00:03:37.715 --> 00:03:39.527
who had had a childhood disease,

00:03:39.527 --> 00:03:41.033
but not necessarily.

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:43.800
And let's go and then screen those

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.793
to find those who are carrying genes

00:03:45.793 --> 00:03:47.471
for childhood diseases.

00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:49.035
Now, some of you, I can see you

00:03:49.035 --> 00:03:52.330
putting your hands up going, "Uh, a little odd.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.747
What's your evidence

00:03:53.747 --> 00:03:55.409
that this could be feasible?"

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.473
I want to give you two examples.

00:03:57.473 --> 00:04:00.421
The first comes from San Francisco.

00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:03.362
It comes from the 1980s and the 1990s,

00:04:03.362 --> 00:04:05.756
and you may know the story where

00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:08.153
there were individuals who had very high levels

00:04:08.153 --> 00:04:09.421
of the virus HIV.

00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:11.900
They went on to get AIDS.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.217
But there was a very small set of individuals

00:04:14.217 --> 00:04:17.185
who also had very high levels of HIV.

00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:18.571
They didn't get AIDS.

00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:21.533
And astute clinicians tracked that down,

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:24.920
and what they found was
they were carrying mutations.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.005
Notice, they were carrying mutations from birth

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:30.020
that were protective, that were protecting them

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.661
from going on to get AIDS.

00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:34.826
You may also know that actually a line of therapy

00:04:34.826 --> 00:04:37.946
has been coming along based on that fact.

00:04:37.946 --> 00:04:41.170
Second example, more recent, is elegant work

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.573
done by Helen Hobbs,

00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:45.235
who said, "I'm going to look at individuals

00:04:45.235 --> 00:04:47.951
who have very high lipid levels,

00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:49.890
and I'm going to try to find those people

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.692
with high lipid levels

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:53.860
who don't go on to get heart disease."

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.298
And again, what she found was

00:04:56.298 --> 00:04:58.858
some of those individuals had mutations

00:04:58.858 --> 00:05:01.577
that were protective from birth that kept them,

00:05:01.577 --> 00:05:03.022
even though they had high lipid levels,

00:05:03.022 --> 00:05:06.393
and you can see this is an interesting way

00:05:06.393 --> 00:05:08.354
of thinking about how you could develop

00:05:08.354 --> 00:05:10.614
preventive therapies.

00:05:10.614 --> 00:05:12.558
The project that we're working on

00:05:12.558 --> 00:05:15.020
is called "The Resilience Project:

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.420
A Search for Unexpected Heroes,"

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.910
because what we are interested in doing is saying,

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.558
can we find those rare individuals

00:05:21.558 --> 00:05:25.883
who might have these hidden protective factors?

00:05:25.883 --> 00:05:28.863
And in some ways, think of it as a decoder ring,

00:05:28.863 --> 00:05:30.789
a sort of resilience decoder ring

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.421
that we're going to try to build.

00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:36.270
We've realized that we should 
do this in a systematic way,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.897
so we've said, let's take every single

00:05:38.897 --> 00:05:40.140
childhood inherited disease.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.704
Let's take them all, and let's
pull them back a little bit

00:05:42.704 --> 00:05:45.890
by those that are known to have severe symptoms,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.810
where the parents, the child,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:48.860
those around them would know

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.190
that they'd gotten sick,

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.890
and let's go ahead and then frame them again

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.471
by those parts of the genes where we know

00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:58.978
that there is a particular alteration

00:05:58.978 --> 00:06:01.776
that is known to be highly penetrant

00:06:01.776 --> 00:06:04.430
to cause that disease.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.658
Where are we going to look?

00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:08.146
Well, we could look locally. That makes sense.

00:06:08.146 --> 00:06:10.407
But we began to think, maybe we should look

00:06:10.407 --> 00:06:11.858
all over the world.

00:06:11.858 --> 00:06:13.511
Maybe we should look not just here

00:06:13.511 --> 00:06:15.471
but in remote places where their might be

00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:18.501
a distinct genetic context,

00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:20.143
there might be environmental factors

00:06:20.143 --> 00:06:21.525
that protect people.

00:06:21.525 --> 00:06:25.987
And let's look at a million individuals.

00:06:25.987 --> 00:06:28.957
Now the reason why we think it's a good time

00:06:28.957 --> 00:06:30.029
to do that now

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:31.789
is, in the last couple of years,

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.377
there's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:36.612
to do this type of analysis,

00:06:36.612 --> 00:06:38.351
this type of data generation,

00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:40.959
to where it actually costs less to do

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:43.153
the data generation and analysis

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:46.337
than it does to do the sample
processing and the collection.

00:06:46.337 --> 00:06:50.641
The other reason is that in the last five years,

00:06:50.641 --> 00:06:52.605
there have been awesome tools,

00:06:52.605 --> 00:06:55.267
things about network biology, systems biology,

00:06:55.267 --> 00:06:57.228
that have come up that allow us to think

00:06:57.228 --> 00:06:59.168
that maybe we could decipher

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:01.649
those positive outliers.

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:03.821
And as we went around talking to researchers

00:07:03.821 --> 00:07:05.725
and institutions

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.294
and telling them about our story,

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:08.961
something happened.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.190
They started saying, "This is interesting.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.537
I would be glad to join your effort.

00:07:14.537 --> 00:07:16.464
I would be willing to participate."

00:07:16.464 --> 00:07:19.043
And they didn't say, "Where's the MTA?"

00:07:19.043 --> 00:07:22.336
They didn't say, "Where is my authorship?"

00:07:22.336 --> 00:07:26.947
They didn't say, "Is this data going 
to be mine? Am I going to own it?"

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:29.226
They basically said, "Let's work on this

00:07:29.226 --> 00:07:32.107
in an open, crowd-sourced, team way

00:07:32.107 --> 00:07:35.181
to do this decoding."

00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:37.696
Six months ago, we locked down

00:07:37.696 --> 00:07:41.011
the screening key for this decoder.

00:07:41.011 --> 00:07:45.589
My co-lead, a brilliant scientist, Eric Schadt

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:48.895
at the Icahn Mount Sinai
School of Medicine in New York,

00:07:48.895 --> 00:07:50.287
and his team,

00:07:50.287 --> 00:07:53.156
locked in that decoder key ring,

00:07:53.156 --> 00:07:55.551
and we began looking for samples,

00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:57.037
because what we realized is,

00:07:57.037 --> 00:07:58.831
maybe we could just go and look

00:07:58.831 --> 00:08:01.917
at some existing samples to
get some sense of feasibility.

00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:04.494
Maybe we could take two, three 
percent of the project on,

00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:05.911
and see if it was there.

00:08:05.911 --> 00:08:07.909
And so we started asking people

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:11.446
such as Hakon at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.

00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:13.691
We asked Leif up in Finland.

00:08:13.691 --> 00:08:17.364
We talked to Anne Wojcicki at 23andMe,

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:19.131
and Wang Jun at BGI,

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:21.319
and again, something remarkable happened.

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:23.128
They said, "Huh,

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.872
not only do we have samples,

00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:27.068
but often we've analyzed them,

00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:28.555
and we would be glad to go into

00:08:28.555 --> 00:08:29.958
our anonymized samples

00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.020
and see if we could find those

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.183
that you're looking for."

00:08:33.183 --> 00:08:35.890
And instead of being 20,000 or 30,000,

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.042
last month we passed one half million samples

00:08:39.042 --> 00:08:40.947
that we've already analyzed.

00:08:40.947 --> 00:08:42.440
So you must be going,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:48.065
"Huh, did you find any unexpected heroes?"

00:08:48.065 --> 00:08:50.648
And the answer is, we didn't find one or two.

00:08:50.648 --> 00:08:53.686
We found dozens of these strong candidate

00:08:53.686 --> 00:08:55.415
unexpected heroes.

00:08:55.415 --> 00:08:58.112
So we think that the time is now

00:08:58.112 --> 00:09:00.452
to launch the beta phase of this project

00:09:00.452 --> 00:09:03.569
and actually start getting prospective individuals.

00:09:03.569 --> 00:09:06.740
Basically all we need is information.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.399
We need a swab of DNA

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:11.804
and a willingness to say, "What's inside me?

00:09:11.804 --> 00:09:15.067
I'm willing to be re-contacted."

00:09:15.067 --> 00:09:18.858
Most of us spend our lives,

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:20.812
when it comes to health and disease,

00:09:20.812 --> 00:09:23.892
acting as if we're voyeurs.

00:09:23.892 --> 00:09:26.229
We delegate the responsibility

00:09:26.229 --> 00:09:28.272
for the understanding of our disease,

00:09:28.272 --> 00:09:30.144
for the treatment of our disease,

00:09:30.144 --> 00:09:33.680
to anointed experts.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.020
In order for us to get this project to work,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.170
we need individuals to step up

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.062
in a different role and to be engaged,

00:09:43.062 --> 00:09:45.987
to realize this dream,

00:09:45.987 --> 00:09:49.122
this open crowd-sourced project,

00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:52.802
to find those unexpected heroes,

00:09:52.802 --> 00:09:55.462
to evolve from the current concepts

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:57.796
of resources and constraints,

00:09:57.796 --> 00:10:01.047
to design those preventive therapies,

00:10:01.047 --> 00:10:03.820
and to extend it beyond childhood diseases,

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.397
to go all the way up to ways

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:09.268
that we could look at Alzheimer's or Parkinson's,

00:10:09.268 --> 00:10:11.530
we're going to need us

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.636
to be looking inside ourselves and asking,

00:10:14.636 --> 00:10:16.840
"What are our roles?

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.513
What are our genes?"

00:10:18.513 --> 00:10:21.298
and looking within ourselves for information

00:10:21.298 --> 00:10:23.940
we used to say we should go to the outside,

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.148
to experts,

00:10:25.148 --> 00:10:29.200
and to be willing to share that with others.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.758
Thank you very much.

00:10:32.758 --> 00:10:34.573
