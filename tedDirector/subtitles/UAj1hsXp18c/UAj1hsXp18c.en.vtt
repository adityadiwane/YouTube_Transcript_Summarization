00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
"What I Will"

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I will not dance to your war drum.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
I will not dance to that beating.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I know that beat.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
It is lifeless.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
I know intimately that skin you are hitting.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
It was alive once,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
hunted, stolen,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
stretched.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I will not dance to your drummed-up war.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
I will not pop, spin, break for you.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I will not hate for you

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
or even hate you.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
I will not kill for you.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Especially I will not die for you.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I will not side with you or dance to bombs

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
because everyone is dancing.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Everyone can be wrong.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Life is a right, not collateral or casual.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
I will not forget where I come from.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
I will craft my own drum.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Gather my beloved near,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and our chanting will be dancing.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Our humming will be drumming.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
I will not be played.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.260
I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.260
I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
This heartbeat is louder than death.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Your war drum ain't louder

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.260
than this breath. Haaa.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
What's up TED people? Let me hear you make some noise.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
(Applause)

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
A bunch of pacifists.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Confused, aspiring pacifists.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
I understand.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
I've been wrong a lot lately.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Like a lot.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
So I couldn't figure out

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
what to read today.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
What that means is prepping my outfit,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
(Laughter)

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
prepping options,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
trying to figure out what I'm coming behind

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and going in front of.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Poetry does that.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
It preps you. It aims you.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
So I am going to read a poem

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
that was chosen just now.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
But I'm going to need you

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
to just sit for like 10 minutes

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
and hold a woman who is not here.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Hold her now

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
with you.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Are you holding her?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
This is "Break Clustered."

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.260
All holy history banned.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
Unwritten books predicted the future, projected the past.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
But my head unwraps

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
around what appears limitless,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
man's creative violence.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Whose son shall it be?

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Which male child will perish a new day?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Our boys' deaths galvanize.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
We cherish corpses.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
We mourn women, complicated.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Bitches get beat daily.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Profits made, prophets ignored.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
All colors run, none of us solid.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
I live cycles of light and darkness.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Rhythm is half silence.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
I see now, I never was one and not the other.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Sickness, health, tender violence.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
I think now I never was pure.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Before form I was storm,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
blind, ign'ant -- still am.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Human contracted itself blind, malignant.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
I never was pure.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Girl spoiled before ripened.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Language can't math me.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
I experience exponentially.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Everything is everything.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.260
One woman loses 15, maybe 20, members of her family.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
One woman loses six.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
One woman loses her head.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
One woman straps herself.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
One woman gives birth to a baby.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
One woman gives birth to borders.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
One woman no longer believes love will ever find her.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
One woman never did.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Where do refugee hearts go?

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Broken, dissed,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Faced with absence.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
We mourn each one

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
or we mean nothing at all.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
My spine curves spiral.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Precipice running to and running from human beings.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Cluster bombs left behind.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
De facto landmines.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
A smoldering grief.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Harvest contaminated tobacco.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Harvest bombs.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Harvest baby teeth.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Harvest palms, smoke.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Harvest witness, smoke.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Resolutions, smoke.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Salvation, smoke.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Redemption, smoke.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Breathe.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Do not fear

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
what has blown up.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
If you must,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.260
fear the unexploded.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Thank you.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.260
(Applause)
