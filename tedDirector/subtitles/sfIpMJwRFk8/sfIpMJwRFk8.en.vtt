00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
A month ago today

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
I stood there:

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
90 degrees south, the top of

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
the bottom of the world, the Geographic South Pole.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160
Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
Together we had just broken the world speed record

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
for a trek to the South Pole.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
It took us 33 days,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
23 hours and 55 minutes to get there.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.160
We shaved five days off the previous best time.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
And in the process, I became the first person in history

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
to make the entire 650-mile journey,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
from Hercules Inlet to South Pole,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
solely on feet, without skis.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
Now, many of you are probably saying, "Wait a sec,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
is this tough to do?"

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.160
(Laughter)

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
Imagine, if you will,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
dragging a sled, as you just saw in that video clip,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
with 170 pounds of gear,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
in it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
It's going to be 40 below, every single day.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
You'll be in a massive headwind.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
And at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
these crevasses.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
Some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
that could give way at a moment's notice,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.160
taking your sled, you, into the abyss, never to be seen again.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
The punchline to your journey? Look at the horizon.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
Yes, it's uphill the entire way,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
because the South Pole is at 10,000 feet,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.160
and you're starting at sea level.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
Our journey did not, in fact, begin at Hercules Inlet,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
It began a little less than two years ago.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
A couple of buddies of mine and I

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.160
had finished a 111-day run across the entire Sahara desert.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
And while we were there we learned

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
the seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
We also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.160
affected young people the most.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
I came home to my wife after 111 days of running in the sand,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
and I said, "You know, there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to."

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
But if I'm going to continue doing these adventures, there has to be

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
a reason for me to do them

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
beyond just getting there.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
Around that time I met an extraordinary human being,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
Peter Thum, who inspired me with his actions.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.160
He's trying to find and solve water issues, the crisis around the world.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
His dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition:

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
a run to the South Pole

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
where, with an interactive website,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
I will be able to bring young people, students and teachers from around the world

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
on board the expedition with me,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
as active members.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.160
So we would have a live website, that every single day of the 33 days,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
we would be blogging, telling stories of,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
you know, depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
or we will burn.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
Crossing miles and miles of sastrugi --

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.160
frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
I'm telling you, crossing these things with 170-pound sled,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
because that's what it felt like.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
We were blogging to this live website daily

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
to these students that were tracking us as well,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
about 10-hour trekking days,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
15-hour trekking days,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.160
sometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
We'd catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled, incidentally.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
In turn, students,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
people from around the world, would ask us questions.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
Young people would ask the most amazing questions.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.160
One of my favorite: It's 40 below, you've got to go to the bathroom,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
where are you going to go and how are you going to do it?

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.160
I'm not going to answer that. But I will answer some of the more popular questions.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
Where do you sleep? We slept in a tent that was very low to the ground,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
because the winds on Antarctica were so extreme, it would blow anything else away.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
What do you eat? One of my favorite dishes on expedition:

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
butter and bacon. It's about a million calories.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
We were burning about 8,500 a day,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
so we needed it.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
How many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have?

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
Virtually none. All of our equipment, including film equipment,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
was charged by the sun.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
And do you get along? I certainly hope so,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
because at some point or another on this expedition,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
and put it in an infected blister, and drain it for you.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
But seriously, seriously, we did get along,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
They were our teammates! They were inspiring us.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.160
The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
The website worked brilliantly as a two-way street of communication.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Young people in northern Canada, kids in an elementary school,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
dragging sleds across the school-yard,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.160
pretending they were Richard, Ray and Kevin. Amazing.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
We arrived at the South Pole. We huddled into that tent,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
45 below that day, I'll never forget it.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
We looked at each other with these looks

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.160
of disbelief at what we had just completed.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
And I remember looking at the guys thinking,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
"What do I take from this journey?" You know? Seriously.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
That I'm this uber-endurance guy?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
As I stand here today talking to you guys,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
I've been running for the grand sum of five years.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.160
And a year before that I was a pack-a-day smoker,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
living a very sedentary lifestyle.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
What I take from this journey, from my journeys,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
is that, in fact,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
within every fiber of my belief standing here,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
I know that we can make the impossible possible.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
I'm learning this at 40.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.160
Can you imagine? Seriously, can you imagine?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
I'm learning this at 40 years of age.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
Imagine being 13 years old,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
hearing those words, and believing it.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.160
(Applause)
