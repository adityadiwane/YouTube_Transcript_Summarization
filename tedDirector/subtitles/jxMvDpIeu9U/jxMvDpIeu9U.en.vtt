00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Namaste. Salaam.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Shalom. Sat Sri Akal.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Greetings to all of you from Pakistan.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
It is often said that we fear that which we do not know.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And Pakistan, in this particular vein, is very similar.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Because it has provoked, and does provoke,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.260
a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
of turbulence and turmoil.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And what follows is a stream of images,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
a series of images captured by some of Pakistan's

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
most dynamic and young photographers,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
that aims to give you an alternative glimpse,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
a look inside the hearts and minds

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
of some ordinary Pakistani citizens.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.260
Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
My name is Abdul Khan. I come from Peshawar.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
I hope that you will be able to see

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
not just my Taliban-like beard,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
but also the richness and color

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
of my perceptions, aspirations and dreams,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
I hope to become a vet when I grow up

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
who wander around the streets of the village

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.260
that I live near Gilgit, northern Pakistan.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
My name is Kailash. And I like to enrich lives

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
through technicolored glass.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Madame, would you like some of those orange bangles

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
with the pink polka dots?

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
My name is Zamin.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And I'm an IDP, an internally displaced person,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
from Swat.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Do you see me on the other side of this fence?

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Do I matter, or really exist for you?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
My name is Iman. I am a fashion model,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
an up-and-coming model from Lahore.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Do you see me simply smothered in cloth?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Or can you move beyond my veil

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and see me for who I truly am inside?

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
My name is Ahmed. I am an Afghan refugee

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
from the Khyber agency.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I have come from a place of intense darkness.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And that is why I want to illuminate the world.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
My name is Papusay.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
My heart and drum beat as one.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
If religion is the opium of the masses,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.260
then for me, music is my one and only ganja.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
A rising tide lifts all boats.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And the rising tide of India's

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
spectacular economic growth

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
has lifted over 400 million

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Indians into a buoyant middle class.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
But there are still over 650 million Indians,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nepalese,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
who remain washed up on the shores of poverty.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Therefore as India and Pakistan, as you and I,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
it behooves us to transcend our differences,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
to celebrate our diversity,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.260
to leverage our common humanity.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Our collective vision at Naya Jeevan,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
which for many of you, as you all recognize,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
means "new life" in Urdu and Hindi,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.260
is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
by providing them with affordable access

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
to catastrophic health care.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Indeed it is the emerging world's first

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
HMO for the urban working poor.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis?

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
We are but two threads cut from the same cloth.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And if our fates are intertwined,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
then we believe that it is good karma, it is good fortune.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And for many of us, our fortunes do indeed lie

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
at the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.260
(Applause)

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Chris Anderson: Fantastic. Just stay up here.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
That was fantastic.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.260
I found that really moving.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
You know, we fought hard to get at least

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
a small Pakistani contingent to come.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
It felt like it was really important.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
They went through a lot to get here.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please?

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
I just really wanted to acknowledge you.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:21.260
(Applause)

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Thank you so much.
