00:00:15.902 --> 00:00:19.801
People are living longer
and societies are getting grayer.

00:00:20.373 --> 00:00:22.101
You hear about it all the time.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:24.024
You read about it in your newspapers.

00:00:24.048 --> 00:00:26.394
You hear about it on your television sets.

00:00:26.418 --> 00:00:27.682
Sometimes, I'm concerned

00:00:27.706 --> 00:00:32.314
that we hear about it so much
that we've come to accept longer lives

00:00:32.338 --> 00:00:36.171
with a kind of a complacency, even ease.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:41.485
But make no mistake, longer lives can --

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:47.392
and, I believe, will improve
quality of life at all ages.

00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:52.092
Now to put this in perspective,
let me just zoom out for a minute.

00:00:53.084 --> 00:00:58.980
More years were added to average
life expectancy in the 20th century

00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:07.061
than all years added
across all prior millennia

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:09.259
of human evolution combined.

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:12.063
In the blink of an eye,

00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:15.459
we nearly doubled the length of time
that we're living.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:19.988
So if you ever feel like you don't have
this aging thing quite pegged,

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:21.326
don't kick yourself.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.236
It's brand new.

00:01:23.887 --> 00:01:28.038
And because fertility rates fell
across that very same period

00:01:28.062 --> 00:01:30.558
that life expectancy was going up,

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:37.448
that pyramid that has always represented
the distribution of age in the population,

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:42.498
with many young ones at the bottom
winnowed to a tiny peak of older people

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:44.759
who make it and survive to old age,

00:01:44.783 --> 00:01:48.653
is being reshaped into a rectangle.

00:01:50.728 --> 00:01:52.536
And now, if you're the kind of person

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.917
who can get chills
from population statistics,

00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:55.964
(Laughter)

00:01:55.988 --> 00:01:57.782
these are the ones that should do it.

00:01:57.806 --> 00:01:59.236
Because what that means

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.100
is that for the first time
in the history of the species,

00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:06.894
the majority of babies born
in the developed world

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:10.734
are having the opportunity to grow old.

00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:14.236
How did this happen?

00:02:14.698 --> 00:02:18.706
Well, we're no genetically hardier
than our ancestors were 10,000 years ago.

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:23.550
This increase in life expectancy
is the remarkable product of culture --

00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:27.775
the crucible that holds
science and technology

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.235
and wide-scale changes in behavior
that improve health and well-being.

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:40.703
Through cultural changes, our ancestors
largely eliminated early death

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:43.552
so that people can now
live out their full lives.

00:02:44.784 --> 00:02:47.729
Now there are problems
associated with aging --

00:02:47.753 --> 00:02:50.044
diseases, poverty, loss of social status.

00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:52.236
It's hardly time to rest on our laurels.

00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:55.107
But the more we learn about aging,

00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:59.170
the clearer it becomes
that a sweeping downward course

00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:01.236
is grossly inaccurate.

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:05.482
Aging brings some rather
remarkable improvements --

00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:08.236
increased knowledge, expertise --

00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:13.735
and emotional aspects of life improve.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.999
That's right, older people are happy.

00:03:19.788 --> 00:03:23.386
They're happier than middle-aged people,
and younger people, certainly.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.592
(Laughter)

00:03:24.616 --> 00:03:27.730
Study after study
is coming to the same conclusion.

00:03:27.754 --> 00:03:30.586
The CDC recently conducted a survey

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.494
where they asked respondents
simply to tell them

00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:36.633
whether they experienced
significant psychological distress

00:03:36.657 --> 00:03:37.819
in the previous week.

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:41.477
And fewer older people
answered affirmatively to that question

00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:44.235
than middle-aged people,
and younger people as well.

00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:48.091
And a recent Gallup poll
asked participants

00:03:48.115 --> 00:03:52.601
how much stress and worry and anger
they had experienced the previous day.

00:03:52.918 --> 00:03:57.047
And stress, worry, anger

00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.260
all decrease with age.

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:03.873
Now social scientists call this
the paradox of aging.

00:04:03.897 --> 00:04:06.589
I mean, after all,
aging is not a piece of cake.

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:11.625
So we've asked all sorts of questions
to see if we could undo this finding.

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:18.085
We've asked whether it may be that
the current generations of older people

00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:21.131
are and always have been
the greatest generations.

00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:25.537
That is that younger people today
may not typically experience

00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:27.889
these improvements as they grow older.

00:04:28.487 --> 00:04:29.811
We've asked,

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:33.778
well, maybe older people
are just trying to put a positive spin

00:04:33.802 --> 00:04:36.215
on an otherwise depressing existence.

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:37.986
(Laughter)

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.863
But the more we've tried
to disavow this finding,

00:04:40.887 --> 00:04:43.385
the more evidence we find to support it.

00:04:44.806 --> 00:04:47.141
Years ago, my colleagues
and I embarked on a study

00:04:47.165 --> 00:04:50.253
where we followed the same group
of people over a 10-year period.

00:04:50.277 --> 00:04:53.236
Originally, the sample was aged 18 to 94.

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:57.093
And we studied whether and how
their emotional experiences changed

00:04:57.117 --> 00:04:59.022
as they grew older.

00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:02.357
Our participants would carry
electronic pagers

00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:03.882
for a week at a time,

00:05:03.906 --> 00:05:07.205
and we'd page them throughout the day
and evenings at random times.

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.019
And every time we paged them,

00:05:09.043 --> 00:05:11.095
we'd ask them to answer
several questions --

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:14.184
"On a one to seven scale,
how happy are you right now?"

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:15.693
"How sad are you right now?"

00:05:15.717 --> 00:05:17.868
"How frustrated are you right now?" --

00:05:17.892 --> 00:05:22.126
so that we could get a sense of the kinds
of emotions and feelings they were having

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.530
in their day-to-day lives.

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:27.603
And using this intense study
of individuals,

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:31.481
we find that it's not
one particular generation

00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:33.766
that's doing better than the others,

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.664
but the same individuals over time

00:05:36.688 --> 00:05:41.547
come to report relatively greater
positive experience.

00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:46.009
Now you see this slight downturn
at very advanced ages.

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:47.670
And there is a slight downturn.

00:05:47.694 --> 00:05:52.683
But at no point does it return
to the levels we see in early adulthood.

00:05:53.888 --> 00:06:00.888
Now it's really too simplistic
to say that older people are "happy."

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:04.235
In our study, they are more positive.

00:06:05.088 --> 00:06:07.405
But they're also more likely
than younger people

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:09.602
to experience mixed emotions --

00:06:09.626 --> 00:06:12.243
sadness at the same time
you experience happiness;

00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:15.711
you know, that tear in the eye
when you're smiling at a friend.

00:06:16.894 --> 00:06:21.537
And other research has shown that
older people seem to engage with sadness

00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:22.967
more comfortably.

00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:25.875
They're more accepting of sadness
than younger people are.

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:28.492
And we suspect
that this may help to explain

00:06:28.516 --> 00:06:31.236
why older people are better
than younger people

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.512
at solving hotly charged
emotional conflicts and debates.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.546
Older people can view injustice
with compassion,

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.562
but not despair.

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:46.356
And all things being equal,

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.471
older people direct their cognitive
resources, like attention and memory,

00:06:50.495 --> 00:06:53.236
to positive information
more than negative.

00:06:53.876 --> 00:06:57.228
If we show older, middle-aged,
younger people images,

00:06:57.252 --> 00:06:59.236
like the ones you see on the screen,

00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.584
and we later ask them
to recall all the images that they can,

00:07:05.145 --> 00:07:07.504
older people, but not younger people,

00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:11.235
remember more positive images
than negative images.

00:07:11.912 --> 00:07:16.050
We've asked older and younger people
to view faces in laboratory studies,

00:07:16.074 --> 00:07:17.950
some frowning, some smiling.

00:07:17.974 --> 00:07:23.096
Older people look toward the smiling faces
and away from the frowning, angry faces.

00:07:24.517 --> 00:07:29.625
In day-to-day life, this translates
into greater enjoyment and satisfaction.

00:07:31.793 --> 00:07:36.082
But as social scientists, we continue
to ask about possible alternatives.

00:07:36.106 --> 00:07:39.760
We've said, well, maybe older people
report more positive emotions

00:07:39.784 --> 00:07:42.236
because they're cognitively impaired.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.580
(Laughter)

00:07:46.136 --> 00:07:47.367
We've said, could it be

00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:50.985
that positive emotions are simply easier
to process than negative emotions,

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:54.178
and so you switch
to the positive emotions?

00:07:54.202 --> 00:07:56.337
Maybe our neural centers in our brain

00:07:56.361 --> 00:08:00.483
are degraded such that we're unable
to process negative emotions anymore.

00:08:00.832 --> 00:08:02.341
But that's not the case.

00:08:02.874 --> 00:08:06.110
The most mentally sharp older adults

00:08:06.134 --> 00:08:09.236
are the ones who show
this positivity effect the most.

00:08:10.209 --> 00:08:12.491
And under conditions
where it really matters,

00:08:12.515 --> 00:08:15.043
older people do process
the negative information

00:08:15.067 --> 00:08:17.236
just as well as the positive information.

00:08:17.618 --> 00:08:19.581
So how can this be?

00:08:21.136 --> 00:08:23.109
Well, in our research,

00:08:23.217 --> 00:08:27.208
we've found that these changes
are grounded fundamentally

00:08:27.232 --> 00:08:30.449
in the uniquely human
ability to monitor time --

00:08:30.473 --> 00:08:33.522
not just clock time
and calendar time, but lifetime.

00:08:34.468 --> 00:08:36.486
And if there's a paradox of aging,

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.932
it's that recognizing
that we won't live forever

00:08:39.956 --> 00:08:44.213
changes our perspective on life
in positive ways.

00:08:45.464 --> 00:08:50.270
When time horizons are long and nebulous,
as they typically are in youth,

00:08:50.294 --> 00:08:52.236
people are constantly preparing,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.015
trying to soak up all the information
they possibly can,

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:58.285
taking risks, exploring.

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:01.252
We might spend time with people
we don't even like

00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:03.375
because it's somehow interesting.

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:05.595
We might learn something unexpected.

00:09:05.619 --> 00:09:07.679
(Laughter)

00:09:07.703 --> 00:09:09.236
We go on blind dates.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.513
(Laughter)

00:09:12.537 --> 00:09:13.707
You know, after all,

00:09:13.731 --> 00:09:16.236
if it doesn't work out,
there's always tomorrow.

00:09:17.381 --> 00:09:19.958
People over 50 don't go on blind dates.

00:09:19.982 --> 00:09:26.982
(Laughter)

00:09:27.274 --> 00:09:33.081
As we age, our time horizons grow shorter
and our goals change.

00:09:33.602 --> 00:09:36.594
When we recognize that we don't have
all the time in the world,

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:39.465
we see our priorities most clearly.

00:09:39.489 --> 00:09:42.210
We take less notice of trivial matters.

00:09:42.234 --> 00:09:43.735
We savor life.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.018
We're more appreciative,

00:09:46.042 --> 00:09:47.797
more open to reconciliation.

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:51.551
We invest in more emotionally
important parts of life,

00:09:51.575 --> 00:09:54.236
and life gets better,

00:09:54.684 --> 00:09:57.236
so we're happier day-to-day.

00:09:57.565 --> 00:09:59.505
But that same shift in perspective

00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:03.924
leads us to have less tolerance
than ever for injustice.

00:10:05.321 --> 00:10:06.896
By 2015,

00:10:07.397 --> 00:10:10.035
there will be more people
in the United States

00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:13.396
over the age of 60 than under 15.

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:19.441
What will happen to societies
that are top-heavy with older people?

00:10:20.623 --> 00:10:23.915
The numbers won't determine the outcome.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.954
Culture will.

00:10:27.463 --> 00:10:30.568
If we invest in science and technology

00:10:30.592 --> 00:10:34.582
and find solutions for the real problems
that older people face

00:10:35.444 --> 00:10:41.541
and we capitalize on the very real
strengths of older people,

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.970
then added years of life can dramatically
improve quality of life at all ages.

00:10:49.157 --> 00:10:53.624
Societies with millions of talented,
emotionally stable citizens

00:10:53.648 --> 00:10:58.575
who are healthier and better educated
than any generations before them,

00:10:58.599 --> 00:11:02.425
armed with knowledge
about the practical matters of life

00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:06.738
and motivated to solve the big issues

00:11:07.556 --> 00:11:12.323
can be better societies
than we have ever known.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.986
My father, who is 92, likes to say,

00:11:19.038 --> 00:11:22.607
"Let's stop talking
only about how to save the old folks

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:27.224
and start talking about
how to get them to save us all."

00:11:29.097 --> 00:11:30.537
Thank you.

00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:33.355
(Applause)
