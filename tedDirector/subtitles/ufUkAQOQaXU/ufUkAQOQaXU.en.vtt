00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:18.543
Other people. Everyone is interested in other people.

00:00:18.543 --> 00:00:20.666
Everyone has relationships with other people,

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.258
and they're interested in these relationships

00:00:22.258 --> 00:00:24.113
for a variety of reasons.

00:00:24.113 --> 00:00:26.125
Good relationships, bad relationships,

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.271
annoying relationships, agnostic relationships,

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:32.695
and what I'm going to do is focus on the central piece

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:35.998
of an interaction that goes on in a relationship.

00:00:35.998 --> 00:00:38.334
So I'm going to take as inspiration the fact that we're all

00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:40.759
interested in interacting with other people,

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:44.591
I'm going to completely strip it of all its complicating features,

00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:48.485
and I'm going to turn that object, that simplified object,

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:52.635
into a scientific probe, and provide the early stages,

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.084
embryonic stages of new insights into what happens

00:00:55.084 --> 00:00:58.734
in two brains while they simultaneously interact.

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:01.027
But before I do that, let me tell you a couple of things

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:02.726
that made this possible.

00:01:02.726 --> 00:01:05.507
The first is we can now eavesdrop safely

00:01:05.507 --> 00:01:08.218
on healthy brain activity.

00:01:08.218 --> 00:01:10.795
Without needles and radioactivity,

00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:13.658
without any kind of clinical reason, we can go down the street

00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:16.785
and record from your friends' and neighbors' brains

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.323
while they do a variety of cognitive tasks, and we use

00:01:19.323 --> 00:01:23.057
a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging.

00:01:23.057 --> 00:01:25.382
You've probably all read about it or heard about in some

00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:29.760
incarnation. Let me give you a two-sentence version of it.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.244
So we've all heard of MRIs. MRIs use magnetic fields

00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:35.273
and radio waves and they take snapshots of your brain

00:01:35.273 --> 00:01:37.634
or your knee or your stomach,

00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:39.679
grayscale images that are frozen in time.

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.000
In the 1990s, it was discovered you could use

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.659
the same machines in a different mode,

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.005
and in that mode, you could make microscopic blood flow

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:50.305
movies from hundreds of thousands of sites independently in the brain.

00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:53.505
Okay, so what? In fact, the so what is, in the brain,

00:01:53.505 --> 00:01:57.337
changes in neural activity, the things that make your brain work,

00:01:57.337 --> 00:01:59.347
the things that make your software work in your brain,

00:01:59.347 --> 00:02:01.836
are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow.

00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:03.809
You make a blood flow movie, you have an independent

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:06.148
proxy of brain activity.

00:02:06.148 --> 00:02:09.182
This has literally revolutionized cognitive science.

00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:11.173
Take any cognitive domain you want, memory,

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:13.314
motor planning, thinking about your mother-in-law,

00:02:13.314 --> 00:02:17.029
getting angry at people, emotional response, it goes on and on,

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:20.118
put people into functional MRI devices, and

00:02:20.118 --> 00:02:23.501
image how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity.

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:26.350
It's in its early stages, and it's crude by some measures,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.918
but in fact, 20 years ago, we were at nothing.

00:02:28.918 --> 00:02:31.277
You couldn't do people like this. You couldn't do healthy people.

00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:33.765
That's caused a literal revolution, and it's opened us up

00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:36.583
to a new experimental preparation. Neurobiologists,

00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:40.343
as you well know, have lots of experimental preps,

00:02:40.343 --> 00:02:43.484
worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this.

00:02:43.484 --> 00:02:46.881
And now, we have a new experimental prep: human beings.

00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:50.642
We can now use human beings to study and model

00:02:50.642 --> 00:02:53.592
the software in human beings, and we have a few

00:02:53.592 --> 00:02:56.427
burgeoning biological measures.

00:02:56.427 --> 00:03:00.314
Okay, let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do,

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:02.991
and it's in the area of what you'd call valuation.

00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:05.126
Valuation is just what you think it is, you know?

00:03:05.126 --> 00:03:07.930
If you went and you were valuing two companies against

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.666
one another, you'd want to know which was more valuable.

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:14.545
Cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago.

00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:17.235
If you want to compare oranges to windshields, what do you do?

00:03:17.235 --> 00:03:19.591
Well, you can't compare oranges to windshields.

00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:21.846
They're immiscible. They don't mix with one another.

00:03:21.846 --> 00:03:24.197
So instead, you convert them to a common currency scale,

00:03:24.197 --> 00:03:26.903
put them on that scale, and value them accordingly.

00:03:26.903 --> 00:03:30.339
Well, your brain has to do something just like that as well,

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:32.827
and we're now beginning to understand and identify

00:03:32.827 --> 00:03:34.964
brain systems involved in valuation,

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:37.596
and one of them includes a neurotransmitter system

00:03:37.596 --> 00:03:40.228
whose cells are located in your brainstem

00:03:40.228 --> 00:03:43.403
and deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain.

00:03:43.403 --> 00:03:45.845
I won't go through the details of it, but that's an important

00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:48.002
discovery, and we know a good bit about that now,

00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:50.232
and it's just a small piece of it, but it's important because

00:03:50.232 --> 00:03:53.507
those are the neurons that you would lose if you had Parkinson's disease,

00:03:53.507 --> 00:03:55.523
and they're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally

00:03:55.523 --> 00:03:57.755
every drug of abuse, and that makes sense.

00:03:57.755 --> 00:04:00.091
Drugs of abuse would come in, and they would change

00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:01.880
the way you value the world. They change the way

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.079
you value the symbols associated with your drug of choice,

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.593
and they make you value that over everything else.

00:04:07.593 --> 00:04:10.614
Here's the key feature though. These neurons are also

00:04:10.614 --> 00:04:14.115
involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas,

00:04:14.115 --> 00:04:16.156
and I put some symbols up here that we assign value to

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:18.876
for various reasons.

00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:21.565
We have a behavioral superpower in our brain,

00:04:21.565 --> 00:04:23.318
and it at least in part involves dopamine.

00:04:23.318 --> 00:04:27.507
We can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea,

00:04:27.507 --> 00:04:31.512
for a mere idea. No other species can do that.

00:04:31.512 --> 00:04:35.118
In 1997, the cult Heaven's Gate committed mass suicide

00:04:35.118 --> 00:04:37.333
predicated on the idea that there was a spaceship

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:41.118
hiding in the tail of the then-visible comet Hale-Bopp

00:04:41.118 --> 00:04:45.390
waiting to take them to the next level. It was an incredibly tragic event.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.875
More than two thirds of them had college degrees.

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:52.598
But the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival

00:04:52.598 --> 00:04:55.464
using exactly the same systems that were put there

00:04:55.464 --> 00:04:59.506
to make them survive. That's a lot of control, okay?

00:04:59.506 --> 00:05:01.595
One thing that I've left out of this narrative

00:05:01.595 --> 00:05:03.829
is the obvious thing, which is the focus of the rest of my

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:05.988
little talk, and that is other people.

00:05:05.988 --> 00:05:08.984
These same valuation systems are redeployed

00:05:08.984 --> 00:05:11.476
when we're valuing interactions with other people.

00:05:11.476 --> 00:05:14.747
So this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs,

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:17.271
that makes you freeze when you get Parkinson's disease,

00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:20.348
that contributes to various forms of psychosis,

00:05:20.348 --> 00:05:24.268
is also redeployed to value interactions with other people

00:05:24.268 --> 00:05:27.164
and to assign value to gestures that you do

00:05:27.164 --> 00:05:29.738
when you're interacting with somebody else.

00:05:29.738 --> 00:05:32.315
Let me give you an example of this.

00:05:32.315 --> 00:05:35.282
You bring to the table such enormous processing power

00:05:35.282 --> 00:05:37.906
in this domain that you hardly even notice it.

00:05:37.906 --> 00:05:39.373
Let me just give you a few examples. So here's a baby.

00:05:39.373 --> 00:05:43.103
She's three months old. She still poops in her diapers and she can't do calculus.

00:05:43.103 --> 00:05:46.456
She's related to me. Somebody will be very glad that she's up here on the screen.

00:05:46.456 --> 00:05:48.832
You can cover up one of her eyes, and you can still read

00:05:48.832 --> 00:05:51.587
something in the other eye, and I see sort of curiosity

00:05:51.587 --> 00:05:55.184
in one eye, I see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other.

00:05:55.184 --> 00:05:58.363
Here's a couple. They're sharing a moment together,

00:05:58.363 --> 00:05:59.681
and we've even done an experiment where you can cut out

00:05:59.681 --> 00:06:02.688
different pieces of this frame and you can still see

00:06:02.688 --> 00:06:05.192
that they're sharing it. They're sharing it sort of in parallel.

00:06:05.192 --> 00:06:07.655
Now, the elements of the scene also communicate this

00:06:07.655 --> 00:06:09.890
to us, but you can read it straight off their faces,

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.393
and if you compare their faces to normal faces, it would be a very subtle cue.

00:06:13.393 --> 00:06:16.740
Here's another couple. He's projecting out at us,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.628
and she's clearly projecting, you know,

00:06:19.628 --> 00:06:21.891
love and admiration at him.

00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:25.526
Here's another couple. (Laughter)

00:06:25.526 --> 00:06:30.676
And I'm thinking I'm not seeing love and admiration on the left. (Laughter)

00:06:30.676 --> 00:06:33.236
In fact, I know this is his sister, and you can just see

00:06:33.236 --> 00:06:35.749
him saying, "Okay, we're doing this for the camera,

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:41.451
and then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face." (Laughter)

00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:43.557
He'll kill me for showing that.

00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:46.354
All right, so what does this mean?

00:06:46.354 --> 00:06:49.704
It means we bring an enormous amount of processing power to the problem.

00:06:49.704 --> 00:06:53.352
It engages deep systems in our brain, in dopaminergic

00:06:53.352 --> 00:06:56.170
systems that are there to make you chase sex, food and salt.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.064
They keep you alive. It gives them the pie, it gives

00:06:59.064 --> 00:07:01.968
that kind of a behavioral punch which we've called a superpower.

00:07:01.968 --> 00:07:05.622
So how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged

00:07:05.622 --> 00:07:08.320
social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe?

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.011
And the short answer is games.

00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:15.415
Economic games. So what we do is we go into two areas.

00:07:15.415 --> 00:07:18.751
One area is called experimental economics. The other area is called behavioral economics.

00:07:18.751 --> 00:07:22.829
And we steal their games. And we contrive them to our own purposes.

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:25.796
So this shows you one particular game called an ultimatum game.

00:07:25.796 --> 00:07:27.641
Red person is given a hundred dollars and can offer

00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:31.364
a split to blue. Let's say red wants to keep 70,

00:07:31.364 --> 00:07:35.450
and offers blue 30. So he offers a 70-30 split with blue.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.301
Control passes to blue, and blue says, "I accept it,"

00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:40.257
in which case he'd get the money, or blue says,

00:07:40.257 --> 00:07:44.564
"I reject it," in which case no one gets anything. Okay?

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:47.956
So a rational choice economist would say, well,

00:07:47.956 --> 00:07:50.012
you should take all non-zero offers.

00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:53.774
What do people do? People are indifferent at an 80-20 split.

00:07:53.774 --> 00:07:57.298
At 80-20, it's a coin flip whether you accept that or not.

00:07:57.298 --> 00:08:00.189
Why is that? You know, because you're pissed off.

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:03.798
You're mad. That's an unfair offer, and you know what an unfair offer is.

00:08:03.798 --> 00:08:06.502
This is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world.

00:08:06.502 --> 00:08:09.046
That just gives you an example of the kind of thing that

00:08:09.046 --> 00:08:12.784
these games probe. The interesting thing is, these games

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:16.491
require that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line.

00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:19.419
You have to be able to come to the table with a proper model of another person.

00:08:19.419 --> 00:08:22.632
You have to be able to remember what you've done.

00:08:22.632 --> 00:08:24.052
You have to stand up in the moment to do that.

00:08:24.052 --> 00:08:27.402
Then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back,

00:08:27.402 --> 00:08:30.374
and you have to do something that is interesting,

00:08:30.374 --> 00:08:32.971
which is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:36.304
That is, you have to decide what that other person expects of you.

00:08:36.304 --> 00:08:39.258
You have to send signals to manage your image in their mind.

00:08:39.258 --> 00:08:42.111
Like a job interview. You sit across the desk from somebody,

00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:43.480
they have some prior image of you,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.231
you send signals across the desk to move their image

00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:50.151
of you from one place to a place where you want it to be.

00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:53.536
We're so good at this we don't really even notice it.

00:08:53.536 --> 00:08:57.303
These kinds of probes exploit it. Okay?

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.110
In doing this, what we've discovered is that humans

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.441
are literal canaries in social exchanges.

00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:04.838
Canaries used to be used as kind of biosensors in mines.

00:09:04.838 --> 00:09:08.398
When methane built up, or carbon dioxide built up,

00:09:08.398 --> 00:09:12.584
or oxygen was diminished, the birds would swoon

00:09:12.584 --> 00:09:14.910
before people would -- so it acted as an early warning system:

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.890
Hey, get out of the mine. Things aren't going so well.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.844
People come to the table, and even these very blunt,

00:09:20.844 --> 00:09:23.834
staged social interactions, and they, and there's just

00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:26.850
numbers going back and forth between the people,

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.049
and they bring enormous sensitivities to it.

00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:31.738
So we realized we could exploit this, and in fact,

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.294
as we've done that, and we've done this now in

00:09:34.294 --> 00:09:36.988
many thousands of people, I think on the order of

00:09:36.988 --> 00:09:39.153
five or six thousand. We actually, to make this

00:09:39.153 --> 00:09:41.377
a biological probe, need bigger numbers than that,

00:09:41.377 --> 00:09:45.051
remarkably so. But anyway,

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:47.055
patterns have emerged, and we've been able to take

00:09:47.055 --> 00:09:50.891
those patterns, convert them into mathematical models,

00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:53.580
and use those mathematical models to gain new insights

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.711
into these exchanges. Okay, so what?

00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:59.024
Well, the so what is, that's a really nice behavioral measure,

00:09:59.024 --> 00:10:02.343
the economic games bring to us notions of optimal play.

00:10:02.343 --> 00:10:04.827
We can compute that during the game.

00:10:04.827 --> 00:10:07.780
And we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.110
Here's the cool thing. Six or seven years ago,

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.660
we developed a team. It was at the time in Houston, Texas.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.054
It's now in Virginia and London. And we built software

00:10:18.054 --> 00:10:21.261
that'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices

00:10:21.261 --> 00:10:25.296
up over the Internet. I guess we've done up to six machines

00:10:25.296 --> 00:10:27.277
at a time, but let's just focus on two.

00:10:27.277 --> 00:10:30.335
So it synchronizes machines anywhere in the world.

00:10:30.335 --> 00:10:33.504
We synchronize the machines, set them into these

00:10:33.504 --> 00:10:35.487
staged social interactions, and we eavesdrop on both

00:10:35.487 --> 00:10:37.153
of the interacting brains. So for the first time,

00:10:37.153 --> 00:10:40.760
we don't have to look at just averages over single individuals,

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.657
or have individuals playing computers, or try to make

00:10:43.657 --> 00:10:46.420
inferences that way. We can study individual dyads.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.205
We can study the way that one person interacts with another person,

00:10:49.205 --> 00:10:51.769
turn the numbers up, and start to gain new insights

00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:54.284
into the boundaries of normal cognition,

00:10:54.284 --> 00:10:57.016
but more importantly, we can put people with

00:10:57.016 --> 00:11:00.353
classically defined mental illnesses, or brain damage,

00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:03.904
into these social interactions, and use these as probes of that.

00:11:03.904 --> 00:11:06.254
So we've started this effort. We've made a few hits,

00:11:06.254 --> 00:11:08.703
a few, I think, embryonic discoveries.

00:11:08.703 --> 00:11:11.515
We think there's a future to this. But it's our way

00:11:11.515 --> 00:11:14.075
of going in and redefining, with a new lexicon,

00:11:14.075 --> 00:11:18.097
a mathematical one actually, as opposed to the standard

00:11:18.097 --> 00:11:20.675
ways that we think about mental illness,

00:11:20.675 --> 00:11:22.742
characterizing these diseases, by using the people

00:11:22.742 --> 00:11:25.749
as birds in the exchanges. That is, we exploit the fact

00:11:25.749 --> 00:11:29.993
that the healthy partner, playing somebody with major depression,

00:11:29.993 --> 00:11:32.903
or playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder,

00:11:32.903 --> 00:11:36.753
or playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

00:11:36.753 --> 00:11:39.972
we use that as a kind of biosensor, and then we use

00:11:39.972 --> 00:11:42.616
computer programs to model that person, and it gives us

00:11:42.616 --> 00:11:45.086
a kind of assay of this.

00:11:45.086 --> 00:11:47.217
Early days, and we're just beginning, we're setting up sites

00:11:47.217 --> 00:11:50.627
around the world. Here are a few of our collaborating sites.

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.936
The hub, ironically enough,

00:11:52.936 --> 00:11:55.825
is centered in little Roanoke, Virginia.

00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:58.094
There's another hub in London, now, and the rest

00:11:58.094 --> 00:12:02.103
are getting set up. We hope to give the data away

00:12:02.103 --> 00:12:05.776
at some stage. That's a complicated issue

00:12:05.776 --> 00:12:08.770
about making it available to the rest of the world.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.617
But we're also studying just a small part

00:12:10.617 --> 00:12:12.884
of what makes us interesting as human beings, and so

00:12:12.884 --> 00:12:14.925
I would invite other people who are interested in this

00:12:14.925 --> 00:12:17.494
to ask us for the software, or even for guidance

00:12:17.494 --> 00:12:19.713
on how to move forward with that.

00:12:19.713 --> 00:12:22.054
Let me leave you with one thought in closing.

00:12:22.054 --> 00:12:23.996
The interesting thing about studying cognition

00:12:23.996 --> 00:12:27.728
has been that we've been limited, in a way.

00:12:27.728 --> 00:12:30.671
We just haven't had the tools to look at interacting brains

00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:31.871
simultaneously.

00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:34.341
The fact is, though, that even when we're alone,

00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:38.452
we're a profoundly social creature. We're not a solitary mind

00:12:38.452 --> 00:12:42.825
built out of properties that kept it alive in the world

00:12:42.825 --> 00:12:46.773
independent of other people. In fact, our minds

00:12:46.773 --> 00:12:49.643
depend on other people. They depend on other people,

00:12:49.643 --> 00:12:51.184
and they're expressed in other people,

00:12:51.184 --> 00:12:54.836
so the notion of who you are, you often don't know

00:12:54.836 --> 00:12:57.524
who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people

00:12:57.524 --> 00:12:59.930
that are close to you, people that are enemies of you,

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.475
people that are agnostic to you.

00:13:02.475 --> 00:13:06.251
So this is the first sort of step into using that insight

00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:09.546
into what makes us human beings, turning it into a tool,

00:13:09.546 --> 00:13:11.524
and trying to gain new insights into mental illness.

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:14.645
Thanks for having me. (Applause)

00:13:14.645 --> 00:13:17.734
