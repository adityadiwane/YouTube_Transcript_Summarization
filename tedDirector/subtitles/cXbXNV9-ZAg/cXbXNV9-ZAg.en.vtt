00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:15.452
There's this fact that I love
that I read somewhere once,

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:20.126
that one of the things that's contributed
to homo sapiens' success

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.493
as a species

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:23.573
is our lack of body hair --

00:00:23.597 --> 00:00:26.021
that our hairlessness, our nakedness

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:28.351
combined with our invention of clothing,

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:31.669
gives us the ability to modulate
our body temperature

00:00:31.693 --> 00:00:35.289
and thus be able to survive
in any climate we choose.

00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:39.322
And now we've evolved to the point
where we can't survive without clothing.

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:40.876
And it's more than just utility,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.221
now it's a communication.

00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:45.053
Everything that we choose
to put on is a narrative,

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:47.098
a story about where we've been,

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:48.714
what we're doing,

00:00:48.738 --> 00:00:49.938
who we want to be.

00:00:51.048 --> 00:00:52.796
I was a lonely kid.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.652
I didn't have an easy time
finding friends to play with,

00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:58.071
and I ended up making
a lot of my own play.

00:00:58.423 --> 00:01:00.902
I made a lot of my own toys.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:02.565
It began with ice cream.

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.713
There was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown,

00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:08.089
and they served ice cream
from behind the counter

00:01:08.113 --> 00:01:10.720
in these giant, five-gallon,
cardboard tubs.

00:01:10.744 --> 00:01:13.006
And someone told me --
I was eight years old --

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.730
someone told me that when
they were done with those tubs,

00:01:15.754 --> 00:01:17.968
they washed them out
and kept them in the back,

00:01:17.992 --> 00:01:19.946
and if you asked they would give you one.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.404
It took me a couple of weeks
to work up the courage,

00:01:22.428 --> 00:01:23.579
but I did, and they did.

00:01:23.603 --> 00:01:26.916
They gave me one -- I went home
with this beautiful cardboard tub.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.336
I was trying to figure out what
I could do with this exotic material --

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.745
metal ring, top and bottom.

00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:35.154
I started turning it over in my head,
and I realized, "Wait a minute --

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:37.320
my head actually fits inside this thing."

00:01:37.344 --> 00:01:38.907
(Laughter)

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:40.624
Yeah, I cut a hole out,

00:01:40.648 --> 00:01:42.167
I put some acetate in there

00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:43.905
and I made myself a space helmet.

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.082
(Laughter)

00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:48.066
I needed a place to wear the space helmet,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.794
so I found a refrigerator box
a couple blocks from home.

00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:52.105
I pushed it home,

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:54.897
and in my parents' guest room closet,

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:57.312
I turned it into a spaceship.

00:01:57.336 --> 00:01:59.635
I started with a control panel
out of cardboard.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.457
I cut a hole for a radar screen

00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:03.704
and put a flashlight
underneath it to light it.

00:02:03.728 --> 00:02:06.778
I put a view screen up,
which I offset off the back wall --

00:02:06.802 --> 00:02:09.435
and this is where I thought
I was being really clever --

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.506
without permission, I painted
the back wall of the closet black

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.689
and put a star field,

00:02:13.713 --> 00:02:18.243
which I lit up with some Christmas lights
I found in the attic,

00:02:18.267 --> 00:02:20.204
and I went on some space missions.

00:02:21.214 --> 00:02:22.365
A couple years later,

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:23.791
the movie "Jaws" came out.

00:02:23.815 --> 00:02:27.061
I was way too young to see it,
but I was caught up in "Jaws" fever,

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:29.247
like everyone else in America at the time.

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.161
There was a store in my town
that had a "Jaws" costume in their window,

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.753
and my mom must have overheard
me talking to someone

00:02:35.777 --> 00:02:37.897
about how awesome
I thought this costume was,

00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:39.779
because a couple days before Halloween,

00:02:39.803 --> 00:02:43.938
she blew my freaking mind
by giving me this "Jaws" costume.

00:02:44.365 --> 00:02:46.765
Now, I recognize it's a bit of a trope

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:48.662
for people of a certain age to complain

00:02:48.686 --> 00:02:52.222
that kids these days have no idea
how good they have it,

00:02:52.246 --> 00:02:54.291
but let me just show you a random sampling

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:58.013
of entry-level kids' costumes
you can buy online right now ...

00:02:58.037 --> 00:03:01.859
... and this is the "Jaws" costume
my mom bought for me.

00:03:01.883 --> 00:03:04.615
(Laughter)

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.890
This is a paper-thin shark face

00:03:07.914 --> 00:03:11.452
and a vinyl bib with the poster
of "Jaws" on it.

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:12.524
(Laughter)

00:03:12.548 --> 00:03:13.951
And I loved it.

00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:15.802
A couple years later,

00:03:15.826 --> 00:03:18.643
my dad took me to a film
called "Excalibur."

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:20.709
I actually got him to take me to it twice,

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:25.000
which is no small thing,
because it is a hard, R-rated film.

00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:27.180
But it wasn't the blood
and guts or the boobs

00:03:27.204 --> 00:03:29.101
that made me want to go see it again.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.283
They helped --

00:03:30.307 --> 00:03:31.309
(Laughter)

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:32.498
It was the armor.

00:03:32.522 --> 00:03:36.636
The armor in "Excalibur"
was intoxicatingly beautiful to me.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.277
These were literally knights
in shining, mirror-polished armor.

00:03:41.301 --> 00:03:45.478
And moreover, the knights in "Excalibur"
wear their armor everywhere.

00:03:45.502 --> 00:03:49.025
All the time -- they wear it at dinner,
they wear it to bed.

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.100
(Laughter)

00:03:50.124 --> 00:03:51.994
I was like, "Are they reading my mind?

00:03:52.018 --> 00:03:54.486
I want to wear armor all the time!"

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.525
(Laughter)

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.748
So I went back to my favorite material,

00:03:57.772 --> 00:03:59.321
the gateway drug for making,

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:00.765
corrugated cardboard,

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:03.651
and I made myself a suit of armor,

00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:07.120
replete with the neck shields
and a white horse.

00:04:07.144 --> 00:04:08.410
Now that I've oversold it,

00:04:08.434 --> 00:04:10.460
here's a picture of the armor that I made.

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:11.825
(Laughter)

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.299
(Applause)

00:04:16.736 --> 00:04:19.327
Now, this is only the first
suit of armor I made

00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:20.695
inspired by "Excalibur."

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:21.972
A couple of years later,

00:04:21.996 --> 00:04:26.094
I convinced my dad to embark
on making me a proper suit of armor.

00:04:26.118 --> 00:04:27.763
Over about a month,

00:04:27.787 --> 00:04:32.081
he graduated me from cardboard
to roofing aluminum called flashing

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.921
and still, one of my all-time favorite
attachment materials,

00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:36.112
POP rivets.

00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:37.848
We carefully, over that month,

00:04:37.872 --> 00:04:40.446
constructed an articulated suit
of aluminum armor

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.631
with compound curves.

00:04:41.655 --> 00:04:44.560
We drilled holes in the helmet
so that I could breathe,

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:47.631
and I finished just in time
for Halloween and wore it to school.

00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:49.809
Now, this is the one thing in this talk

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:51.650
that I don't have a slide to show you,

00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:53.676
because no photo exists of this armor.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.063
I did wear it to school,

00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:57.691
there was a yearbook photographer
patrolling the halls,

00:04:57.715 --> 00:05:01.105
but he never found me, for reasons
that are about to become clear.

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.207
There were things I didn't anticipate

00:05:03.231 --> 00:05:07.602
about wearing a complete suit
of aluminum armor to school.

00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:10.822
In third period math,
I was standing in the back of class,

00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:12.647
and I'm standing in the back of class

00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:14.867
because the armor did not
allow me to sit down.

00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:16.346
(Laughter)

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.820
This is the first thing
I didn't anticipate.

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:21.866
And then my teacher looks at me
sort of concerned

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.882
about halfway through the class
and says, "Are you feeling OK?"

00:05:24.906 --> 00:05:27.152
I'm thinking, "Are you kidding?
Am I feeling OK?

00:05:27.176 --> 00:05:30.044
I'm wearing a suit of armor!
I am having the time of my --"

00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:32.728
And I'm just about to tell her
how great I feel,

00:05:32.752 --> 00:05:35.145
when the classroom
starts to list to the left

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.886
and disappear down this long tunnel,

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.482
and then I woke up in the nurse's office.

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:45.269
I had passed out from heat exhaustion,

00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:46.719
wearing the armor.

00:05:46.743 --> 00:05:47.894
And when I woke up,

00:05:47.918 --> 00:05:51.063
I wasn't embarrassed about having
passed out in front of my class,

00:05:51.087 --> 00:05:53.686
I was wondering, "Who took my armor?
Where's my armor?"

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.900
OK, fast-forward a whole bunch of years,

00:05:55.924 --> 00:05:59.258
some colleagues and I get hired
to make a show for Discovery Channel,

00:05:59.282 --> 00:06:00.433
called "MythBusters."

00:06:00.457 --> 00:06:01.623
And over 14 years,

00:06:01.647 --> 00:06:04.821
I learn on the job how to build
experimental methodologies

00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:07.424
and how to tell stories
about them for television.

00:06:07.796 --> 00:06:09.499
I also learn early on

00:06:09.523 --> 00:06:12.382
that costuming can play a key role
in this storytelling.

00:06:12.406 --> 00:06:16.441
I use costumes to add humor, comedy, color

00:06:16.465 --> 00:06:19.488
and narrative clarity
to the stories we're telling.

00:06:19.935 --> 00:06:22.694
And then we do an episode
called "Dumpster Diving,"

00:06:22.718 --> 00:06:24.985
and I learn a little bit more

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.440
about the deeper implications
of what costuming means to me.

00:06:28.464 --> 00:06:30.060
In the episode "Dumpster Diving,"

00:06:30.084 --> 00:06:32.039
the question we were trying to answer is:

00:06:32.063 --> 00:06:33.706
Is jumping into a dumpster as safe

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.706
as the movies would lead you to believe?

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.504
(Laughter)

00:06:37.528 --> 00:06:40.163
The episode was going to have
two distinct parts to it.

00:06:40.187 --> 00:06:43.242
One was where we get trained
to jump off buildings by a stuntman

00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:44.599
into an air bag.

00:06:44.623 --> 00:06:47.104
And the second was the graduation
to the experiment:

00:06:47.128 --> 00:06:49.973
we'd fill a dumpster full of material
and we'd jump into it.

00:06:49.997 --> 00:06:52.284
I wanted to visually separate
these two elements,

00:06:52.308 --> 00:06:53.465
and I thought,

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:57.173
"Well, for the first part we're training,
so we should wear sweatsuits --

00:06:57.197 --> 00:07:00.945
Oh! Let's put 'Stunt Trainee'
on the back of the sweatsuits.

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:02.313
That's for the training."

00:07:02.337 --> 00:07:05.702
But for the second part, I wanted
something really visually striking --

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:08.204
"I know! I'll dress as Neo
from 'The Matrix.'"

00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:09.302
(Laughter)

00:07:09.326 --> 00:07:10.636
So I went to Haight Street.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.239
I bought some beautiful
knee-high, buckle boots.

00:07:13.263 --> 00:07:15.705
I found a long, flowing coat on eBay.

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:19.450
I got sunglasses, which I had to wear
contact lenses in order to wear.

00:07:19.474 --> 00:07:21.454
The day of the experiment shoot comes up,

00:07:21.478 --> 00:07:23.446
and I step out of my car in this costume,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.120
and my crew takes a look at me ...

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.399
and start suppressing
their church giggles.

00:07:28.893 --> 00:07:31.987
They're like,
"(Laugh sound)."

00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:34.442
And I feel two distinct things
at this moment.

00:07:34.466 --> 00:07:36.163
I feel total embarrassment

00:07:36.187 --> 00:07:38.933
over the fact that
it's so nakedly clear to my crew

00:07:38.957 --> 00:07:41.599
that I'm completely
into wearing this costume.

00:07:41.623 --> 00:07:42.773
(Laughter)

00:07:43.328 --> 00:07:46.548
But the producer in my mind reminds myself

00:07:46.572 --> 00:07:48.999
that in the high-speed shot in slow-mo,

00:07:49.023 --> 00:07:52.116
that flowing coat is going to look
beautiful behind me.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.290
(Laughter)

00:07:54.012 --> 00:07:55.883
Five years into the "MythBusters" run,

00:07:55.907 --> 00:07:58.563
we got invited to appear
at San Diego Comic-Con.

00:07:58.587 --> 00:08:01.983
I'd known about Comic-Con for years
and never had time to go.

00:08:02.007 --> 00:08:05.611
This was the big leagues --
this was costuming mecca.

00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:07.675
People fly in from all over the world

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:10.821
to show their amazing creations
on the floor in San Diego.

00:08:10.845 --> 00:08:12.370
And I wanted to participate.

00:08:12.394 --> 00:08:15.456
I decided that I would put together
an elaborate costume

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.914
that covered me completely,

00:08:16.938 --> 00:08:20.557
and I would walk the floor
of San Diego Comic-Con anonymously.

00:08:20.581 --> 00:08:21.899
The costume I chose?

00:08:21.923 --> 00:08:23.073
Hellboy.

00:08:23.493 --> 00:08:24.644
That's not my costume,

00:08:24.668 --> 00:08:25.819
that's actually Hellboy.

00:08:25.843 --> 00:08:26.862
(Laughter)

00:08:26.886 --> 00:08:28.044
But I spent months

00:08:28.068 --> 00:08:30.908
assembling the most screen-accurate
Hellboy costume I could,

00:08:30.932 --> 00:08:32.867
from the boots to the belt to the pants

00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:34.279
to the right hand of doom.

00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:37.694
I found a guy who made
a prosthetic Hellboy head and chest

00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:39.007
and I put them on.

00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:42.762
I even had contact lenses made
in my prescription.

00:08:42.786 --> 00:08:45.116
I wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.769
and I can't even tell you
how balls hot it was in that costume.

00:08:49.793 --> 00:08:50.833
(Laughter)

00:08:50.857 --> 00:08:52.892
Sweating! I should've remembered this.

00:08:52.916 --> 00:08:55.805
I'm sweating buckets
and the contact lenses hurt my eyes,

00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:59.378
and none of it matters
because I'm totally in love.

00:08:59.402 --> 00:09:00.552
(Laughter)

00:09:01.066 --> 00:09:04.629
Not just with the process of putting
on this costume and walking the floor,

00:09:04.653 --> 00:09:08.232
but also with the community
of other costumers.

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.152
It's not called costuming at Cons,

00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:12.002
it's called "cosplay."

00:09:12.026 --> 00:09:14.550
Now ostensibly, cosplay means
people who dress up

00:09:14.574 --> 00:09:17.137
as their favorite characters
from film and television

00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:18.345
and especially anime,

00:09:18.369 --> 00:09:21.110
but it is so much more than that.

00:09:21.134 --> 00:09:24.195
These aren't just people
who find a costume and put it on --

00:09:24.219 --> 00:09:25.616
they mash them up.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.100
They bend them to their will.

00:09:27.124 --> 00:09:30.916
They change them to be the characters
they want to be in those productions.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.856
They're super clever and genius.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.543
They let their freak flag fly
and it's beautiful.

00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:36.606
(Laughter)

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.781
But more than that,

00:09:37.805 --> 00:09:39.258
they rehearse their costumes.

00:09:39.282 --> 00:09:40.758
At Comic-Con or any other Con,

00:09:40.782 --> 00:09:43.329
you don't just take pictures
of people walking around.

00:09:43.353 --> 00:09:44.508
You go up and say,

00:09:44.532 --> 00:09:46.984
"Hey, I like your costume,
can I take your picture?"

00:09:47.008 --> 00:09:49.804
And then you give them time
to get into their pose.

00:09:49.828 --> 00:09:51.498
They've worked hard on their pose

00:09:51.522 --> 00:09:54.142
to make their costume look
great for your camera.

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:56.656
And it's so beautiful to watch.

00:09:57.178 --> 00:09:58.609
And I take this to heart.

00:09:58.633 --> 00:10:00.139
At subsequent Cons,

00:10:00.163 --> 00:10:04.556
I learn Heath Ledger's shambling walk
as the Joker from "The Dark Knight."

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.630
I learn how to be a scary Ringwraith
from "Lord of the Rings,"

00:10:07.654 --> 00:10:09.715
and I actually frighten some children.

00:10:09.739 --> 00:10:11.639
I learned that "hrr hrr hrr" --

00:10:11.663 --> 00:10:13.800
that head laugh that Chewbacca does.

00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:17.599
And then I dressed up as
No-Face from "Spirited Away."

00:10:17.623 --> 00:10:21.074
If you don't know about "Spirited Away"
and its director, Hayao Miyazaki,

00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:22.549
first of all, you're welcome.

00:10:22.573 --> 00:10:23.723
(Laughter)

00:10:24.136 --> 00:10:27.576
This is a masterpiece,
and one of my all-time favorite films.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.943
It's about a young girl named Chihiro
who gets lost in the spirit world

00:10:31.967 --> 00:10:34.300
in an abandoned Japanese theme park.

00:10:34.324 --> 00:10:36.220
And she finds her way back out again

00:10:36.244 --> 00:10:38.560
with the help of a couple
of friends she makes --

00:10:38.584 --> 00:10:40.074
a captured dragon named Haku

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:42.362
and a lonely demon named No-Face.

00:10:42.386 --> 00:10:45.256
No-Face is lonely
and he wants to make friends,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.445
and he thinks the way to do it
is by luring them to him

00:10:48.469 --> 00:10:50.539
and producing gold in his hand.

00:10:50.563 --> 00:10:52.314
But this doesn't go very well,

00:10:52.338 --> 00:10:55.155
and so he ends up going
on kind of a rampage

00:10:55.179 --> 00:10:57.435
until Chihiro saves him,

00:10:57.459 --> 00:10:58.648
rescues him.

00:10:59.081 --> 00:11:01.616
So I put together a No-Face costume,

00:11:02.731 --> 00:11:04.988
and I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con.

00:11:05.012 --> 00:11:09.733
And I very carefully practiced
No-Face's gestures.

00:11:09.757 --> 00:11:13.371
I resolved I would not speak
in this costume at all.

00:11:13.395 --> 00:11:15.434
When people asked to take my picture,

00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:17.083
I would nod

00:11:17.107 --> 00:11:19.528
and I would shyly stand next to them.

00:11:19.552 --> 00:11:21.218
They would take the picture

00:11:21.242 --> 00:11:23.956
and then I would secret out
from behind my robe

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.502
a chocolate gold coin.

00:11:25.526 --> 00:11:28.894
And at the end of the photo process,
I'd make it appear for them.

00:11:28.918 --> 00:11:31.627
Ah, ah ah! -- like that.

00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:33.034
And people were freaking out.

00:11:33.058 --> 00:11:36.091
"Holy crap! Gold from No-Face!
Oh my god, this is so cool!"

00:11:36.115 --> 00:11:39.505
And I'm feeling and I'm walking
the floor and it's fantastic.

00:11:40.006 --> 00:11:42.783
And about 15 minutes in something happens.

00:11:43.368 --> 00:11:45.394
Somebody grabs my hand,

00:11:46.014 --> 00:11:48.092
and they put a coin back into it.

00:11:48.116 --> 00:11:51.312
And I think maybe they're giving me
a coin as a return gift,

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:53.869
but no, this is one of the coins
that I'd given away.

00:11:54.229 --> 00:11:55.680
I don't know why.

00:11:55.704 --> 00:11:57.952
And I keep on going,
I take some more pictures.

00:11:57.976 --> 00:11:59.427
And then it happens again.

00:11:59.939 --> 00:12:03.150
Understand, I can't see anything
inside this costume.

00:12:03.174 --> 00:12:04.661
I can see through the mouth --

00:12:04.685 --> 00:12:06.304
I can see people's shoes.

00:12:06.328 --> 00:12:09.143
I can hear what they're saying
and I can see their feet.

00:12:09.167 --> 00:12:11.437
But the third time someone
gives me back a coin,

00:12:11.461 --> 00:12:13.119
I want to know what's going on.

00:12:13.612 --> 00:12:16.671
So I sort of tilt my head back
to get a better view,

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:20.009
and what I see is someone walking
away from me going like this.

00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:23.773
And then it hits me:

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.233
it's bad luck to take gold from No-Face.

00:12:28.257 --> 00:12:30.169
In the film "Spirited Away,"

00:12:30.193 --> 00:12:33.590
bad luck befalls those
who take gold from No-Face.

00:12:34.351 --> 00:12:40.609
This isn't a performer-audience
relationship; this is cosplay.

00:12:41.855 --> 00:12:44.068
We are, all of us on that floor,

00:12:44.092 --> 00:12:47.425
injecting ourselves into a narrative
that meant something to us.

00:12:47.763 --> 00:12:49.608
And we're making it our own.

00:12:49.632 --> 00:12:53.732
We're connecting with something
important inside of us.

00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:58.092
And the costumes
are how we reveal ourselves

00:12:58.116 --> 00:12:59.299
to each other.

00:12:59.984 --> 00:13:01.140
Thank you.

00:13:01.164 --> 00:13:06.594
(Applause)
