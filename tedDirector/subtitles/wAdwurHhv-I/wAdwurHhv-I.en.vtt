00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
And usually when I tell people I'm an artist,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
they just look at me and say, "Do you paint?"

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
or "What kind of medium do you work in?"

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Well most of my work that I work with

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
is really a little bit about methodologies of working

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
rather than actually a specific discipline

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
or a specific technique.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
So let me show you a little of that.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
So it started over here.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And as I was coming back,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
and went into a little room

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and he asked me all sorts of questions --

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
"Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Why were you there? Who pays for your trips?" --

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
all these little details.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And then literally just out of nowhere,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
the guy asks me, "Where were you September 12th?"

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And when most of us get asked, "Where were you September 12th?"

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
or any date for that fact,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
it's like, "I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you."

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
So I pulled out my little PDA,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
and I said, "Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th."

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
I had September 12th -- from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., I paid my storage bill.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
From 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., I taught my intro class,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., I taught my advanced class.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
"Where were you the 11th?" "Where were you the 10th?"

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
"Where were you the 29th? the 30th?"

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
"Where were you October 5th?"

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
We read about six months of my calendar.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
of what I did.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
But good thing I did,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
because I don't look good in orange.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
(Laughter)

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
So he asked me --

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
(Applause)

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
"So this storage unit that you paid the rent on,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
what did you have in it?"

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
This was in Tampa, Florida,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
so I was like, "Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Just assorted garage sale junk,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
because I'm a pack rat."

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And he looks at me really confused and says, "No explosives?"

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
(Laughter)

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
I was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And if there were, I would have remembered that one."

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And he's still a little confused,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And so we're sitting there,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
he says, "Okay, I have enough information here.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
They'll follow up with you, and we'll take care of it."

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
I was like, "Great."

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
So I got home and the phone rings,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and a man introduced himself.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
where I spent six months of my life --

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
back and forth, not six months continuously.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
By the way, you folks know that in the United States,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
you can't take photographs of federal buildings,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
but Google can do it for you.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
So to the folks from Google, thank you.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
(Applause)

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
So I spent a lot of time in this building.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Questions like:

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
"Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.260
that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?"

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
when you're doing this.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
You're basically face-to-face with someone

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
that essentially decides life or death.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Or questions such as -- actually, during the polygraph,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them --

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
one of the polygraph questions was ...

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
well the first one was, "Is your name Hasan?" "Yes."

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
"Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes."

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
Because you have to base it on a yes or no.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Then, of course, the next question is:

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
"Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
I work at a university.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
(Laughter)

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.260
So I was like, "Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly."

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
But they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
I was like, "No."

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
So at the end of six months of this

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and nine consecutive polygraphs,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
they said, "Hey, everything's fine."

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
I was like, "I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
I know everything's fine."

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
So they're looking at me really odd.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And it's like, "Guys, I travel a lot."

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
This is with the FBI.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
And I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
and here we go all over again."

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And there was a sincere concern there.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
And he was like, "You know, if you get into trouble,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
give us a call -- we'll take care of it."

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
I would tell them, "Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
on March 12th" or whatever.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
A couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
It wasn't that I had to, but I chose to.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Just wanted to say, "Hey guys.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves."

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
(Laughter)

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
"I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Just letting you know. Heads up."

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And then the phone calls turned into emails,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
and the emails got longer and longer and longer ...

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
with pictures,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
with travel tips.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Then I'd make websites.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
So I actually designed this back in 2003.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
So this kind of tracks me at any given moment.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
I wrote some code for my mobile phone.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
But I'll watch myself. It's okay.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
You don't have to waste your energy or your resources.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And I'll help you out.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me?

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Well they probably have all my flight records,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.260
so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
So you can see, Delta 1252

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
going from Kansas City to Atlanta.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
This was on Delta 719

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.260
going from JFK to San Francisco.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
See that? They won't let me on a plane with that,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
but they'll give it to me on the plane.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
(Laughter)

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
These are the airports that I hang out in,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
because I like airports.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
That's Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
This is in Warsaw.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Singapore. You can see, they're kind of empty.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
These images are shot really anonymously

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
to the point where it could be anyone.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and putting it all together.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And when you're in a situation

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
where you have to justify every moment of your existence,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
At the time that this was going on,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
the last thing on my mind was "art project."

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened?

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
And after piecing together this, this and this,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
eventually evolved into this,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and it actually became this project.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them --

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
because they need to know.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
This is me buying some duck flavored paste

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
at the Ranch 99 in Daly City

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
on Sunday, November 15th.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
At Coreana Supermarket

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
buying my kimchi because I like kimchi.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
And I bought some crabs too right around there,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland --

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
East Oakland, sorry.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And then my pickled jellyfish

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Now if you go to my bank records,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
it'll actually show something from there,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
so you know that, on May 9th,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.260
So not only that I'm giving this information here and there,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
but now there's a third party,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
an independent third party, my bank,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
that's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
So there's points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And there's a verification taking place.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Sometimes they're really small purchases.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
and everything pops up right away.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Sometimes there's a lot of information.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.260
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
And then sometimes you get this.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
January 22nd.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
And I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
because this is what I had to do with the FBI.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
I had to tell them every little detail of everything.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
I spend a lot of time on the road.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
This is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
off of Route 80

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
at 8:01 p.m. on August 19th.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
So there's multiple databases.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
There's actually 46,000 images right now on my site,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
and the FBI has seen all of them --

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
at least I trust they've seen all of them.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
And then sometimes you don't get much information at all,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
you just get this empty bed.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
So you get something like this.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
This, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California --

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Vietnamese sandwich.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
So there's different categorizations

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
of meals eaten outside

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
empty train stations, empty gas stations.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home?

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
So again, you have to do some detective work here.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
So sometimes the databases get so specific.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
near a train station

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
on July fifth to July sixth.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
At 11:39 a.m. was this one.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
At 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
So I time-stamp my life every few moments.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Every few moments I shoot the image.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
Now it's all done on my iPhone,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
and it all goes straight up to my server,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
and my server does all the backend work

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
and categorizes things and puts everything together.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
They need to know where I'm doing my business,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
because they want to know about my business.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
So on December 4th, I went here.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
And on Sunday, June 14th at 2009 --

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
in Skowhegan, Maine -- this was my apartment there.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
So what you're basically seeing here

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
is all bits and pieces and all this information.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
If you go to my site, there's tons of things.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
And really, it's not the most user-friendly interface.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.260
It's actually quite user-unfriendly.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
And one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
is that everything is there,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
but you have to really work through it.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.260
So by me putting all this information out there,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
But in this barrage of noise

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
that I'm putting out,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.260
I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And you know very little about me actually.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And really so I've come to the conclusion

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
that the way you protect your privacy,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
particularly in an era where everything is cataloged

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and everything is archived and everything is recorded,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
there's no need to delete information anymore.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
So what do you do when everything is out there?

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
Well you have to take control over it.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
And if I give you this information directly,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
it's a very different type of identity

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
is the fact that intelligence agencies --

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and it doesn't matter who they are --

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
they all operate in an industry

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
where their commodity is information,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
or restricted access to information.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
And the reason their information has any value

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
is, well, because no one else has access to it.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
And by me cutting out the middle man

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
and giving it straight to you,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
the information that the FBI has has no value,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
so thus devaluing their currency.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
And I understand that, on an individual level,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
it's purely symbolic.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
But if 300 million people in the U.S.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
started doing this,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
from the ground up.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
And we're getting to that.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
When I first started this project,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
people were looking at me and saying,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
"Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at?

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
Why are you posting these photos?"

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.260
This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
and 750 million people

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
were posting status messages

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
or poking people.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
because you're all doing it.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
whether we're aware of it or not.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
So we're creating our own archives and so on.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
And you know, some of my friends have always said,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
"Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this?

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
Because no one's really watching.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
No one's really going to bother you."

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
So one of the things that I do

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
is I actually look through my server logs very carefully.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
Because it's about surveillance.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
I'm watching who's watching me.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
And I came up with these.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
So these are some of my sample logs.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by --

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
Department of Homeland Security.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.260
I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Central Intelligence Agency.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Executive Office of the President.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
Not really sure why they show up, but they do.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
I think they kind of like to look at art.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.260
And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
So thank you very much. I appreciate it.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:32.260
(Applause)

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Bruno Giussani: Hasan, just curious.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
You said, "Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone,"

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
but actually you do take the pictures and put on information.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
So how many hours of the day does that take?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
HE: Almost none.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
It's no different

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
than sending a text.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
It's no different than checking an email.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
It's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
So it's just become another day.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
I mean, when we update a status message,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
we don't really think about how long that's going to take.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
send, and then it's done.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
And everything's automated at the other end.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
BG: On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy?

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
HE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
So it holds onto the very last point.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
So if I'm on a 12-hour flight,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
you'll see the last airport that I departed from.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
BG: Hasan, thank you very much. (HE: Thank you.)

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
(Applause)
