00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:15.340
Today I'm here, actually,
to pose you a question.

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:17.026
What is life?

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.223
It has been really puzzling me
for more than 25 years,

00:00:21.247 --> 00:00:24.829
and will probably continue doing so
for the next 25 years.

00:00:25.594 --> 00:00:30.165
This is the thesis I did
when I was still in undergraduate school.

00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:38.197
While my colleagues still treated
computers as big calculators,

00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.522
I started to teach computers to learn.

00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:44.764
I built digital lady beetles

00:00:44.788 --> 00:00:49.375
and tried to learn from real lady beetles,
just to do one thing:

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:50.549
search for food.

00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:53.915
And after very simple neural network --

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:56.210
genetic algorithms and so on --

00:00:56.234 --> 00:00:57.591
look at the pattern.

00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:00.637
They're almost identical to real life.

00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:05.685
A very striking learning experience
for a twenty-year-old.

00:01:07.423 --> 00:01:10.330
Life is a learning program.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.612
When you look
at all of this wonderful world,

00:01:15.636 --> 00:01:18.828
every species has
its own learning program.

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:22.166
The learning program is genome,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.794
and the code of that program is DNA.

00:01:26.977 --> 00:01:32.954
The different genomes of each species
represent different survival strategies.

00:01:33.438 --> 00:01:37.652
They represent hundreds of millions
of years of evolution.

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:42.491
The interaction between
every species' ancestor

00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:44.485
and the environment.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.409
I was really fascinated about the world,

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:49.615
about the DNA,

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:52.582
about, you know, the language of life,

00:01:52.606 --> 00:01:54.252
the program of learning.

00:01:54.587 --> 00:01:59.320
So I decided to co-found
the institute to read them.

00:01:59.344 --> 00:02:00.706
I read many of them.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.538
We probably read more than half
of the prior animal genomes in the world.

00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:07.539
I mean, up to date.

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:10.498
We did learn a lot.

00:02:11.117 --> 00:02:14.985
We did sequence, also,
one species many, many times ...

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.168
human genome.

00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:17.954
We sequenced the first Asian.

00:02:17.978 --> 00:02:20.816
I sequenced it myself many, many times,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.399
just to take advantage of that platform.

00:02:24.788 --> 00:02:27.694
Look at all those repeating base pairs:

00:02:27.718 --> 00:02:29.186
ATCG.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.124
You don't understand anything there.

00:02:31.148 --> 00:02:32.742
But look at that one base pair.

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:35.289
Those five letters, the AGGAA.

00:02:35.704 --> 00:02:39.181
These five SNPs represent
a very specific haplotype

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:41.046
in the Tibetan population

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.069
around the gene called EPAS1.

00:02:43.093 --> 00:02:44.824
That gene has been proved --

00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:46.111
it's highly selective --

00:02:46.135 --> 00:02:50.482
it's the most significant signature
of positive selection of Tibetans

00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:52.188
for the higher altitude adaptation.

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:54.136
You know what?

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.947
These five SNPs were the result
of integration of Denisovans,

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:03.223
or Denisovan-like individuals into humans.

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.580
This is the reason
why we need to read those genomes.

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:07.985
To understand history,

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:12.107
to understand what kind
of learning process

00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.505
the genome has been through
for the millions of years.

00:03:17.318 --> 00:03:20.241
By reading a genome,
it can give you a lot of information --

00:03:20.265 --> 00:03:21.938
tells you the bugs in the genome --

00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:25.142
I mean, birth defects,
monogenetic disorders.

00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:26.472
Reading a drop of blood

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:28.604
could tell you why you got a fever,

00:03:28.628 --> 00:03:31.732
or it tells you which medicine
and dosage needs to be used

00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:34.477
when you're sick, especially for cancer.

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:38.615
A lot of things could be studied,
but look at that:

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.599
30 years ago, we were still poor in China.

00:03:42.928 --> 00:03:46.590
Only .67 percent of the Chinese
adult population had diabetes.

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:49.150
Look at now: 11 percent.

00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:52.825
Genetics cannot change over 30 years --

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.110
only one generation.

00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:56.352
It must be something different.

00:03:56.376 --> 00:03:57.574
Diet?

00:03:57.598 --> 00:03:58.748
The environment?

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:00.522
Lifestyle?

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:05.461
Even identical twins
could develop totally differently.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.756
It could be one becomes
very obese, the other is not.

00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:13.356
One develops a cancer
and the other does not.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.285
Not mentioning living
in a very stressed environment.

00:04:19.386 --> 00:04:21.981
I moved to Shenzhen 10 years ago ...

00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:24.743
for some reason, people may know.

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.728
If the gene's under stress,

00:04:27.752 --> 00:04:29.419
it behaves totally differently.

00:04:30.683 --> 00:04:32.064
Life is a journey.

00:04:32.637 --> 00:04:35.145
A gene is just a starting point,

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.319
not the end.

00:04:37.106 --> 00:04:41.594
You have this statistical risk
of certain diseases when you are born.

00:04:42.212 --> 00:04:45.775
But every day you make different choices,

00:04:45.799 --> 00:04:50.337
and those choices will increase
or decrease the risk of certain diseases.

00:04:51.248 --> 00:04:53.507
But do you know
where you are on the curve?

00:04:54.263 --> 00:04:56.422
What's the past curve look like?

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.244
What kind of decisions
are you facing every day?

00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:02.048
And what kind of decision is the right one

00:05:02.072 --> 00:05:06.306
to make your own right curve
over your life journey?

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.415
What's that?

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.109
The only thing you cannot change,

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:13.314
you cannot reverse back,

00:05:13.338 --> 00:05:14.566
is time.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.591
Probably not yet; maybe in the future.

00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:17.725
(Laughter)

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.568
Well, you cannot change
the decision you've made,

00:05:20.592 --> 00:05:22.133
but can we do something there?

00:05:22.463 --> 00:05:27.565
Can we actually try to run
multiple options on me,

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:31.148
and try to predict right
on the consequence,

00:05:31.172 --> 00:05:33.355
and be able to make the right choice?

00:05:33.973 --> 00:05:35.145
After all,

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.021
we are our choices.

00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:40.807
These lady beetles came to me afterwards.

00:05:41.462 --> 00:05:44.925
25 years ago, I made
the digital lady beetles

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.733
to try to simulate real lady beetles.

00:05:47.323 --> 00:05:49.108
Can I make a digital me ...

00:05:49.717 --> 00:05:51.041
to simulate me?

00:05:51.775 --> 00:05:54.336
I understand the neural
network could become

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.446
much more sophisticated
and complicated there.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.024
Can I make that one,

00:05:59.048 --> 00:06:02.930
and try to run multiple options
on that digital me --

00:06:02.954 --> 00:06:04.214
to compute that?

00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:07.808
Then I could live in different universes,

00:06:07.832 --> 00:06:10.596
in parallel, at the same time.

00:06:10.968 --> 00:06:13.481
Then I would choose
whatever is good for me.

00:06:14.063 --> 00:06:17.905
I probably have the most comprehensive
digital me on the planet.

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:20.586
I've spent a lot of dollars
on me, on myself.

00:06:21.807 --> 00:06:27.013
And the digital me told me
I have a genetic risk of gout

00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:28.704
by all of those things there.

00:06:29.074 --> 00:06:31.185
You need different technology to do that.

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:32.779
You need the proteins, genes,

00:06:32.803 --> 00:06:35.329
you need metabolized antibodies,

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.845
you need to screen all your body

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:41.493
about the bacterias and viruses
covering you, or in you.

00:06:41.517 --> 00:06:44.305
You need to have
all the smart devices there --

00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:47.745
smart cars, smart house, smart tables,

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:51.098
smart watch, smart phone
to track all of your activities there.

00:06:51.122 --> 00:06:52.599
The environment is important --

00:06:52.623 --> 00:06:53.844
everything's important --

00:06:53.868 --> 00:06:55.614
and don't forget the smart toilet.

00:06:55.638 --> 00:06:56.669
(Laughter)

00:06:56.693 --> 00:06:58.467
It's such a waste, right?

00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:04.176
Every day, so much invaluable information
just has been flushed into the water.

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:05.852
And you need them.

00:07:05.876 --> 00:07:07.400
You need to measure all of them.

00:07:07.424 --> 00:07:10.047
You need to be able to measure
everything around you

00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:11.288
and compute them.

00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:15.816
And the digital me told me
I have a genetic defect.

00:07:16.617 --> 00:07:18.688
I have a very high risk of gout.

00:07:19.688 --> 00:07:21.285
I don't feel anything now,

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:22.681
I'm still healthy.

00:07:22.705 --> 00:07:24.206
But look at my uric acid level.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.045
It's double the normal range.

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:29.560
And the digital me searched
all the medicine books,

00:07:29.584 --> 00:07:33.752
and it tells me, "OK, you could
drink burdock tea" --

00:07:33.776 --> 00:07:35.474
I cannot even pronounce it right --

00:07:35.498 --> 00:07:36.533
(Laughter)

00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:38.371
That is from old Chinese wisdom.

00:07:38.896 --> 00:07:41.655
And I drank that tea for three months.

00:07:41.679 --> 00:07:44.220
My uric acid has now gone back to normal.

00:07:44.938 --> 00:07:46.613
I mean, it worked for me.

00:07:46.637 --> 00:07:49.153
All those thousands of years
of wisdom worked for me.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.327
I was lucky.

00:07:50.684 --> 00:07:54.192
But I'm probably not lucky for you.

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:57.174
All of this existing
knowledge in the world

00:07:57.198 --> 00:08:03.022
cannot possibly be efficient enough
or personalized enough for yourself.

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:06.347
The only way to make
that digital me work ...

00:08:07.244 --> 00:08:09.301
is to learn from yourself.

00:08:10.913 --> 00:08:13.317
You have to ask a lot
of questions about yourself:

00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:15.014
"What if?" --

00:08:15.038 --> 00:08:16.841
I'm being jet-lagged now here.

00:08:16.865 --> 00:08:18.823
You don't probably see it, but I do.

00:08:19.893 --> 00:08:21.685
What if I eat less?

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:24.657
When I took metformin,
supposedly to live longer?

00:08:25.394 --> 00:08:26.741
What if I climb Mt. Everest?

00:08:26.765 --> 00:08:28.067
It's not that easy.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.421
Or run a marathon?

00:08:29.952 --> 00:08:32.266
What if I drink a bottle of mao-tai,

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:33.626
which is a Chinese liquor,

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:34.844
and I get really drunk?

00:08:34.868 --> 00:08:39.297
I was doing a video rehearsal last time
with the folks here,

00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:40.590
when I was drunk,

00:08:40.614 --> 00:08:42.703
and I totally delivered
a different speech.

00:08:42.727 --> 00:08:45.596
(Laughter)

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.921
What if I work less, right?

00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:49.827
I have been less stressed, right?

00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:51.661
So that probably never happened to me,

00:08:51.685 --> 00:08:53.783
I was really stressed every day,

00:08:53.807 --> 00:08:55.773
but I hope I could be less stressed.

00:08:56.111 --> 00:08:58.290
These early studies told us,

00:08:58.314 --> 00:09:00.297
even with the same banana,

00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:03.308
we have totally different
glucose-level reactions

00:09:03.332 --> 00:09:04.718
over different individuals.

00:09:04.742 --> 00:09:05.892
How about me?

00:09:06.236 --> 00:09:08.234
What is the right breakfast for me?

00:09:08.258 --> 00:09:11.176
I need to do two weeks
of controlled experiments,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.945
of testing all kinds of different
food ingredients on me,

00:09:14.969 --> 00:09:17.257
and check my body's reaction.

00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:20.398
And I don't know
the precise nutrition for me,

00:09:20.422 --> 00:09:21.572
for myself.

00:09:23.013 --> 00:09:27.377
Then I wanted to search
all the Chinese old wisdom

00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:30.393
about how I can live longer,
and healthier.

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:31.937
I did it.

00:09:31.961 --> 00:09:34.212
Some of them are really unachievable.

00:09:34.562 --> 00:09:37.427
I did this once last October,

00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:39.169
by not eating for seven days.

00:09:39.969 --> 00:09:44.093
I did a fast for seven days
with six partners of mine.

00:09:44.598 --> 00:09:45.857
Look at those people.

00:09:45.881 --> 00:09:47.032
One smile.

00:09:47.056 --> 00:09:48.207
You know why he smiled?

00:09:48.231 --> 00:09:49.398
He cheated.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.422
(Laughter)

00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:53.582
He drank one cup of coffee at night,

00:09:53.606 --> 00:09:55.091
and we caught it from the data.

00:09:55.115 --> 00:09:56.160
(Laughter)

00:09:56.184 --> 00:09:58.644
We measured everything from the data.

00:09:58.668 --> 00:10:00.882
We were able to track them,

00:10:00.906 --> 00:10:02.464
and we could really see --

00:10:02.488 --> 00:10:04.489
for example, my immune system,

00:10:04.513 --> 00:10:06.275
just to give you a little hint there.

00:10:06.299 --> 00:10:10.603
My immune system changed
dramatically over 24 hours there.

00:10:11.738 --> 00:10:14.871
And my antibody regulates my proteins

00:10:14.895 --> 00:10:16.431
for that dramatic change.

00:10:16.455 --> 00:10:17.836
And everybody was doing that.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.192
Even if we're essentially
totally different at the very beginning.

00:10:21.216 --> 00:10:24.261
And that probably will be
an interesting treatment in the future

00:10:24.285 --> 00:10:25.928
for cancer and things like that.

00:10:25.952 --> 00:10:27.582
It becomes very, very interesting.

00:10:28.106 --> 00:10:30.807
But something you probably
don't want to try,

00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:34.507
like drinking fecal water
from a healthier individual,

00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:36.198
which will make you feel healthier.

00:10:36.222 --> 00:10:37.937
This is from old Chinese wisdom.

00:10:37.961 --> 00:10:39.397
Look at that, right?

00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:41.587
Like 1,700 years ago,

00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:43.891
it's already there, in the book.

00:10:44.428 --> 00:10:45.755
But I still hate the smell.

00:10:46.057 --> 00:10:47.207
(Laughter)

00:10:47.231 --> 00:10:49.637
I want to find out the true way to do it,

00:10:49.661 --> 00:10:54.015
maybe find a combination of cocktails
of bacterias and drink it,

00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:55.563
it probably will make me better.

00:10:55.587 --> 00:10:56.778
So I'm trying to do that.

00:10:56.802 --> 00:10:59.804
Even though I'm trying this hard,

00:10:59.828 --> 00:11:04.854
it's so difficult to test out
all possible conditions.

00:11:04.878 --> 00:11:10.115
It's not possible to do
all kinds of experiments at all ...

00:11:11.161 --> 00:11:14.974
but we do have seven billion
learning programs on this planet.

00:11:14.998 --> 00:11:16.264
Seven billion.

00:11:16.288 --> 00:11:19.939
And every program
is running in different conditions

00:11:19.963 --> 00:11:21.744
and doing different experiments.

00:11:21.768 --> 00:11:23.619
Can we all measure them?

00:11:24.782 --> 00:11:27.997
Seven years ago,
I wrote an essay in "Science"

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:31.313
to celebrate the human genome's
10-year anniversary.

00:11:31.995 --> 00:11:33.649
I said, "Sequence yourself,

00:11:33.673 --> 00:11:35.296
for one and for all."

00:11:35.618 --> 00:11:37.486
But now I'm going to say,

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:41.256
"Digitalize yourself for one and for all."

00:11:42.095 --> 00:11:47.695
When we make this digital me
into a digital we,

00:11:47.719 --> 00:11:51.471
when we try to form an internet of life,

00:11:51.495 --> 00:11:54.356
when people can learn from each other,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.087
when people can learn
from their experience,

00:11:57.111 --> 00:11:58.842
their data,

00:11:58.866 --> 00:12:02.467
when people can really form
a digital me by themselves

00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:04.102
and we learn from it,

00:12:05.236 --> 00:12:10.968
the digital we will be
totally different with a digital me.

00:12:10.992 --> 00:12:14.412
But it can only come from the digital me.

00:12:15.923 --> 00:12:18.902
And this is what I try to propose here.

00:12:19.941 --> 00:12:21.091
Join me --

00:12:21.764 --> 00:12:22.914
become we,

00:12:23.612 --> 00:12:28.550
and everybody should build up
their own digital me,

00:12:28.574 --> 00:12:33.093
because only by that
will you learn more about you,

00:12:33.117 --> 00:12:34.541
about me,

00:12:34.565 --> 00:12:35.730
about us ...

00:12:36.498 --> 00:12:40.178
about the question I just posed
at the very beginning:

00:12:40.202 --> 00:12:41.352
"What is life?"

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:43.055
Thank you.

00:12:43.079 --> 00:12:49.029
(Applause)

00:12:49.053 --> 00:12:51.814
Chris Anderson:
One quick question for you.

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:54.612
I mean, the work is amazing.

00:12:54.636 --> 00:12:57.834
I suspect one question people have is,

00:12:57.858 --> 00:13:01.139
as we look forward to these amazing
technical possibilities

00:13:01.163 --> 00:13:02.524
of personalized medicine,

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:05.851
in the near-term it feels like
they're only going to be affordable

00:13:05.875 --> 00:13:07.151
for a few people, right?

00:13:07.175 --> 00:13:10.166
It costs many dollars to do
all the sequencing and so forth.

00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:13.621
Is this going to lead to a kind of,

00:13:13.645 --> 00:13:15.962
you know, increasing inequality?

00:13:15.986 --> 00:13:19.897
Or do you have this vision
that the knowledge that you get

00:13:19.921 --> 00:13:21.273
from the pioneers

00:13:21.297 --> 00:13:23.393
can actually be
pretty quickly disseminated

00:13:23.417 --> 00:13:27.541
to help a broader set of recipients?

00:13:27.565 --> 00:13:29.099
Jun Wang: Well, good question.

00:13:29.123 --> 00:13:32.674
I'll tell you that seven years ago,
when I co-founded BGI,

00:13:32.698 --> 00:13:36.103
and served as the CEO
of the company there,

00:13:36.127 --> 00:13:38.508
the only goal there for me to do

00:13:38.532 --> 00:13:40.515
was to drive the sequencing cost down.

00:13:40.864 --> 00:13:43.639
It started from 100 million dollars
per human genome.

00:13:43.663 --> 00:13:46.254
Now, it's a couple hundred dollars
for a human genome.

00:13:46.278 --> 00:13:49.892
The only reason to do it
is to get more people to benefit from it.

00:13:50.198 --> 00:13:52.355
So for the digital me,
it's the same thing.

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:53.868
Now, you probably need,

00:13:53.892 --> 00:13:57.121
you know, one million dollars
to digitize a person.

00:13:57.621 --> 00:13:59.296
I think it has to be 100 dollars.

00:13:59.807 --> 00:14:03.856
It has to be free for many of those people
that urgently need that.

00:14:04.192 --> 00:14:05.459
So this is our goal.

00:14:05.813 --> 00:14:09.236
And it seems that with all
this merging of the technology,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.852
I'm thinking that in the very near future,

00:14:11.876 --> 00:14:14.241
let's say three to five years,

00:14:14.265 --> 00:14:15.747
it will come to reality.

00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:19.750
And this is the whole idea
of why I founded iCarbonX,

00:14:19.774 --> 00:14:20.993
my second company.

00:14:21.017 --> 00:14:23.885
It's really trying to get the cost down

00:14:23.909 --> 00:14:27.329
to a level where every individual
could have the benefit.

00:14:27.353 --> 00:14:30.401
CA: All right, so the dream is not
elite health services for few,

00:14:30.425 --> 00:14:31.659
it's to really try

00:14:31.683 --> 00:14:34.794
and actually make overall health care
much more cost effective --

00:14:34.818 --> 00:14:37.248
JW: But we started
from some early adopters,

00:14:37.272 --> 00:14:39.778
people believing ideas and so on,

00:14:39.802 --> 00:14:43.444
but eventually, it will become
everybody's benefit.

00:14:44.123 --> 00:14:46.456
CA: Well, Jun, I think
it's got to be true to say

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.438
you're one of the most amazing
scientific minds on the planet,

00:14:49.462 --> 00:14:50.891
and it's an honor to have you.

00:14:50.915 --> 00:14:52.073
JW: Thank you.

00:14:52.097 --> 00:14:53.247
(Applause)
