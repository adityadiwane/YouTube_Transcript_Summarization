00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Do you worry about what is going to kill you?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Heart disease, cancer,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
a car accident?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Most of us worry about things we can't control,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
like war, terrorism,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
But what really threatens humanity?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
A few years ago, Professor Vaclav Smil

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
tried to calculate the probability

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
of sudden disasters

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
large enough to change history.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
He called these,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
"massively fatal discontinuities,"

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
meaning that they could kill

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
up to 100 million people

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
in the next 50 years.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
He looked at the odds of another world war,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
of a massive volcanic eruption,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
even of an asteroid hitting the Earth.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
But he placed the likelihood of one such event

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
above all others

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
at close to 100 percent,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and that is a severe flu pandemic.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Now, you might think of flu

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
as just a really bad cold,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
but it can be a death sentence.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Every year, 36,000 people in the United States

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
die of seasonal flu.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
In the developing world, the data is much sketchier

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
but the death toll is almost

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
certainly higher.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
You know, the problem is if

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
this virus occasionally mutates

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
so dramatically,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
it essentially is a new virus

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and then we get a pandemic.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
In 1918, a new virus appeared

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
that killed some 50 to 100 million people.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
It spread like wildfire

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and some died within hours of developing symptoms.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Are we safer today?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Well, we seem to have dodged

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
the deadly pandemic this year

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
that most of us feared,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
but this threat could reappear at any time.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
The good news is that

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
we're at a moment in time

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
when science, technology, globalization is converging

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
to create an unprecedented possibility:

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
the possibility to make history

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
by preventing infectious diseases

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
that still account for one-fifth of all deaths

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and countless misery on Earth.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
We can do this.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
We're already preventing millions of deaths

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
with existing vaccines,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and if we get these to more people,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
we can certainly save more lives.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
But with new or better vaccines

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
for malaria, TB, HIV,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
pneumonia, diarrhea, flu,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
we could end suffering

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
So, I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
But first, I have to explain why they're important

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
because vaccines, the power of them,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
is really like a whisper.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
When they work, they can make history,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
but after a while

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
you can barely hear them.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Now, some of us are old enough

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
to have a small, circular scar on our arms

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
from an inoculation we received as children.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
But when was the last time you worried about smallpox,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
a disease that killed half a billion people last century

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and no longer is with us?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Or polio? How many of you remember the iron lung?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
We don't see scenes like this anymore

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
because of vaccines.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Now, it's interesting

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
because there are 30-odd diseases

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
that can be treated with vaccines now,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Why is that?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Well, here's the dirty little secret.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Until recently, we haven't had to know

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
exactly how a vaccine worked.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
You took a pathogen, you modified it,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
you injected it into a person or an animal

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and you saw what happened.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
This worked well for most pathogens,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
but not at all for HIV,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
for which humans have no natural immunity.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
So let's explore how vaccines work.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
They basically create a cache

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
of weapons for your immune system

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
which you can deploy when needed.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Now, when you get a viral infection,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
what normally happens is it takes days or weeks

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
for your body to fight back

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
at full strength,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
and that might be too late.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
When you're pre-immunized,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
what happens is you have forces in your body

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
pre-trained to recognize

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
and defeat specific foes.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
So that's really how vaccines work.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Now, let's take a look at a video

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
that we're debuting at TED, for the first time,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
on how an effective HIV vaccine might work.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.260
(Music)

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Narrator: A vaccine trains the body in advance

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
how to recognize and neutralize

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
a specific invader.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
After HIV penetrates the body's mucosal barriers,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
it infects immune cells to replicate.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
The invader draws the attention

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
of the immune system's front-line troops.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Dendritic cells, or macrophages,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
capture the virus and display pieces of it.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
are activated when they learn

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
HIV is present from the front-line troops.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
These memory cells immediately deploy

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
the exact weapons needed.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Memory B cells turn into plasma cells,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
which produce wave after wave

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
of the specific antibodies

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
that latch onto HIV

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
to prevent it from infecting cells,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
while squadrons of killer T cells

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
seek out and destroy cells

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
that are already HIV infected.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
The virus is defeated.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
Without a vaccine,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
these responses would have taken more than a week.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
By that time, the battle against HIV

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
would already have been lost.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Seth Berkley: Really cool video, isn't it?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
The antibodies you just saw in this video,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
in action, are the ones that make most vaccines work.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
So the real question then is:

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
How do we ensure that your body makes

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
the exact ones that we need to protect

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
against flu and HIV?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
The principal challenge for both of these viruses

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
is that they're always changing.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
So let's take a look at the flu virus.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
In this rendering of the flu virus,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And also, what the antibodies use is a handle

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
to essentially grab and neutralize the virus.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
When these mutate, they change their shape,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
So that's why every year

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
you can catch a slightly different strain of flu.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
It's also why in the spring,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
we have to make a best guess

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
at which three strains are going to prevail the next year,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
put those into a single vaccine

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
and rush those into production for the fall.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
Even worse,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
the most common influenza -- influenza A --

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
also infects animals

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
that live in close proximity to humans,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
and they can recombine

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
in those particular animals.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
In addition, wild aquatic birds

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
carry all known strains

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
of influenza.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
So, you've got this situation:

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
In 2003,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
we had an H5N1 virus

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
that jumped from birds into humans

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
in a few isolated cases

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
Now luckily, that particular virus,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
although very scary at the time,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
did not transmit from person to person

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
very easily.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
This year's H1N1 threat

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.260
was actually a human, avian, swine mixture

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
that arose in Mexico.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
It was easily transmitted,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
but, luckily, was pretty mild.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And so, in a sense,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
our luck is holding out,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
but you know, another wild bird could fly over at anytime.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Now let's take a look at HIV.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
As variable as flu is,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
HIV makes flu

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
look like the Rock of Gibraltar.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
The virus that causes AIDS

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
is the trickiest pathogen

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
scientists have ever confronted.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
It mutates furiously,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
it has decoys to evade the immune system,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
and it quickly hides itself

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
in your genome.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
Here's a slide looking at

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
the genetic variation of flu

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and comparing that to HIV,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
a much wilder target.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
In the video a moment ago,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
Now realize that in a recently infected person,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
there are millions of these ships;

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
each one is just slightly different.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Finding a weapon that recognizes

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and sinks all of them

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
makes the job that much harder.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
Now, in the 27 years since HIV

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
was identified as the cause of AIDS,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
we've developed more drugs to treat HIV

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
than all other viruses put together.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
These drugs aren't cures,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
but they represent a huge triumph of science

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
because they take away the automatic death sentence

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
from a diagnosis of HIV,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
at least for those who can access them.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
The vaccine effort though is really quite different.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
Large companies moved away from it

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
because they thought the science was so difficult

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
and vaccines were seen as poor business.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
but today, evidence tells us otherwise.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
In September,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
we had surprising but exciting findings

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
For the first time, we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans --

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
albeit, quite modestly --

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
and that particular vaccine was made

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
almost a decade ago.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Newer concepts and early testing now

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
show even greater promise in the best of our animal models.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
But in the past few months, researchers have also isolated

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
several new broadly neutralizing antibodies

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
from the blood of an HIV infected individual.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
Now, what does this mean?

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
We saw earlier that HIV

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
is highly variable,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
that a broad neutralizing antibody

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
latches on and disables

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
multiple variations of the virus.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
If you take these and you put them

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
in the best of our monkey models,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
they provide full protection from infection.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
In addition, these researchers found

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
a new site on HIV

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
where the antibodies can grab onto,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
and what's so special about this spot

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
is that it changes very little

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
as the virus mutates.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
It's like, as many times

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
as the virus changes its clothes,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.260
it's still wearing the same socks,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
and now our job is to make sure

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
we get the body to really hate those socks.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
So what we've got is a situation.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
The Thai results tell us

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
we can make an AIDS vaccine,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
and the antibody findings

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
tell us how we might do that.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
This strategy, working backwards

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
has never been done before in vaccine research.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
It's called retro-vaccinology,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
and its implications extend

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
way beyond that of just HIV.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
So think of it this way.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
We've got these new antibodies we've identified,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
and we know that they latch onto many, many variations of the virus.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
We know that they have to latch onto a specific part,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
present that through a vaccine,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
what we hope is we can prompt

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
your immune system to make these matching antibodies.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
And that would create

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
a universal HIV vaccine.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
Now, it sounds easier than it is

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
because the structure actually looks more like

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
this blue antibody diagram

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
attached to its yellow binding site,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
and as you can imagine, these three-dimensional structures

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
are much harder to work on.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
we'd love to hear about it.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
But, you know, the research that has occurred from HIV now

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
has really helped with innovation with other diseases.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
So for instance, a biotechnology company

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
has now found broadly neutralizing

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
antibodies to influenza,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
They're currently making a cocktail --

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
an antibody cocktail -- that can be used to treat

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
severe, overwhelming cases of flu.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
In the longer term, what they can do

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
is use these tools of retro-vaccinology

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
to make a preventive flu vaccine.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
Now, retro-vaccinology is just one technique

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
Let me give you another example.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
We talked about before the H and N spikes

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
on the surface of the flu virus.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Notice these other, smaller protuberances.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
These are largely hidden from the immune system.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
Now it turns out that these spots

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
also don't change much when the virus mutates.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
If you can cripple these with specific antibodies,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
you could cripple all versions of the flu.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
So far, animal tests indicate

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
although you might get a mild case.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
So if this works in humans, what we're talking about

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
is a universal flu vaccine,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
one that doesn't need to change every year

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
and would remove the threat of death.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
We really could think of flu, then,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
as just a bad cold.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
Of course, the best vaccine imaginable

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
is only valuable to the extent

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
we get it to everyone who needs it.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
So to do that, we have to combine

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
smart vaccine design with smart production methods

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
and, of course, smart delivery methods.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
So I want you to think back a few months ago.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
In June, the World Health Organization

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
declared the first global

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
flu pandemic in 41 years.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
The U.S. government promised

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
150 million doses of vaccine

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
by October 15th for the flu peak.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
Vaccines were promised to developing countries.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
So what happened?

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
Well, we first figured out

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
how to make flu vaccines, how to produce them,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
in the early 1940s.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
It was a slow, cumbersome process

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
that depended on chicken eggs,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
millions of living chicken eggs.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
Viruses only grow in living things,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
and so it turned out that, for flu,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
chicken eggs worked really well.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
For most strains, you could get one to two doses

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
of vaccine per egg.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
Luckily for us,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
we live in an era of breathtaking

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
biomedical advances.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
So today, we get our flu vaccines from ...

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
chicken eggs,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
(Laughter)

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
hundreds of millions of chicken eggs.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
Almost nothing has changed.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
The system is reliable

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
but the problem is you never know how well

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
a strain is going to grow.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
This year's swine flu strain

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
grew very poorly in early production:

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
basically .6 doses per egg.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
So, here's an alarming thought.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
What if that wild bird flies by again?

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
You could see an avian strain

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
that would infect the poultry flocks,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
So, Dan [Barber], if you want

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
billions of chicken pellets

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
for your fish farm,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
I know where to get them.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
So right now, the world can produce

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
about 350 million doses

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
of flu vaccine for the three strains,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
if we want to target a single variant

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
like swine flu.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
But this assumes that our factories are humming

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
because, in 2004,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
the U.S. supply was cut in half

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
by contamination at one single plant.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
And the process still takes

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
more than half a year.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
So are we better prepared

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
than we were in 1918?

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Well, with the new technologies emerging now,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
I hope we can say definitively, "Yes."

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
for everyone in the entire world

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
for less than half of what we're currently spending

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
now in the United States.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
With a range of new technologies, we could.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
Here's an example:

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
A company I'm engaged with has found

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
a specific piece of the H spike of flu

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
that sparks the immune system.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
If you lop this off and attach it

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
to the tail of a different bacterium,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
which creates a vigorous immune response,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
they've created a very powerful flu fighter.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
This vaccine is so small

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
it can be grown in a common bacteria, E. coli.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
Now, as you know, bacteria reproduce quickly --

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
it's like making yogurt --

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
and so we could produce enough swine origin flu

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
for the entire world in a few factories, in a few weeks,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
with no eggs,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
for a fraction of the cost of current methods.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:57.260
(Applause)

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
So here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
And, aside from the radically increased production

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
and huge cost savings --

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
for example, the E. coli method I just talked about --

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
look at the time saved: this would be lives saved.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
The developing world,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
mostly left out of the current response,

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
sees the potential of these alternate technologies

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
and they're leapfrogging the West.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
India, Mexico and others are already

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
making experimental flu vaccines,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
and they may be the first place

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
we see these vaccines in use.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
Because these technologies are so efficient

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
and relatively cheap,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
if we can figure out how to deliver them.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
Now think of where this leads us.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
New infectious diseases

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
appear or reappear

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
every few years.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
Some day, perhaps soon,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
Will we be quick enough to react

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
before millions die?

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.260
Luckily, this year's flu was relatively mild.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
I say, "luckily" in part

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
because virtually no one in the developing world

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
was vaccinated.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.260
So if we have the political and financial foresight

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
to sustain our investments,

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
we will master these and new tools of vaccinology,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
and with these tools we can produce

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
enough vaccine for everyone at low cost

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.260
and ensure healthy productive lives.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.260
No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.260
No longer does AIDS

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
need to kill two million a year.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
No longer do the poor and vulnerable

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
need to be threatened by infectious diseases,

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
or indeed, anybody.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.260
Instead of having Vaclav Smil's

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.260
"massively fatal discontinuity" of life,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
we can ensure

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260
the continuity of life.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.260
What the world needs now are these new vaccines,

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.260
and we can make it happen.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:59.260
(Applause)

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.260
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:06.260
(Applause)

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
Thank you.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.260
So, the science is changing.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.260
In your mind, Seth -- I mean, you must dream about this --

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.260
what is the kind of time scale

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
on, let's start with HIV,

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.260
for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable?

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
SB: The game change can come at any time,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260
because the problem we have now is

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans;

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
we just need a better one.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260
And with these types of antibodies, we know humans can make them.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.260
So, if we can figure out how to do that,

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.260
then we have the vaccine,

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.260
and what's interesting is there already is

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.260
some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.260
So, the challenge is full speed ahead.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.260
CA: In your gut, do you think it's probably going to be at least another five years?

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.260
SB: You know, everybody says it's 10 years,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.260
but it's been 10 years every 10 years.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.260
So I hate to put a timeline

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.260
on scientific innovation,

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.260
but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.260
CA: And that's the same with universal flu vaccine, the same kind of thing?

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.260
SB: I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.260
we've got a bunch -- I just showed some of this --

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.260
a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.260
They look good. The problem has been that,

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.260
what we did is we invested in traditional technologies

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.260
because that's what we were comfortable with.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.260
You also can use adjuvants, which are chemicals you mix.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.260
That's what Europe is doing, so we could have diluted out

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.260
our supply of flu and made more available,

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.260
but, going back to what Michael Specter said,

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.260
the anti-vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.260
CA: And malaria's even further behind?

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.260
SB: No, malaria, there is a candidate

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.260
that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.260
and is currently in phase three trials now.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.260
It probably isn't the perfect vaccine, but it's moving along.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.260
CA: Seth, most of us do work where every month,

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.260
we produce something;

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.260
we get that kind of gratification.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.260
You've been slaving away at this for more than a decade,

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.260
and I salute you and your colleagues for what you do.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.260
The world needs people like you. Thank you.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.260
SB: Thank you.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.260
(Applause)
