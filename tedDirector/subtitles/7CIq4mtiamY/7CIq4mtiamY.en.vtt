00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:13.744
I recently retired

00:00:13.744 --> 00:00:15.788
from the California Highway Patrol

00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:18.725
after 23 years of service.

00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:20.691
The majority of those 23 years

00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:23.319
was spent patrolling the southern end

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:24.852
of Marin County,

00:00:24.852 --> 00:00:28.029
which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.316
The bridge is an iconic structure,

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:31.569
known worldwide

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.245
for its beautiful views of San Francisco,

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:38.636
the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.

00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:43.052
Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,

00:00:43.052 --> 00:00:47.631
being one of the most utilized sites in the world.

00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:50.761
The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.

00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:55.084
Joseph Strauss, chief engineer
in charge of building the bridge,

00:00:55.084 --> 00:00:56.688
was quoted as saying,

00:00:56.688 --> 00:01:00.084
"The bridge is practically suicide-proof.

00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:01.793
Suicide from the bridge

00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:05.559
is neither practical nor probable."

00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:07.853
But since its opening,

00:01:07.853 --> 00:01:11.000
over 1,600 people have leapt to their death

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.162
from that bridge.

00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:15.366
Some believe that traveling

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.431
between the two towers

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:19.554
will lead you to another dimension --

00:01:19.554 --> 00:01:23.010
this bridge has been romanticized as such â€”

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.589
that the fall from that

00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:27.623
frees you from all your worries and grief,

00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:29.407
and the waters below

00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:31.531
will cleanse your soul.

00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:33.855
But let me tell you what actually occurs

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:35.041
when the bridge is used

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:37.095
as a means of suicide.

00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:40.549
After a free fall of four to five seconds,

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.218
the body strikes the water

00:01:43.218 --> 00:01:46.900
at about 75 miles an hour.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.617
That impact shatters bones,

00:01:49.617 --> 00:01:52.969
some of which then puncture vital organs.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.318
Most die on impact.

00:01:55.318 --> 00:01:57.070
Those that don't

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.663
generally flail in the water helplessly,

00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:01.882
and then drown.

00:02:01.882 --> 00:02:04.050
I don't think that those who contemplate

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.872
this method of suicide

00:02:05.872 --> 00:02:11.048
realize how grisly a death that they will face.

00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:13.176
This is the cord.

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:15.233
Except for around the two towers,

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.521
there is 32 inches of steel

00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:19.051
paralleling the bridge.

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.336
This is where most folks stand

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:23.870
before taking their lives.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.904
I can tell you from experience

00:02:25.904 --> 00:02:28.638
that once the person is on that cord,

00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:30.396
and at their darkest time,

00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:33.690
it is very difficult to bring them back.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.732
I took this photo last year

00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:37.668
as this young woman spoke to an officer

00:02:37.668 --> 00:02:39.666
contemplating her life.

00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:41.922
I want to tell you very happily

00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:44.030
that we were successful that day

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.954
in getting her back over the rail.

00:02:46.954 --> 00:02:49.346
When I first began working on the bridge,

00:02:49.346 --> 00:02:51.830
we had no formal training.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.624
You struggled to funnel your
way through these calls.

00:02:55.624 --> 00:02:58.078
This was not only a disservice

00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:00.127
to those contemplating suicide,

00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:02.920
but to the officers as well.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.100
We've come a long, long way since then.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.669
Now, veteran officers and psychologists

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.340
train new officers.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.549
This is Jason Garber.

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.760
I met Jason on July 22 of last year

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.875
when I get received a call

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:20.817
of a possible suicidal subject

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:23.566
sitting on the cord near midspan.

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:26.263
I responded, and when I arrived,

00:03:26.263 --> 00:03:28.077
I observed Jason

00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:31.448
speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.

00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:33.972
Jason was just 32 years old

00:03:33.972 --> 00:03:36.804
and had flown out here from New Jersey.

00:03:36.804 --> 00:03:38.348
As a matter of fact,

00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:40.166
he had flown out here on two other occasions

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:41.928
from New Jersey

00:03:41.928 --> 00:03:45.342
to attempt suicide on this bridge.

00:03:45.342 --> 00:03:48.900
After about an hour of speaking with Jason,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.635
he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.

00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:55.070
Recalling your Greek mythology,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.040
Zeus created Pandora,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.394
and sent her down to Earth with a box,

00:04:00.394 --> 00:04:04.298
and told her, "Never, ever open that box."

00:04:04.298 --> 00:04:06.940
Well one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.342
and she did open the box.

00:04:09.342 --> 00:04:12.194
Out flew plagues, sorrows,

00:04:12.194 --> 00:04:15.406
and all sorts of evils against man.

00:04:15.406 --> 00:04:19.985
The only good thing in the box was hope.

00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:22.558
Jason then asked us,

00:04:22.558 --> 00:04:25.542
"What happens when you open the box

00:04:25.542 --> 00:04:28.724
and hope isn't there?"

00:04:28.724 --> 00:04:31.774
He paused a few moments,

00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:34.213
leaned to his right,

00:04:34.213 --> 00:04:36.414
and was gone.

00:04:36.414 --> 00:04:40.284
This kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey

00:04:40.284 --> 00:04:44.064
had just committed suicide.

00:04:44.064 --> 00:04:47.064
I spoke with Jason's parents that evening,

00:04:47.064 --> 00:04:49.626
and I suppose that, when I was speaking with them,

00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:53.390
that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.610
because that very next day,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.130
their family rabbi called to check on me.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.924
Jason's parents had asked him to do so.

00:05:02.924 --> 00:05:05.132
The collateral damage of suicide

00:05:05.132 --> 00:05:10.235
affects so many people.

00:05:10.235 --> 00:05:13.216
I pose these questions to you:

00:05:13.216 --> 00:05:15.884
What would you do if your family member,

00:05:15.884 --> 00:05:18.992
friend or loved one was suicidal?

00:05:18.992 --> 00:05:21.426
What would you say?

00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:24.656
Would you know what to say?

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:28.582
In my experience, it's not just the talking that you do,

00:05:28.582 --> 00:05:30.830
but the listening.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.446
Listen to understand.

00:05:35.446 --> 00:05:37.974
Don't argue, blame,

00:05:37.974 --> 00:05:41.742
or tell the person you know how they feel,

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:44.353
because you probably don't.

00:05:44.353 --> 00:05:47.264
By just being there,

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:51.587
you may just be the turning point that they need.

00:05:51.587 --> 00:05:54.691
If you think someone is suicidal,

00:05:54.691 --> 00:05:58.405
don't be afraid to confront
them and ask the question.

00:05:58.405 --> 00:06:02.615
One way of asking them the question is like this:

00:06:02.615 --> 00:06:05.029
"Others in similar circumstances

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:07.197
have thought about ending their life;

00:06:07.197 --> 00:06:09.956
have you had these thoughts?"

00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:12.752
Confronting the person head-on

00:06:12.752 --> 00:06:16.702
may just save their life and
be the turning point for them.

00:06:16.702 --> 00:06:19.151
Some other signs to look for:

00:06:19.151 --> 00:06:23.299
hopelessness, believing that things are terrible

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:26.426
and never going to get better;

00:06:26.426 --> 00:06:29.871
helplessness, believing that there is nothing

00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:32.303
that you can do about it;

00:06:32.303 --> 00:06:34.900
recent social withdrawal;

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.717
and a loss of interest in life.

00:06:39.717 --> 00:06:43.639
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago,

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.840
and I received an email from a lady

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.325
that I'd like to read you her letter.

00:06:51.325 --> 00:06:59.437
She lost her son on January 19 of this year,

00:06:59.437 --> 00:07:01.250
and she wrote this me this email

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.620
just a couple of days ago,

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.620
and it's with her permission and blessing

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.645
that I read this to you.

00:07:09.645 --> 00:07:13.647
"Hi, Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference.

00:07:13.647 --> 00:07:16.581
That must be quite the experience to be there.

00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:20.213
I'm thinking I should go walk
the bridge this weekend.

00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:22.746
Just wanted to drop you a note.

00:07:22.746 --> 00:07:24.967
Hope you get the word out to many people

00:07:24.967 --> 00:07:27.079
and they go home talking about it

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:31.745
to their friends who tell their friends, etc.

00:07:31.745 --> 00:07:34.189
I'm still pretty numb,

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:37.261
but noticing more moments of really realizing

00:07:37.261 --> 00:07:39.973
Mike isn't coming home.

00:07:39.973 --> 00:07:42.720
Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.637
to watch the 49ers game with his father

00:07:44.637 --> 00:07:46.670
on January 19.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.614
He never made it there.

00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:51.661
I called Petaluma police

00:07:51.661 --> 00:07:54.157
and reported him missing that evening.

00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:56.059
The next morning,

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:59.782
two officers came to my home

00:07:59.782 --> 00:08:04.286
and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.

00:08:04.286 --> 00:08:06.750
A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.002
at 1:58 p.m. the previous day.

00:08:11.002 --> 00:08:13.622
Thanks so much

00:08:13.622 --> 00:08:14.806
for standing up for those

00:08:14.806 --> 00:08:17.358
who may be only temporarily too weak

00:08:17.358 --> 00:08:19.900
to stand for themselves.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.920
Who hasn't been low before

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.696
without suffering from a true mental illness?

00:08:25.696 --> 00:08:29.057
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.

00:08:29.057 --> 00:08:32.454
My prayers are with you for your fight.

00:08:32.454 --> 00:08:36.050
The GGB, Golden Gate Bridge,

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.776
is supposed to be a passage across

00:08:38.776 --> 00:08:40.859
our beautiful bay,

00:08:40.859 --> 00:08:43.546
not a graveyard.

00:08:43.546 --> 00:08:48.810
Good luck this week. Vicky."

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.853
I can't imagine the courage it takes for her

00:08:51.853 --> 00:08:53.795
to go down to that bridge and walk the path

00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:57.233
that her son took that day,

00:08:57.233 --> 00:09:02.307
and also the courage just to carry on.

00:09:02.307 --> 00:09:06.053
I'd like to introduce you to a man

00:09:06.053 --> 00:09:11.695
I refer to as hope and courage.

00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:14.334
On March 11 of 2005,

00:09:14.334 --> 00:09:16.997
I responded to a radio call of a possible

00:09:16.997 --> 00:09:19.211
suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk

00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:20.699
near the north tower.

00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:23.387
I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk

00:09:23.387 --> 00:09:26.099
and observed this man, Kevin Berthia,

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:28.635
standing on the sidewalk.

00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:32.060
When he saw me, he immediately traversed

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.237
that pedestrian rail,

00:09:34.237 --> 00:09:35.109
and stood on that small pipe

00:09:35.109 --> 00:09:38.181
which goes around the tower.

00:09:38.181 --> 00:09:40.515
For the next hour and a half,

00:09:40.515 --> 00:09:43.443
I listened as Kevin spoke about

00:09:43.443 --> 00:09:46.331
his depression and hopelessness.

00:09:46.331 --> 00:09:49.005
Kevin decided on his own that day

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.687
to come back over that rail

00:09:50.687 --> 00:09:53.419
and give life another chance.

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:55.190
When Kevin came back over,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.231
I congratulated him.

00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:59.981
"This is a new beginning, a new life."

00:09:59.981 --> 00:10:03.015
But I asked him, "What was it

00:10:03.015 --> 00:10:04.740
that made you come back

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.530
and give hope and life another chance?"

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.221
And you know what he told me?

00:10:10.221 --> 00:10:12.751
He said, "You listened.

00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:17.951
You let me speak, and you just listened."

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.910
Shortly after this incident,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.169
I received a letter from Kevin's mother,

00:10:23.169 --> 00:10:26.081
and I have that letter with me,

00:10:26.081 --> 00:10:28.931
and I'd like to read it to you.

00:10:28.931 --> 00:10:31.087
"Dear Mr. Briggs,

00:10:31.087 --> 00:10:33.952
Nothing will erase the events of March 11,

00:10:33.952 --> 00:10:37.080
but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.373
I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.

00:10:41.373 --> 00:10:44.095
He has been diagnosed with a mental illness

00:10:44.095 --> 00:10:46.929
for which he has been properly medicated.

00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:50.297
I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old,

00:10:50.297 --> 00:10:54.245
completely unaware of any hereditary traits,

00:10:54.245 --> 00:10:58.429
but, thank God, now we know.

00:10:58.429 --> 00:11:01.255
Kevin is straight, as he says.

00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:03.940
We truly thank God for you.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.341
Sincerely indebted to you,

00:11:06.341 --> 00:11:09.033
Narvella Berthia."

00:11:09.033 --> 00:11:11.081
And on the bottom she writes,

00:11:11.081 --> 00:11:16.517
"P.S. When I visited San Francisco
General Hospital that evening,

00:11:16.517 --> 00:11:18.445
you were listed as the patient.

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:21.740
Boy, did I have to straighten that one out."

00:11:23.427 --> 00:11:27.557
Today, Kevin is a loving father

00:11:27.557 --> 00:11:30.242
and contributing member of society.

00:11:30.242 --> 00:11:31.711
He speaks openly

00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:34.645
about the events that day and his depression

00:11:34.645 --> 00:11:36.327
in the hopes that his story

00:11:36.327 --> 00:11:39.401
will inspire others.

00:11:39.401 --> 00:11:42.831
Suicide is not just something
I've encountered on the job.

00:11:42.831 --> 00:11:44.863
It's personal.

00:11:44.863 --> 00:11:48.737
My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.

00:11:48.737 --> 00:11:52.611
That act, although ending his own pain,

00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:57.157
robbed me from ever getting to know him.

00:11:57.157 --> 00:11:59.823
This is what suicide does.

00:11:59.823 --> 00:12:02.171
For most suicidal folks,

00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:04.125
or those contemplating suicide,

00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:06.831
they wouldn't think of hurting another person.

00:12:06.831 --> 00:12:10.415
They just want their own pain to end.

00:12:10.415 --> 00:12:14.451
Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways:

00:12:14.451 --> 00:12:20.109
sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.

00:12:20.109 --> 00:12:22.829
In my career, I've responded to

00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:25.182
and been involved in hundreds

00:12:25.182 --> 00:12:27.960
of mental illness and suicide calls

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.754
around the bridge.

00:12:29.754 --> 00:12:33.265
Of those incidents I've been directly involved with,

00:12:33.265 --> 00:12:35.237
I've only lost two,

00:12:35.237 --> 00:12:37.423
but that's two too many.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:39.435
One was Jason.

00:12:39.435 --> 00:12:41.691
The other was a man I spoke to

00:12:41.691 --> 00:12:43.374
for about an hour.

00:12:43.374 --> 00:12:45.790
During that time, he shook my hand

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.527
on three occasions.

00:12:48.527 --> 00:12:50.603
On that final handshake,

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.937
he looked at me, and he said,

00:12:52.937 --> 00:12:58.340
"Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.473
And he leapt.

00:13:00.473 --> 00:13:03.279
Horrible, absolutely horrible.

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:05.255
I do want to tell you, though,

00:13:05.255 --> 00:13:07.607
the vast majority of folks

00:13:07.607 --> 00:13:11.129
that we do get to contact on that bridge

00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:14.325
do not commit suicide.

00:13:14.325 --> 00:13:17.315
Additionally, that very few

00:13:17.315 --> 00:13:19.971
who have jumped off the bridge and lived

00:13:19.971 --> 00:13:21.317
and can talk about it,

00:13:21.317 --> 00:13:24.130
that one to two percent,

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.961
most of those folks have said

00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:29.315
that the second that they let go of that rail,

00:13:29.315 --> 00:13:31.880
they knew that they had made a mistake

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.931
and they wanted to live.

00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:39.364
I tell people, the bridge not only connects

00:13:39.364 --> 00:13:41.645
Marin to San Francisco,

00:13:41.645 --> 00:13:44.837
but people together also.

00:13:44.837 --> 00:13:48.630
That connection, or bridge that we make,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.059
is something that each and every one of us

00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:53.053
should strive to do.

00:13:53.053 --> 00:13:56.077
Suicide is preventable.

00:13:56.077 --> 00:13:59.411
There is help. There is hope.

00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:02.441
Thank you very much.

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:06.441
(Applause)
