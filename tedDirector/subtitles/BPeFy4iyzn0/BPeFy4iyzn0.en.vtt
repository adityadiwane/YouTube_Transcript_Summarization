00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:15.264
This is a talk about sugar and cancer.

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.986
I became interested in sugar
when I was in college.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.862
Not this kind of sugar.

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:25.837
It was the sugar that our biology
professors taught us about

00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:30.003
in the context of the coating
of your cells.

00:00:30.553 --> 00:00:34.663
Maybe you didn't know that your cells
are coated with sugar.

00:00:34.687 --> 00:00:36.262
And I didn't know that, either,

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.441
until I took these courses in college,

00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:39.877
but back then --

00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:43.460
and this was in, let's just
call it the 1980s --

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.634
people didn't know much about why
our cells are coated with sugar.

00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:52.625
And when I dug through my notes,
what I noticed I had written down

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.194
is that the sugar coating on our cells
is like the sugar coating

00:00:57.218 --> 00:00:58.424
on a peanut M and M.

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:02.684
And people thought
the sugar coating on our cells

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:04.538
was like a protective coating

00:01:04.562 --> 00:01:07.813
that somehow made our cells
stronger or tougher.

00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:10.880
But we now know, many decades later,

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.180
that it's much more complicated than that,

00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:18.187
and that the sugars on our cells
are actually very complex.

00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:24.515
And if you could shrink yourself down
to a little miniature airplane

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.321
and fly right along
the surface of your cells,

00:01:28.345 --> 00:01:30.711
it might look something like this --

00:01:30.735 --> 00:01:32.936
with geographical features.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.990
And now, the complex sugars
are these trees and bushes --

00:01:37.014 --> 00:01:39.546
weeping willows that are
swaying in the wind

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.607
and moving with the waves.

00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:45.444
And when I started thinking about
all these complex sugars

00:01:45.468 --> 00:01:48.394
that are like this foliage on our cells,

00:01:48.418 --> 00:01:51.535
it became one of the most interesting
problems that I encountered

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:54.563
as a biologist and also as a chemist.

00:01:55.477 --> 00:01:58.412
And so now we tend
to think about the sugars

00:01:58.436 --> 00:02:01.704
that are populating
the surface of our cells

00:02:01.728 --> 00:02:03.523
as a language.

00:02:04.162 --> 00:02:08.043
They have a lot of information
stored in their complex structures.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.531
But what are they trying to tell us?

00:02:12.368 --> 00:02:15.683
I can tell you that we do know
some information

00:02:15.707 --> 00:02:17.312
that comes from these sugars,

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:20.271
and it's turned out already
to be incredibly important

00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:22.115
in the world of medicine.

00:02:22.597 --> 00:02:26.258
For example, one thing
your sugars are telling us

00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:27.739
is your blood type.

00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:33.015
So your blood cells, your red blood
cells, are coated with sugars,

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:37.716
and the chemical structures of those
sugars determine your blood type.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.663
So for example, I know
that I am blood type O.

00:02:41.687 --> 00:02:44.798
How many people are also blood type O?

00:02:44.822 --> 00:02:45.980
Put your hands up.

00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:47.197
It's a pretty common one,

00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:50.156
so when so few hands go up,
either you're not paying attention

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.070
or you don't know your blood type,
and both of those are bad.

00:02:53.094 --> 00:02:54.109
(Laughter)

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:56.796
But for those of you who share
the blood type O with me,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.535
what this means is that we have
this chemical structure

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.597
on the surface of our blood cells:

00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:05.839
three simple sugars linked together
to make a more complex sugar.

00:03:05.863 --> 00:03:08.131
And that, by definition, is blood type O.

00:03:09.186 --> 00:03:11.316
Now, how many people are blood type A?

00:03:12.394 --> 00:03:13.563
Right here.

00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:16.548
That means you have
an enzyme in your cells

00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:18.988
that adds one more building block,

00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:20.387
that red sugar,

00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:22.235
to build a more complex structure.

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.326
And how many people are blood type B?

00:03:26.118 --> 00:03:27.283
Quite a few.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:30.035
You have a slightly different enzyme
than the A people,

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:32.175
so you build a slightly
different structure,

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.312
and those of you that are AB

00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:37.528
have the enzyme from your mother,
the other enzyme from your father,

00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:41.327
and now you make both of these structures
in roughly equal proportions.

00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:43.755
And when this was figured out,

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.517
which is now back in the previous century,

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:50.058
this enabled one of the most important
medical procedures in the world,

00:03:50.082 --> 00:03:52.460
which, of course,
is the blood transfusion.

00:03:52.484 --> 00:03:54.380
And by knowing what your blood type is,

00:03:54.404 --> 00:03:56.996
we can make sure,
if you ever need a transfusion,

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.541
that your donor has the same blood type,

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:02.886
so that your body
doesn't see foreign sugars,

00:04:03.603 --> 00:04:06.040
which it wouldn't like
and would certainly reject.

00:04:07.933 --> 00:04:12.175
What else are the sugars on the surface
of your cells trying to tell us?

00:04:12.932 --> 00:04:17.625
Well, those sugars might be telling us
that you have cancer.

00:04:18.528 --> 00:04:20.780
So a few decades ago,

00:04:20.804 --> 00:04:26.197
correlations began to emerge
from the analysis of tumor tissue.

00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:30.732
And the typical scenario is a patient
would have a tumor detected,

00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:34.584
and the tissue would be removed
in a biopsy procedure

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:37.378
and then sent down to a pathology lab

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:41.533
where that tissue would be analyzed
to look for chemical changes

00:04:41.557 --> 00:04:46.271
that might inform the oncologist
about the best course of treatment.

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:49.683
And what was discovered
from studies like that

00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:52.571
is that the sugars have changed

00:04:52.595 --> 00:04:57.592
when the cell transforms
from being healthy to being sick.

00:04:58.643 --> 00:05:03.626
And those correlations have come up
again and again and again.

00:05:04.317 --> 00:05:08.783
But a big question in the field
has been: Why?

00:05:08.807 --> 00:05:13.051
Why do cancers have different sugars?
What's the importance of that?

00:05:13.075 --> 00:05:16.436
Why does it happen, and what
can we do about it if it does turn out

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.215
to be related to the disease process?

00:05:21.603 --> 00:05:24.814
So, one of the changes that we study

00:05:24.838 --> 00:05:30.383
is an increase in the density
of a particular sugar

00:05:30.407 --> 00:05:32.736
that's called sialic acid.

00:05:33.437 --> 00:05:37.361
And I think this is going to be
one of the most important sugars

00:05:37.385 --> 00:05:38.543
of our times,

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:42.642
so I would encourage everybody
to get familiar with this word.

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:46.287
Sialic acid is not
the kind of sugar that we eat.

00:05:46.311 --> 00:05:47.867
Those are different sugars.

00:05:48.422 --> 00:05:51.386
This is a kind of sugar
that is actually found

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.538
at certain levels on all
of the cells in your body.

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:57.430
It's actually quite common on your cells.

00:05:58.213 --> 00:05:59.524
But for some reason,

00:06:00.271 --> 00:06:05.759
cancer cells, at least in a successful,
progressive disease,

00:06:05.783 --> 00:06:08.892
tend to have more sialic acid

00:06:08.916 --> 00:06:11.263
than a normal, healthy cell would have.

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:12.729
And why?

00:06:12.753 --> 00:06:13.999
What does that mean?

00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:16.548
Well, what we've learned

00:06:16.572 --> 00:06:20.047
is that it has to do
with your immune system.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:24.321
So let me tell you a little bit
about the importance of your immune system

00:06:24.345 --> 00:06:25.509
in cancer.

00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:29.051
And this is something that's, I think,
in the news a lot these days.

00:06:29.075 --> 00:06:31.981
You know, people are starting
to become familiar with the term

00:06:32.005 --> 00:06:34.767
"cancer immune therapy."

00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:36.602
And some of you might even know people

00:06:36.626 --> 00:06:40.533
who are benefiting from these very new
ways of treating cancer.

00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:44.909
What we now know
is that your immune cells,

00:06:44.933 --> 00:06:48.867
which are the white blood cells
coursing through your bloodstream,

00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:53.547
protect you on a daily basis
from things gone bad --

00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:54.912
including cancer.

00:06:55.771 --> 00:06:57.762
And so in this picture,

00:06:57.786 --> 00:07:00.507
those little green balls
are your immune cells,

00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:03.479
and that big pink cell is a cancer cell.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.835
And these immune cells go around
and taste all the cells in your body.

00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:10.154
That's their job.

00:07:10.733 --> 00:07:13.488
And most of the time, the cells taste OK.

00:07:13.512 --> 00:07:16.016
But once in a while,
a cell might taste bad.

00:07:16.564 --> 00:07:18.375
Hopefully, that's the cancer cell,

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:20.782
and when those immune cells
get the bad taste,

00:07:20.806 --> 00:07:23.615
they launch an all-out strike
and kill those cells.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.603
So we know that.

00:07:25.627 --> 00:07:30.043
We also know that if you can
potentiate that tasting,

00:07:30.067 --> 00:07:33.895
if you can encourage those immune cells
to actually take a big old bite

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.162
out of a cancer cell,

00:07:35.186 --> 00:07:38.777
you get a better job protecting
yourself from cancer every day

00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:40.533
and maybe even curing a cancer.

00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:44.175
And there are now a couple of drugs
out there in the market

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:46.270
that are used to treat cancer patients

00:07:46.294 --> 00:07:49.035
that act exactly by this process.

00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:51.175
They activate the immune system

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.946
so that the immune system
can be more vigorous

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.722
in protecting us from cancer.

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:57.789
In fact, one of those drugs

00:07:57.813 --> 00:08:00.803
may well have spared
President Jimmy Carter's life.

00:08:01.336 --> 00:08:05.816
Do you remember, President Carter
had malignant melanoma

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.698
that had metastasized to his brain,

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:12.076
and that diagnosis is one
that is usually accompanied by numbers

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.945
like "months to live."

00:08:14.913 --> 00:08:19.308
But he was treated with one
of these new immune-stimulating drugs,

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:22.691
and now his melanoma
appears to be in remission,

00:08:22.715 --> 00:08:24.356
which is remarkable,

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.821
considering the situation
only a few years ago.

00:08:27.845 --> 00:08:29.665
In fact, it's so remarkable

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:32.489
that provocative statements like this one:

00:08:32.513 --> 00:08:36.228
"Cancer is having a penicillin moment,"
people are saying,

00:08:36.252 --> 00:08:38.073
with these new immune therapy drugs.

00:08:38.097 --> 00:08:41.295
I mean, that's an incredibly bold thing
to say about a disease

00:08:41.319 --> 00:08:43.968
which we've been fighting for a long time

00:08:43.992 --> 00:08:46.072
and mostly losing the battle with.

00:08:46.675 --> 00:08:48.204
So this is very exciting.

00:08:48.727 --> 00:08:51.139
Now what does this have to do with sugars?

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:53.883
Well, I'll tell you what we've learned.

00:08:54.764 --> 00:09:01.100
When an immune cell snuggles
up against a cancer cell to take a taste,

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:03.773
it's looking for signs of disease,

00:09:03.797 --> 00:09:05.716
and if it finds those signs,

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.986
the cell gets activated and it launches
a missile strike and kills the cell.

00:09:11.089 --> 00:09:16.899
But if that cancer cell has a dense forest
of that sugar, sialic acid,

00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:20.519
well, it starts to taste pretty good.

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:25.971
And there's a protein on immune cells
that grabs the sialic acid,

00:09:25.995 --> 00:09:29.796
and if that protein
gets held at that synapse

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.244
between the immune cell
and the cancer cell,

00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:34.976
it puts that immune cell to sleep.

00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:38.931
The sialic acids are telling
the immune cell,

00:09:38.955 --> 00:09:42.156
"Hey, this cell's all right.
Nothing to see here, move along.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.674
Look somewhere else."

00:09:44.561 --> 00:09:45.783
So in other words,

00:09:45.807 --> 00:09:50.551
as long as our cells are wearing
a thick coat of sialic acid,

00:09:51.219 --> 00:09:53.237
they look fabulous, right?

00:09:53.856 --> 00:09:55.208
It's amazing.

00:09:56.344 --> 00:09:59.498
And what if you could strip off that coat

00:09:59.522 --> 00:10:01.820
and take that sugar away?

00:10:01.844 --> 00:10:04.843
Well, your immune system

00:10:04.867 --> 00:10:09.068
might be able to see that cancer cell
for what it really is:

00:10:09.092 --> 00:10:11.316
something that needs to be destroyed.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:15.006
And so this is what we're doing in my lab.

00:10:15.524 --> 00:10:17.846
We're developing new medicines

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.927
that are basically
cell-surface lawnmowers --

00:10:21.681 --> 00:10:25.334
molecules that go down
to the surface of these cancer cells

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:28.223
and just cut off those sialic acids,

00:10:28.247 --> 00:10:32.552
so that the immune system
can reach its full potential

00:10:32.576 --> 00:10:35.233
in eliminating those cancer
cells from our body.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.934
So in closing,

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.792
let me just remind you again:

00:10:41.816 --> 00:10:44.083
your cells are coated with sugars.

00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:49.487
The sugars are telling cells
around that cell

00:10:49.511 --> 00:10:51.431
whether the cell is good or bad.

00:10:52.502 --> 00:10:53.667
And that's important,

00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:56.747
because our immune system needs
to leave the good cells alone.

00:10:56.771 --> 00:10:59.241
Otherwise, we'd have autoimmune diseases.

00:11:00.135 --> 00:11:03.283
But once in a while,
cancers get the ability

00:11:03.307 --> 00:11:04.863
to express these new sugars.

00:11:04.887 --> 00:11:06.219
And now that we understand

00:11:06.243 --> 00:11:09.403
how those sugars mesmerize
the immune system,

00:11:09.427 --> 00:11:13.612
we can come up with new medicines
to wake up those immune cells,

00:11:13.636 --> 00:11:16.863
tell them, "Ignore
the sugars, eat the cell

00:11:16.887 --> 00:11:19.470
and have a delicious snack, on cancer."

00:11:20.394 --> 00:11:21.557
Thank you.

00:11:21.893 --> 00:11:24.261
(Applause)
