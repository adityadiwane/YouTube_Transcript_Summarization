00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:32.870
(Music)

00:04:37.922 --> 00:04:40.676
(Music ends)

00:04:41.174 --> 00:04:47.339
(Applause)

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.452
Thank you!

00:05:00.476 --> 00:05:04.087
(Applause continues)

00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:06.378
Thank you very much.

00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:12.000
Like the speaker before me --
I am a TED virgin, I guess.

00:05:12.322 --> 00:05:15.254
I'm also the first time here, and ...

00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:16.399
(Laughter)

00:05:16.423 --> 00:05:17.684
I don't know what to say!

00:05:17.708 --> 00:05:21.141
(Applause)

00:05:21.165 --> 00:05:23.976
I'm really happy
that Mr. Anderson invited me.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I'm really grateful that I get a chance
to play for everyone.

00:05:27.523 --> 00:05:30.794
And the song that I just played
was by Josef Hofmann.

00:05:30.818 --> 00:05:32.667
It's called "Kaleidoscope."

00:05:32.691 --> 00:05:39.354
And Hofmann is a Polish pianist
and composer of the late 19th century,

00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:42.649
and he's widely considered
one of the greatest pianists of all time.

00:05:43.173 --> 00:05:45.705
I have another piece
that I'd like to play for you.

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.772
It's called "Abegg Variations,"
by Robert Schumann,

00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:52.637
a German 19th-century composer.

00:05:53.994 --> 00:05:58.145
The name "Abegg" is actually A-B-E-G-G,

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.112
and that's the main theme in the melody.

00:06:00.136 --> 00:06:02.635
(Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G)

00:06:04.007 --> 00:06:07.772
That comes from the last name
of one of Schumann's female friends.

00:06:08.673 --> 00:06:10.446
(Laughter)

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.573
But he wrote that for his wife.

00:06:12.597 --> 00:06:15.975
(Laughter)

00:06:16.715 --> 00:06:18.541
So actually, if you listen carefully,

00:06:18.565 --> 00:06:21.553
there are supposed to be
five variations on this Abegg theme.

00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:24.590
It's written around 1834,

00:06:24.614 --> 00:06:26.891
so even though it's old,
I hope you'll like it.

00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:35.976
(Music)

00:13:19.987 --> 00:13:21.987
(Music ends)

00:13:23.312 --> 00:13:30.171
(Applause)

00:13:30.748 --> 00:13:32.352
Now comes the part that I hate.

00:13:35.591 --> 00:13:38.047
Well, because Mr. Anderson told me

00:13:38.071 --> 00:13:40.948
that this session is called
"Sync and Flow,"

00:13:40.972 --> 00:13:43.969
I was wondering, "What do I know
that these geniuses don't?"

00:13:43.993 --> 00:13:45.160
(Laughter)

00:13:45.184 --> 00:13:47.309
So, I'll talk about musical composition,

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:49.314
even though I don't know where to start.

00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:52.000
How do I compose?

00:13:52.544 --> 00:13:56.055
I think Yamaha does a really good job
of teaching us how to compose.

00:13:56.452 --> 00:14:00.139
What I do first is, I make a lot
of little musical ideas

00:14:00.163 --> 00:14:02.354
you can just improvise
here at the piano --

00:14:02.378 --> 00:14:06.095
and I choose one of those
to become my main theme, my main melody,

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:08.000
like the Abegg that you just heard.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.802
And once I choose my main theme,
I have to decide:

00:14:11.826 --> 00:14:15.168
Out of all the styles in music,
what kind of style do I want?

00:14:15.628 --> 00:14:18.219
And this year,
I composed a Romantic style.

00:14:18.568 --> 00:14:22.445
So for inspiration,
I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky

00:14:22.469 --> 00:14:24.444
and all the great Romantic composers.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.000
Next, I make the structure
of the entire piece with my teachers.

00:14:30.443 --> 00:14:32.388
They help me plan out the whole piece.

00:14:32.412 --> 00:14:36.114
And then the hard part
is filling it in with musical ideas,

00:14:36.138 --> 00:14:38.112
because then you have to think.

00:14:38.136 --> 00:14:39.909
(Laughter)

00:14:39.933 --> 00:14:43.412
And then, when the piece
takes somewhat of a solified form --

00:14:43.436 --> 00:14:45.658
solidified, excuse me -- solidified form,

00:14:45.682 --> 00:14:50.708
you're supposed to actually
polish the piece, polish the details,

00:14:50.732 --> 00:14:54.000
and then polish the overall
performance of the composition.

00:14:54.843 --> 00:14:57.888
And another thing
that I enjoy doing is drawing.

00:14:57.912 --> 00:15:01.396
Drawing, because I like to draw,
you know, Japanese anime art.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.703
I think that's a craze
among teens right now.

00:15:04.385 --> 00:15:06.037
And once I realized it,

00:15:06.061 --> 00:15:10.057
there's a parallel between creating
music and creating art,

00:15:10.081 --> 00:15:15.191
because for your motive, or your
little initial idea for your drawing,

00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:18.183
it's your character -- you want
to decide who you want to draw,

00:15:18.207 --> 00:15:20.363
or if you want to draw
an original character.

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:23.884
And then you want to decide:
How are you going to draw the character?

00:15:23.908 --> 00:15:27.320
Like, am I going to use one page?
Am I going to draw it on the computer?

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:30.520
Am I going to use a two-page spread
like a comic book?

00:15:30.544 --> 00:15:32.747
For a more grandiose effect, I guess.

00:15:33.131 --> 00:15:36.278
And then you have to do
the initial sketch of the character,

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:38.340
which is like your structure of a piece,

00:15:38.364 --> 00:15:42.124
and then you add pen and pencil,
and whatever details that you need --

00:15:42.148 --> 00:15:43.644
that's polishing the drawing.

00:15:44.025 --> 00:15:47.747
And another thing that both of these
have in common is your state of mind,

00:15:47.771 --> 00:15:52.757
because I know I'm one of those teenagers
that are really easily distracted.

00:15:52.781 --> 00:15:57.796
So if I'm trying to do homework
and I don't feel like it,

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.573
I'll try to draw or,
you know, waste my time.

00:16:00.999 --> 00:16:03.777
And then what happens is,
sometimes I absolutely can't draw

00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:05.762
or I can't compose at all,

00:16:05.786 --> 00:16:08.092
and then it's like
there's too much on your mind.

00:16:08.116 --> 00:16:10.493
You can't focus
on what you're supposed to do.

00:16:10.517 --> 00:16:15.818
And sometimes, if you manage to use
your time wisely and work on it,

00:16:15.842 --> 00:16:18.931
you'll get something out of it,
but it doesn't come naturally.

00:16:19.486 --> 00:16:21.970
What happens is,
if something magical happens,

00:16:21.994 --> 00:16:24.598
if something natural happens to you,

00:16:24.622 --> 00:16:28.241
you're able to produce
all this beautiful stuff instantly,

00:16:28.265 --> 00:16:30.393
and then that's what I consider "flow,"

00:16:30.417 --> 00:16:34.385
because that's when everything clicks
and you're able to do anything.

00:16:34.409 --> 00:16:38.170
You feel like you're on top of your game
and you can do anything you want.

00:16:38.194 --> 00:16:41.415
I'm not going to play
my own composition today because,

00:16:41.439 --> 00:16:44.000
although I did finish it,
it's way too long.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.238
Instead, I'd like to try something
called "improvisation."

00:16:48.262 --> 00:16:50.483
I have here seven note cards,

00:16:50.507 --> 00:16:53.690
one with each note
of the musical alphabet.

00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:57.597
And I'd like someone to come up here
and choose five --

00:16:57.621 --> 00:16:59.609
anyone to come up here and choose five --

00:16:59.633 --> 00:17:02.345
and then I can make it
into some sort of melody,

00:17:02.369 --> 00:17:03.749
and I'll improvise it.

00:17:04.711 --> 00:17:07.842
Wow. A volunteer, yay!

00:17:07.866 --> 00:17:09.340
(Laughter)

00:17:09.364 --> 00:17:12.490
(Applause)

00:17:12.514 --> 00:17:14.125
Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you.

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:17.620
Goldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five?

00:17:17.644 --> 00:17:19.706
JL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.296
GH: OK, one.
JL: OK.

00:17:22.185 --> 00:17:23.756
GH: Two.
JL: Yes.

00:17:25.025 --> 00:17:26.176
GH: Three.

00:17:28.009 --> 00:17:30.508
GH: Oh, D and F -- too familiar.

00:17:30.532 --> 00:17:35.141
(Laughter)

00:17:35.165 --> 00:17:38.501
JL: One more.
GH: OK. "E" for "effort."

00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:41.796
JL: Would you mind reading them out
in the order that you chose them?

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:48.111
GH: OK -- C, G, B, A and E.

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:49.289
JL: Thank you very much!

00:17:49.313 --> 00:17:51.289
GH: You're welcome. And what about these?

00:17:51.313 --> 00:17:53.839
JL: I won't use them. Thank you!

00:17:55.204 --> 00:18:01.461
(Applause)

00:18:02.152 --> 00:18:05.530
Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E.

00:18:05.554 --> 00:18:07.974
I'm going to try to put that
in some sort of order.

00:18:07.998 --> 00:18:11.510
(Plays notes)

00:18:13.606 --> 00:18:15.344
OK, that's nice.

00:18:16.036 --> 00:18:17.973
So, I'm going to have a moment to think,

00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:20.239
and I'll try to make something out of it.

00:18:25.134 --> 00:18:28.382
(Plays the five notes)

00:18:36.044 --> 00:18:42.897
(Music)

00:21:52.201 --> 00:21:54.202
(Music ends)

00:21:54.226 --> 00:22:01.004
(Applause)

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:03.592
The next song, or the encore
that I'm going to play

00:22:03.616 --> 00:22:07.000
is called "Bumble Boogie," by Jack Fina.

00:22:07.979 --> 00:22:09.288
(Applause)

00:22:12.689 --> 00:22:18.414
(Music)

00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:06.522
(Music ends)

00:24:06.546 --> 00:24:13.000
(Applause)
