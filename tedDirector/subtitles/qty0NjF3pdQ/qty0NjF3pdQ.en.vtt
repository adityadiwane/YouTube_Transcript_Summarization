00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:15.864
Caitlin Quattromani: The election
of 2016 felt different.

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:19.421
Political conversations
with our family and friends

00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:21.231
uncovered a level of polarization

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.849
that many of us had not
previously experienced.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.013
People who we always thought
were reasonable and intelligent

00:00:28.037 --> 00:00:29.622
seemed like strangers.

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:32.305
We said to ourselves,
"How could you think that?

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.201
I thought you were smart."

00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:37.618
Lauran Arledge: Caitlin and I met
in the summer of 2011,

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:39.532
and we bonded around being working moms

00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:42.622
and trying to keep
our very energetic boys busy.

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:45.646
And we soon found out
we had almost everything in common.

00:00:46.138 --> 00:00:49.631
From our love of Colorado
to our love of sushi,

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:51.725
there wasn't much we didn't agree on.

00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:55.474
We also discovered that we share
a deep love of this country

00:00:55.498 --> 00:00:58.458
and feel a responsibility
to be politically active.

00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:00.727
But no one's perfect --

00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:01.799
(Laughter)

00:01:01.823 --> 00:01:05.826
and I soon found out
two disappointing things about Caitlin.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.473
First, she hates camping.

00:01:08.497 --> 00:01:10.545
CQ: I think camping is the worst.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:14.187
LA: So there would not be
any joint camping trips in our future.

00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:18.561
The second thing is that
she's politically active all right --

00:01:18.585 --> 00:01:19.805
as a conservative.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.712
CQ: I may hate camping,
but I love politics.

00:01:23.736 --> 00:01:26.941
I listen to conservative talk radio
just about every day,

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:30.664
and I've volunteered for a few different
conservative political campaigns.

00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:33.433
LA: And I'd say I'm a little to the left,

00:01:33.457 --> 00:01:34.871
like all the way to the left.

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:36.474
(Laughter)

00:01:36.498 --> 00:01:38.594
I've always been interested in politics.

00:01:38.618 --> 00:01:40.196
I was a political science major,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.603
and I worked as a community organizer
and on a congressional campaign.

00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:46.648
CQ: So as Lauran and I
were getting to know each other,

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:49.595
it was right in the middle
of that 2012 presidential campaign,

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.112
and most of our early
political conversations

00:01:52.136 --> 00:01:54.651
were really just based
in jokes and pranks.

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:58.096
So as an example, I would change
Lauran's computer screen saver

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.549
to a picture of Mitt Romney,

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:02.970
or she would put an Obama
campaign magnet on the back of my car.

00:02:02.994 --> 00:02:04.005
(Laughter)

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:06.069
LA: Car, not minivan.

00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:09.101
CQ: But over time,
those conversations grew more serious

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.784
and really became
a core of our friendship.

00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:13.226
And somewhere along the line,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.229
we decided we didn't want to have
any topic be off limits for discussion,

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:21.427
even if those topics pushed us way
outside of our friendship comfort zone.

00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:22.935
LA: And so to most of us,

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.555
political conversations
are a zero-sum game.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.556
There's a winner and there's a loser.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.833
We go for the attack and we spot
a weakness in someone's argument.

00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:32.340
And here's the important part:

00:02:32.364 --> 00:02:35.460
we tend to take every comment
or opinion that's expressed

00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:38.570
as a personal affront
to our own values and beliefs.

00:02:39.337 --> 00:02:42.440
But what if changed the way
we think about these conversations?

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:45.297
What if, in these heated moments,

00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:47.598
we chose dialogue over debate?

00:02:48.606 --> 00:02:51.486
When we engage in dialogue,
we flip the script.

00:02:52.118 --> 00:02:54.895
We replace our ego and our desire to win

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.998
with curiosity, empathy

00:02:57.022 --> 00:02:58.507
and a desire to learn.

00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:00.597
Instead of coming
from a place of judgment,

00:03:00.621 --> 00:03:04.493
we are genuinely interested
in the other person's experiences,

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.517
their values and their concerns.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.182
CQ: You make it sound so simple, Lauran.

00:03:09.601 --> 00:03:12.422
But getting to that place
of true dialogue is hard,

00:03:12.446 --> 00:03:14.857
especially when we're talking
about politics.

00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:17.496
It is so easy to get emotionally fired up

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.636
about issues that we're passionate about,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.595
and we can let our ego
get in the way of truly hearing

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.352
the other person's perspective.

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:26.949
And in this crazy political climate
we're in right now,

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:29.765
unfortunately, we're seeing
an extreme result

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:32.135
of those heated political conversations,

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.128
to the point where people are willing
to walk away from their relationships.

00:03:36.152 --> 00:03:39.121
In fact, Rasmussen released
a poll earlier this year

00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:43.859
that said 40 percent of people
reported that the 2016 election

00:03:43.883 --> 00:03:46.907
negatively impacted
a personal relationship,

00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:49.367
and the Journal of Cognitive
Neuroscience tells us

00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:52.320
that people tend to feel
their way to their beliefs

00:03:52.344 --> 00:03:54.057
rather than using reasoning,

00:03:54.081 --> 00:03:57.138
and that when reason and emotion collide,

00:03:57.162 --> 00:03:59.582
it's emotion that invariably wins.

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:02.185
So no wonder it's hard
to talk about these issues.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.258
LA: And look, we're just
two regular friends

00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:06.592
who happen to think very differently

00:04:06.616 --> 00:04:09.916
about politics and the role
that government should play in our lives.

00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:12.871
And I know we were all taught
not to talk about politics

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:14.339
because it's not polite,

00:04:14.363 --> 00:04:16.276
but we need to be able to talk about it,

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.455
because it's important to us
and it's a part of who we are.

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.241
CQ: We have chosen
to avoid political debate

00:04:22.265 --> 00:04:24.488
and instead engage in dialogue

00:04:24.512 --> 00:04:27.053
in order to maintain what we fondly call

00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:28.854
our bipartisan friendship.

00:04:28.878 --> 00:04:30.608
(Laughter)

00:04:30.632 --> 00:04:33.640
LA: And this election
and all of the craziness that has followed

00:04:33.664 --> 00:04:36.693
has given us several opportunities
to practice this skill.

00:04:36.717 --> 00:04:38.559
(Laughter)

00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:40.775
Let's start with January
and the Women's March.

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:44.226
At this point, you can probably guess
which one of us participated.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.593
(Laughter)

00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:47.586
CQ: Oh, the Women's March.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.412
I was annoyed and irritated
that entire day,

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:52.227
really because of two things.

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:55.116
Number one, the name "Women's March."

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.376
As a conservative woman,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.392
the march's platform of issues
didn't represent me,

00:04:59.416 --> 00:05:00.590
and that's OK,

00:05:00.614 --> 00:05:03.885
but hearing it talked about
as this demonstration of sisterhood

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.576
and solidarity for all women

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.259
didn't ring true for me.

00:05:07.283 --> 00:05:09.332
The other piece
was the timing of the event,

00:05:09.356 --> 00:05:12.664
the fact that it was the day
after the presidential inauguration.

00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:15.404
It felt like we weren't even
giving the new administration

00:05:15.428 --> 00:05:17.581
to actually do anything, good or bad,

00:05:17.605 --> 00:05:20.335
before people felt the need
to demonstrate against it.

00:05:20.706 --> 00:05:23.660
LA: And under normal circumstances,
I would agree with Caitlin.

00:05:23.684 --> 00:05:26.685
I think an administration
does deserve the benefit of the doubt.

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:29.976
But in this case, I was marching
to show my concern

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.469
that a man with such a poor track record
with women and other groups

00:05:33.493 --> 00:05:35.007
had been elected as president.

00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:37.613
I had to be part of the collective voice

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:40.579
that wanted to send a clear message
to the new president

00:05:40.603 --> 00:05:42.867
that we did not accept or condone

00:05:42.891 --> 00:05:45.347
his behavior or rhetoric
during the election.

00:05:45.885 --> 00:05:48.443
CQ: So I'm already feeling
kind of aggravated,

00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:52.880
and then I see this Facebook from Lauran
pop up in my social media feed.

00:05:52.904 --> 00:05:53.911
(Laughter)

00:05:53.935 --> 00:05:57.252
Seeing Lauran's sons at the march
and holding signs

00:05:57.276 --> 00:06:00.570
took it to a new level for me,
and not in a good way,

00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:02.190
because I know these boys,

00:06:02.214 --> 00:06:03.650
I love these boys,

00:06:03.674 --> 00:06:05.556
and I didn't feel they were old enough

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.492
to understand what the march stood for.

00:06:07.516 --> 00:06:09.563
I didn't understand
why Lauran would choose

00:06:09.587 --> 00:06:11.380
to have them participate in that way,

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:14.728
and I assumed it wasn't a choice
that the boys made for themselves.

00:06:14.752 --> 00:06:17.130
But I also know Lauran.

00:06:17.154 --> 00:06:18.369
You're an incredible mom

00:06:18.393 --> 00:06:20.928
who would never exploit
your boys in any way,

00:06:20.952 --> 00:06:22.699
so I had to stop and check myself.

00:06:22.723 --> 00:06:24.387
I had a decision to make.

00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:26.015
I could take the easy way out

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.789
and just choose
not to say anything to her,

00:06:28.813 --> 00:06:31.830
and instead just kind of simmer
in my frustration,

00:06:31.854 --> 00:06:35.061
or I could ask her to learn more
about her motivations.

00:06:35.085 --> 00:06:36.467
LA: And I shared with Caitlin

00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:38.800
that we actually started
talking about the March

00:06:38.824 --> 00:06:40.470
weeks before we participated.

00:06:40.494 --> 00:06:43.698
And my boys were curious
as to why the event was being organized,

00:06:43.722 --> 00:06:46.927
and this led to some
very interesting family conversations.

00:06:47.403 --> 00:06:50.927
We talked about how in this country,
we have the right and the privilege

00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:53.673
to demonstrate against
something we don't agree with,

00:06:53.697 --> 00:06:56.809
and my husband shared with them
why he thought it was so important

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.783
that men joined the Women's March.

00:06:58.807 --> 00:07:01.688
But the most significant reason
we marched as a family

00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:04.822
is that it was a way for us to honor
my parents' legacy.

00:07:05.187 --> 00:07:06.660
They spent their careers

00:07:06.684 --> 00:07:10.568
working to defend the rights
of some of our most vulnerable citizens,

00:07:10.592 --> 00:07:13.165
and they passed these values
down to me and my brother,

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:15.343
and we want to do the same with our sons.

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:16.706
CQ: After talking to Lauran,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.587
I really understood not only
why she felt it was so important to march,

00:07:20.611 --> 00:07:22.500
but why she had her boys with her.

00:07:22.524 --> 00:07:24.771
And frankly, my assumptions were wrong.

00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:26.500
It was the boys who wanted to march

00:07:26.524 --> 00:07:28.715
after they talked about
the issues as a family.

00:07:29.163 --> 00:07:31.271
But what's most important
about this example

00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:33.096
is to think about the alternative.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.939
Had Lauran and I not talked about it,

00:07:34.963 --> 00:07:36.631
I would have been annoyed with her,

00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:39.432
and it could have resulted
in an undercurrent of disrespect

00:07:39.456 --> 00:07:40.622
in our friendship.

00:07:40.646 --> 00:07:43.800
But by asking Lauran questions,
it allowed us to use dialogue

00:07:43.824 --> 00:07:45.848
to get to a place of true understanding.

00:07:46.203 --> 00:07:47.772
Now, to be clear,

00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:51.661
our conversation didn't really change
my mind about how I felt about the March,

00:07:51.685 --> 00:07:55.825
but it absolutely changed my thinking
around why she brought her boys with her.

00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:58.834
And for both of us,
that dialogue allowed us to understand

00:07:58.858 --> 00:08:01.127
each other's perspective
about the Women's March

00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:02.468
even though we disagreed.

00:08:03.135 --> 00:08:06.750
LA: The second topic that challenged
our ability to engage in dialogue

00:08:06.774 --> 00:08:08.787
was around my need to understand

00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:10.747
how Caitlin could vote for Trump.

00:08:11.318 --> 00:08:16.580
(Laughter)

00:08:17.303 --> 00:08:20.728
Caitlin is a successful professional woman

00:08:20.752 --> 00:08:23.359
who is deeply caring and compassionate,

00:08:23.383 --> 00:08:24.764
and the Caitlin I know

00:08:24.788 --> 00:08:27.947
would never excuse any man
from talking about women

00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:30.105
the way that Trump did
during the campaign.

00:08:30.571 --> 00:08:33.630
It was hard for me to reconcile
these two things in my mind.

00:08:33.654 --> 00:08:36.055
How could you overlook
the things that were said?

00:08:36.757 --> 00:08:39.711
CQ: So I'm guessing I may not be
the only one here that thought

00:08:39.735 --> 00:08:43.117
we didn't have the best choices
for the presidential election last year.

00:08:43.141 --> 00:08:44.560
(Laughter)

00:08:44.584 --> 00:08:48.480
The Republican candidate who I did support
didn't make it out of the primary,

00:08:48.504 --> 00:08:51.298
so when it came time to vote,
I had a decision to make.

00:08:51.604 --> 00:08:53.891
And you're right,
there were some terrible things

00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:56.028
that came out during the Trump campaign,

00:08:56.052 --> 00:08:58.575
so much so that I almost decided
to just abstain

00:08:58.599 --> 00:09:00.184
rather than voting for president,

00:09:00.208 --> 00:09:02.962
something I had never
even considered doing before.

00:09:02.986 --> 00:09:05.185
But ultimately,
I did vote for Donald Trump,

00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:08.730
and for me it was really a vote
for party over person,

00:09:08.754 --> 00:09:12.476
especially recognizing
how important that presidential pick is

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.500
on influencing our judicial branch.

00:09:15.148 --> 00:09:18.323
But I shared with Lauran
it was a decision I really wrestled with,

00:09:18.347 --> 00:09:20.084
and not one that I made lightly.

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:24.083
LA: And so after our conversation,
I was struck by a few things.

00:09:24.107 --> 00:09:27.516
First, I had fallen victim
to my own confirmation bias.

00:09:27.846 --> 00:09:30.194
Because of my strong feelings about Trump,

00:09:30.218 --> 00:09:32.886
I had given all Trump voters
the same attributes,

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.474
and none of them forgiving.

00:09:34.498 --> 00:09:35.648
(Laughter)

00:09:35.672 --> 00:09:39.156
But knowing Caitlin,
I started to ask questions.

00:09:39.846 --> 00:09:42.336
What were Trump voters
really concerned about?

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.542
Under all the divisive language,
what was really going on?

00:09:46.003 --> 00:09:48.708
What could we learn
about ourselves and our country

00:09:48.732 --> 00:09:50.258
from this unlikely event?

00:09:51.156 --> 00:09:55.514
I also learned that we shared
a deep disappointment in this election,

00:09:55.538 --> 00:09:59.108
and that we have growing concerns
about our two-party political system.

00:09:59.635 --> 00:10:02.250
But the most important thing
about this conversation

00:10:02.274 --> 00:10:03.659
is that it happened at all.

00:10:04.894 --> 00:10:08.282
Without an open and honest dialogue
between the two of us,

00:10:08.306 --> 00:10:10.958
this election would have been
the elephant in the room

00:10:10.982 --> 00:10:13.647
for the next four years, pun intended.

00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:18.091
(Laughter)

00:10:18.115 --> 00:10:19.266
CQ: So, look --

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.552
(Applause)

00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:24.965
So, look -- we know it takes work
to get past the difficult,

00:10:24.989 --> 00:10:27.354
frustrating and sometimes emotional parts

00:10:27.378 --> 00:10:30.339
of having discussions about issues
like the Women's March

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:34.497
or why your friend may have voted
for a candidate that you can't stand.

00:10:35.072 --> 00:10:37.287
But we need to have these conversations.

00:10:37.311 --> 00:10:39.858
Our ability to move past political debate

00:10:39.882 --> 00:10:41.358
into true dialogue

00:10:41.382 --> 00:10:44.384
is a critical skill we should all
be focused on right now,

00:10:44.408 --> 00:10:47.104
especially with the people
that we care about the most.

00:10:47.724 --> 00:10:50.987
LA: And it's not just as adults
that we need to bottle this behavior.

00:10:51.011 --> 00:10:53.682
It's critical that we do it
for our children as well.

00:10:54.023 --> 00:10:56.693
My sons were inundated with this election.

00:10:56.717 --> 00:10:58.861
We were listening
to the news in the morning,

00:10:58.885 --> 00:11:01.954
and they were having conversations
with their friends at school.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.500
I was concerned that they were picking up
so much polarizing misinformation,

00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:09.602
and they were growing really fearful
of a Trump presidency.

00:11:10.554 --> 00:11:15.055
Then one day, after the election,
I was taking my sons to school,

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:17.548
and my younger son,
completely out of the blue,

00:11:17.572 --> 00:11:22.476
said, "Mom, we don't know anybody
who voted for Trump, right?"

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.469
(Laughter)

00:11:25.493 --> 00:11:29.429
And I paused and I took a deep breath.

00:11:30.063 --> 00:11:31.245
"Yes, we do."

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:32.269
(Laughter)

00:11:32.293 --> 00:11:33.443
"The Quattromanis."

00:11:33.764 --> 00:11:35.833
And his response was so great.

00:11:35.857 --> 00:11:39.047
He kind of got this confused
look on his face, and he said ...

00:11:39.539 --> 00:11:40.690
"But we love them."

00:11:40.714 --> 00:11:43.682
(Laughter)

00:11:43.706 --> 00:11:45.499
And I answered, "Yes, we do."

00:11:45.523 --> 00:11:46.577
(Laughter)

00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:49.359
And then he said,
"Why would they vote for him?"

00:11:50.232 --> 00:11:51.948
And I remember stopping and thinking

00:11:51.972 --> 00:11:54.772
that it was really important
how I answered this question.

00:11:55.409 --> 00:11:58.171
Somehow, I had to honor
our own family values

00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:00.004
and show respect for our friends.

00:12:00.697 --> 00:12:02.269
So I finally said,

00:12:02.293 --> 00:12:04.961
"They think that's the right direction
for this country."

00:12:04.985 --> 00:12:07.779
And before I had even gotten
the whole sentence out,

00:12:07.803 --> 00:12:10.946
he had moved on to the soccer game
he was going to play at recess.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.142
CQ: So life with boys.

00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:13.199
(Laughter)

00:12:13.223 --> 00:12:16.583
So what Lauran and I have discovered
through our bipartisan friendship

00:12:16.607 --> 00:12:19.587
is the possibility that lives in dialogue.

00:12:19.611 --> 00:12:21.953
We have chosen to be genuinely curious

00:12:21.977 --> 00:12:24.655
about each other's ideas and perspectives

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:28.499
and to be willing to listen to one another
even when we disagree.

00:12:28.523 --> 00:12:31.648
And by putting aside our ego
and our preconceived ideas,

00:12:31.672 --> 00:12:34.235
we've opened ourselves up
to limitless learning.

00:12:34.602 --> 00:12:37.404
And perhaps most importantly
for our relationship,

00:12:37.428 --> 00:12:39.460
we have made the commitment to each other

00:12:39.484 --> 00:12:42.349
that our friendship is way more important

00:12:42.373 --> 00:12:46.483
than either of us being right
or winning a conversation about politics.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.201
So today, we're asking you
to have a conversation.

00:12:50.225 --> 00:12:52.492
Talk to someone outside
of your political party

00:12:52.516 --> 00:12:54.137
who might challenge your thinking.

00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:55.986
Make an effort to engage with someone

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.979
with whom you might typically
avoid a political conversation.

00:12:59.003 --> 00:13:01.868
But remember, the goal isn't to win,

00:13:01.892 --> 00:13:04.530
the goal is to listen and to understand

00:13:04.554 --> 00:13:06.804
and to be open to learning something new.

00:13:07.587 --> 00:13:09.550
LA: So let's go back to election night.

00:13:09.884 --> 00:13:11.147
As the polls were closing

00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:14.480
and it became clear that Trump
was going to be our new president,

00:13:14.504 --> 00:13:15.702
I was devastated.

00:13:16.485 --> 00:13:19.116
I was sad, I was confused,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.924
and I'll be honest -- I was angry.

00:13:21.873 --> 00:13:23.556
And then just before midnight,

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.937
I received this text message from Caitlin.

00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:29.333
[I know this is a hard night for you guys.

00:13:29.357 --> 00:13:32.461
We are thinking of you. Love you.]

00:13:32.485 --> 00:13:36.295
And where there so easy could have been
weeks or months of awkwardness

00:13:36.319 --> 00:13:39.278
and unspoken hostility, there was this --

00:13:40.002 --> 00:13:42.620
an offering of empathy
rooted in friendship.

00:13:43.554 --> 00:13:46.507
And I knew, in that moment,
that we would make it through this.

00:13:47.512 --> 00:13:51.128
CQ: So we must find a way
to engage in meaningful conversations

00:13:51.152 --> 00:13:53.504
that are going to move us
forward as a nation,

00:13:53.528 --> 00:13:54.949
and we can no longer wait

00:13:54.973 --> 00:13:58.352
for our elected officials
to elevate our national discourse.

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:02.107
LA: The challenges ahead
are going to require all of us

00:14:02.131 --> 00:14:05.035
to participate in a deeper
and more meaningful way ...

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.048
and it starts with each one of us

00:14:08.072 --> 00:14:10.231
building connection through dialogue --

00:14:10.255 --> 00:14:13.922
in our relationships, our communities

00:14:13.946 --> 00:14:15.096
and as a country.

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:17.150
Thank you.

00:14:17.174 --> 00:14:24.034
(Applause)
