00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.339
I want to talk to you about something

00:00:18.363 --> 00:00:19.601
kind of big.

00:00:21.942 --> 00:00:23.156
We'll start here.

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:26.786
Sixty-five million years ago --

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.847
(Laughter)

00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:30.910
the dinosaurs had a bad day.

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:33.545
(Laughter)

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:36.844
A chunk of rock six miles across,

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:40.609
moving something like 50 times
the speed of a rifle bullet,

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.414
slammed into the Earth.

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:44.894
It released its energy all at once,

00:00:44.918 --> 00:00:48.446
and it was an explosion
that was mind-numbing.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.331
If you took every
nuclear weapon ever built

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:52.914
at the height of the Cold War,

00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:54.310
lumped them together,

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:56.836
and blew them up at the same time,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.569
that would be one one-millionth
of the energy released at that moment.

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:05.746
The dinosaurs had a really bad day.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.935
OK?

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:09.300
Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.

00:01:09.324 --> 00:01:10.689
We all live here in Boulder.

00:01:10.713 --> 00:01:13.113
If you look out your window
and see Longs Peak --

00:01:13.137 --> 00:01:14.852
you're probably familiar with it --

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:17.889
now, scoop up Longs Peak
and put it out in space.

00:01:17.913 --> 00:01:20.598
Take ... Meeker, Mt. Meeker.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:23.359
Lump that in there,
and put that in space as well.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:26.411
And Mt. Everest. And K2.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:27.998
And the Indian peaks.

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:31.886
Then you're starting to get an idea
of how much rock we're talking about, OK?

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.087
We know it was that big

00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:35.947
because of the impact it had
and the crater it left.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:39.936
It hit in what we now know
as Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.570
You can see here,
there's the Yucatan Peninsula,

00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:44.967
if you recognize Cozumel
off the east coast there.

00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:47.707
Here is how big of a crater was left.

00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:48.904
It was huge.

00:01:48.928 --> 00:01:51.516
To give you a sense
of the scale ... there you go.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.533
The scale here is 50 miles on top,
a hundred kilometers on the bottom.

00:01:55.557 --> 00:01:58.609
This thing was 300 kilometers
across -- 200 miles --

00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:02.210
an enormous crater that excavated
out vast amounts of earth

00:02:02.234 --> 00:02:06.805
that splashed around the globe
and set fires all over the planet,

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.074
threw up enough dust to block out the sun.

00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:13.444
It wiped out 75 percent
of all species on Earth.

00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:16.356
Now, not all asteroids are that big.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.705
Some of them are smaller.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.469
Here is one that came in

00:02:21.493 --> 00:02:25.848
over the United States in October of 1992.

00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:27.608
It came in on a Friday night.

00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:28.888
Why is that important?

00:02:28.912 --> 00:02:32.684
Because back then, video cameras
were just starting to become popular,

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:36.660
and parents would bring them
to their kids' football games

00:02:36.684 --> 00:02:38.507
to film their kids playing football.

00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:40.658
And since this came in on a Friday,

00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:44.123
they were able to get this great footage
of this thing breaking up

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:47.602
as it came in over West Virginia,
Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:48.936
until it did that

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.390
to a car in New York.

00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:51.990
(Laughter)

00:02:52.014 --> 00:02:55.512
Now, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater,

00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:59.017
but then again, you can see the rock,
which is sitting right here,

00:02:59.041 --> 00:03:00.435
about the size of a football,

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.841
that hit that car and did that damage.

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:05.676
Now, this thing was probably
about the size of a school bus

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.857
when it first came in.

00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:08.858
It broke up through atmospheric pressure,

00:03:08.882 --> 00:03:10.981
it crumbled, and then
the pieces fell apart

00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:12.489
and did some damage.

00:03:12.513 --> 00:03:16.439
Now, you wouldn't want that falling
on your foot or your head,

00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:17.959
because it would do that to it.

00:03:17.983 --> 00:03:19.936
That would be bad.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.224
But it won't wipe out, you know,
all life on Earth, so that's fine.

00:03:23.248 --> 00:03:26.936
But it turns out, you don't need
something six miles across

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.203
to do a lot of damage.

00:03:28.227 --> 00:03:31.922
There is a median point
between tiny rock and gigantic rock,

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:35.814
and in fact, if any of you
have ever been to near Winslow, Arizona,

00:03:35.838 --> 00:03:39.357
there is a crater in the desert
there that is so iconic

00:03:39.381 --> 00:03:41.941
that it is actually
called "Meteor Crater."

00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:44.942
To give you a sense of scale,
this is about a mile wide.

00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:48.205
If you look up at the top,
that's a parking lot,

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.123
and those are recreational
vehicles right there.

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:54.221
So it's about a mile across,
600 feet deep.

00:03:54.245 --> 00:03:59.670
The object that formed this
was probably about 30 to 50 yards across,

00:03:59.694 --> 00:04:03.388
so roughly the size
of Macky Auditorium here.

00:04:03.412 --> 00:04:05.991
It came in at speeds that were tremendous,

00:04:06.015 --> 00:04:08.339
slammed into the ground, blew up,

00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:12.156
and exploded with the energy of roughly
a 20-megaton nuclear bomb --

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.747
a very hefty bomb.

00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:15.881
This was 50,000 years ago,

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:18.775
so it may have wiped out
a few buffalo or antelope,

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.357
or something like that out in the desert,

00:04:21.381 --> 00:04:25.182
but it probably would not have caused
global devastation.

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:28.829
It turns out that these things
don't have to hit the ground

00:04:28.853 --> 00:04:30.436
to do a lot of damage.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.317
Now, in 1908, over Siberia,
near the Tunguska region --

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:37.522
for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans
and saw "Ghostbusters,"

00:04:37.546 --> 00:04:40.182
when he talked about the greatest
cross-dimensional rift

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:42.140
since the Siberia blast of 1909,

00:04:42.164 --> 00:04:44.773
where he got the date
wrong, but that's OK.

00:04:44.797 --> 00:04:45.909
(Laughter)

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:48.200
It was 1908. That's fine.
I can live with that.

00:04:48.224 --> 00:04:50.057
(Laughter)

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:53.156
Another rock came
into the Earth's atmosphere

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.372
and this one blew up above the ground,

00:04:55.396 --> 00:04:57.709
several miles up
above the surface of the Earth.

00:04:57.733 --> 00:05:02.909
The heat from the explosion
set fire to the forest below it,

00:05:02.933 --> 00:05:06.110
and then the shock wave came down
and knocked down trees

00:05:06.134 --> 00:05:08.952
for hundreds of square miles.

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:10.953
This did a huge amount of damage.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.722
And again, this was a rock
probably roughly the size

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.824
of this auditorium that we're sitting in.

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:17.825
In Meteor Crater, it was made of metal,

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.493
and metal is much tougher,
so it made it to the ground.

00:05:20.517 --> 00:05:22.824
The one over Tunguska
was probably made of rock,

00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:25.642
and that's much more crumbly,
so it blew up in the air.

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:30.351
Either way, these are tremendous
explosions -- 20 megatons.

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:32.424
Now, when these things blow up,

00:05:32.448 --> 00:05:35.835
they're not going to do
global ecological damage.

00:05:35.859 --> 00:05:39.027
They're not going to do
something like the dinosaur killer did.

00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:40.520
They're just not big enough.

00:05:40.544 --> 00:05:43.230
But they will do global economic damage,

00:05:43.254 --> 00:05:45.772
because they don't have
to hit, necessarily,

00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:47.305
to do this kind of damage.

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:49.936
They don't have to do global devastation.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.772
If one of these things were to hit
pretty much anywhere,

00:05:52.796 --> 00:05:53.951
it would cause a panic.

00:05:53.975 --> 00:05:56.240
But if it came over a city,
an important city --

00:05:56.264 --> 00:05:58.528
not that any city
is more important than others,

00:05:58.552 --> 00:06:01.891
but some of them we depend on more
on the global economic basis --

00:06:01.915 --> 00:06:07.121
that could do a huge amount of damage
to us as a civilization.

00:06:07.145 --> 00:06:10.667
So, now that I've scared
the crap out of you --

00:06:10.691 --> 00:06:11.796
(Laughter)

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.797
what can we do about this?

00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:15.908
This is a potential threat.

00:06:15.932 --> 00:06:20.318
Let me note that we have not had
a giant impact like the dinosaur killer

00:06:20.342 --> 00:06:21.629
for 65 million years.

00:06:21.653 --> 00:06:22.990
They're very rare.

00:06:23.014 --> 00:06:25.133
The smaller ones happen more often,

00:06:25.157 --> 00:06:27.684
but probably on the order of a millennium,

00:06:27.708 --> 00:06:31.084
every few centuries
or every few thousand years.

00:06:31.108 --> 00:06:33.160
But it's still something to be aware of.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.724
Well, what do we do about them?

00:06:34.748 --> 00:06:36.855
The first thing
we have to do is find them.

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:41.121
This is an image of an asteroid
that passed us in 2009.

00:06:41.145 --> 00:06:42.942
It's right here.

00:06:42.966 --> 00:06:45.437
But you can see that it's extremely faint.

00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:47.794
I don't know if you can see that
in the back row.

00:06:47.818 --> 00:06:49.233
These are just stars.

00:06:49.257 --> 00:06:51.490
This is a rock
that was about 30 yards across,

00:06:51.514 --> 00:06:54.393
so roughly the size of the ones
that blew up over Tunguska

00:06:54.417 --> 00:06:56.643
and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago.

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:57.829
These things are faint.

00:06:57.853 --> 00:07:00.279
They're hard to see,
and the sky is really big.

00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:02.223
We have to find these things first.

00:07:02.247 --> 00:07:04.526
Well, the good news is,
we're looking for them.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.843
NASA has devoted money to this;

00:07:06.867 --> 00:07:09.268
the National Science Foundation
and other countries

00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:10.707
are interested in doing this.

00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:13.484
We're building telescopes
that are looking for the threat.

00:07:13.508 --> 00:07:16.074
That's a great first step.
But what's the second step?

00:07:16.098 --> 00:07:19.546
The second step is if we see one heading
toward us, we have to stop it.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:20.721
What do we do?

00:07:20.745 --> 00:07:23.097
You've probably heard
about the asteroid Apophis.

00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:25.261
If you haven't yet, you will.

00:07:25.285 --> 00:07:27.950
If you've heard about the Mayan
2012 apocalypse,

00:07:27.974 --> 00:07:29.666
you're going to hear about Apophis,

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.983
because you're keyed in
to all the doomsday networks, anyway.

00:07:33.007 --> 00:07:34.715
(Laughter)

00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:37.761
Apophis is an asteroid
that was discovered in 2004.

00:07:37.785 --> 00:07:41.517
It's roughly 250 [meters] across,
so it's pretty big --

00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:43.850
bigger than a football stadium.

00:07:43.874 --> 00:07:47.370
And it's going to pass
by the Earth in April of 2029.

00:07:47.394 --> 00:07:49.115
And it's going to pass us so close

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:52.854
that it's actually going to come
underneath our weather satellites.

00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:56.577
The Earth's gravity is going to bend
the orbit of this thing so much

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.003
that if it's just right,

00:07:58.027 --> 00:08:00.488
if it passes through this region of space,

00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:03.969
this kidney-bean-shaped region
called the keyhole,

00:08:03.993 --> 00:08:07.493
the Earth's gravity will bend it
just enough that seven years later,

00:08:07.517 --> 00:08:11.514
on April 13 -- which is a Friday,
I'll note -- in the year 2036 --

00:08:11.538 --> 00:08:12.561
(Laughter)

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:14.325
you can't plan that kind of stuff --

00:08:14.349 --> 00:08:15.411
(Laughter)

00:08:15.435 --> 00:08:16.913
Apophis is going to hit us.

00:08:16.937 --> 00:08:21.296
And it's 250 meters across,
so it would do unbelievable damage.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.917
The good news is that the odds of it
actually passing through this keyhole

00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:27.912
and hitting us next go-around
are one in a million, roughly --

00:08:27.936 --> 00:08:29.087
very, very low odds.

00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:32.517
So I personally am not lying awake
at night worrying about this at all.

00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:34.235
I don't think Apophis is a problem.

00:08:34.259 --> 00:08:36.527
In fact, Apophis
is a blessing in disguise,

00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:39.136
because it woke us up
to the dangers of these things.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.337
This thing was discovered
just a few years ago

00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:43.204
and could hit us a few years from now.

00:08:43.228 --> 00:08:46.842
It won't, but it gives us a chance
to study these kinds of asteroids.

00:08:46.866 --> 00:08:50.372
We didn't really necessarily understand
these keyholes, and now we do,

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:52.540
and it turns out that's really important,

00:08:52.564 --> 00:08:55.042
because how do you stop
an asteroid like this?

00:08:55.066 --> 00:08:56.588
Well, let me ask you:

00:08:56.612 --> 00:09:00.034
What happens if you're standing
in the road and a car's headed for you?

00:09:00.058 --> 00:09:01.228
What do you do?

00:09:01.252 --> 00:09:03.706
You do this. Right?
Move, and the car goes past you.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.050
But we can't move the Earth,
at least not easily,

00:09:06.074 --> 00:09:07.788
but we can move a small asteroid.

00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:10.007
And it turns out, we've even done it.

00:09:10.031 --> 00:09:13.992
In the year 2005, NASA launched
a probe called Deep Impact,

00:09:14.016 --> 00:09:18.477
which slammed a piece of itself
into the nucleus of a comet.

00:09:18.501 --> 00:09:20.370
Comets are very much like asteroids.

00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:22.513
The purpose wasn't to push it
out of the way;

00:09:22.537 --> 00:09:25.672
the purpose was to make a crater
to excavate the material

00:09:25.696 --> 00:09:28.251
and see what was underneath
the surface of this comet,

00:09:28.275 --> 00:09:29.971
which we learned quite a bit about.

00:09:29.995 --> 00:09:32.274
We did move the comet a little tiny bit --

00:09:32.298 --> 00:09:34.275
not very much, but that wasn't the point.

00:09:34.299 --> 00:09:36.136
However, think about this:

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.512
This thing is orbiting the Sun
at 10, 20 miles per second.

00:09:40.536 --> 00:09:43.235
We shot a space probe
at it and hit it, OK?

00:09:43.259 --> 00:09:45.890
Imagine how hard that must be,
and we did it.

00:09:45.914 --> 00:09:47.717
That means we can do it again.

00:09:47.741 --> 00:09:51.880
If we see an asteroid that's coming
toward us, headed right for us,

00:09:51.904 --> 00:09:53.586
and we have two years to go?

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.956
Boom! We hit it.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.503
You know, if you watch the movies --

00:09:57.527 --> 00:09:58.585
(Laughter)

00:09:58.609 --> 00:09:59.761
you might think:

00:09:59.785 --> 00:10:01.422
Why don't we use a nuclear weapon?

00:10:01.446 --> 00:10:03.799
Well, you can try that,
but the problem is timing.

00:10:03.823 --> 00:10:05.613
Shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing,

00:10:05.637 --> 00:10:08.569
you have to blow it up
within a few milliseconds of tolerance,

00:10:08.593 --> 00:10:09.769
or else you'll miss it.

00:10:09.793 --> 00:10:13.094
And there are a lot of other problems
with that; it's very hard to do.

00:10:13.118 --> 00:10:15.321
But just hitting something?
That's pretty easy.

00:10:15.345 --> 00:10:17.983
I think even NASA can do that,
and proved that they can.

00:10:18.007 --> 00:10:19.016
(Laughter)

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.469
The problem is, if you hit this asteroid,
you've changed the orbit,

00:10:22.493 --> 00:10:23.645
you measure the orbit,

00:10:23.669 --> 00:10:26.596
then you find out, oh yeah,
we just pushed it into a keyhole,

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.697
and now it's going to hit us
in three years.

00:10:28.721 --> 00:10:30.849
Well, my opinion is: fine!

00:10:30.873 --> 00:10:32.742
It's not hitting us in six months --

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:33.928
that's good.

00:10:33.952 --> 00:10:36.720
Now we have three years
to do something else.

00:10:36.744 --> 00:10:38.112
And you can hit it again.

00:10:38.136 --> 00:10:39.446
That's kind of ham-fisted;

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.139
you might just push it
into a third keyhole or whatever,

00:10:42.163 --> 00:10:43.336
so you don't do that.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.531
And this is the part --

00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:46.326
it's the part I just love.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.965
(Laughter)

00:10:48.989 --> 00:10:53.447
After the big macho "Grr ... bam!
We're gonna hit this thing in the face,"

00:10:53.471 --> 00:10:56.269
then we bring in the velvet gloves.

00:10:56.293 --> 00:10:58.136
(Laughter)

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.049
There's a group of scientists
and engineers and astronauts,

00:11:01.073 --> 00:11:03.506
and they call themselves
The B612 Foundation.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.876
For those of you who've read
"The Little Prince,"

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.868
you understand that reference, I hope --

00:11:07.892 --> 00:11:10.347
the little prince lived
on an asteroid called B612.

00:11:10.371 --> 00:11:14.083
These are smart guys -- men and women --
astronauts, like I said, engineers.

00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:17.367
Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9
astronaut, is on this.

00:11:17.391 --> 00:11:19.510
Dan Durda, my friend who made this image,

00:11:19.534 --> 00:11:23.441
works here at Southwest Research Institute
in Boulder, on Walnut Street.

00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:25.000
He created this image for this.

00:11:25.024 --> 00:11:27.678
He's actually one of the astronomers
who works for them.

00:11:27.702 --> 00:11:30.305
If we see an asteroid
that's going to hit the Earth

00:11:30.329 --> 00:11:32.042
and we have enough time,

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:34.421
we can hit it to move it
into a better orbit.

00:11:34.445 --> 00:11:39.246
But then what we do is launch a probe
that has to weigh a ton or two.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.256
It doesn't have to be huge --
a couple of tons, not that big --

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.993
and you park it near the asteroid.

00:11:44.017 --> 00:11:47.348
You don't land on it, because these things
are tumbling end over end.

00:11:47.372 --> 00:11:48.968
It's very hard to land on them.

00:11:48.992 --> 00:11:50.154
Instead you get near it.

00:11:50.178 --> 00:11:52.402
The gravity of the asteroid
pulls on the probe,

00:11:52.426 --> 00:11:54.450
and the probe
has a couple of tons of mass.

00:11:54.474 --> 00:11:56.207
It has a little tiny bit of gravity,

00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:59.460
but it's enough
that it can pull the asteroid,

00:11:59.484 --> 00:12:01.109
and you have your rocket set up --

00:12:01.133 --> 00:12:04.002
you can barely see it here,
but there's rocket plumes --

00:12:04.026 --> 00:12:07.400
and these guys are connected
by their own gravity,

00:12:07.424 --> 00:12:10.972
and if you move the probe
very slowly -- very, very gently,

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:16.019
you can very easily finesse that rock
into a safe orbit.

00:12:16.043 --> 00:12:19.168
You can even put in orbit
around the Earth where we could mine it,

00:12:19.192 --> 00:12:21.986
although that's a whole other thing;
I won't go into that.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.037
(Laughter)

00:12:23.061 --> 00:12:24.813
But we'd be rich!

00:12:24.837 --> 00:12:30.271
(Laughter)

00:12:30.295 --> 00:12:32.319
So think about this, right?

00:12:33.005 --> 00:12:36.293
There are these giant rocks flying
out there, and they're hitting us,

00:12:36.317 --> 00:12:37.839
and they're doing damage to us.

00:12:37.863 --> 00:12:39.672
But we've figured out how to do this,

00:12:39.696 --> 00:12:41.913
and all the pieces
are in place to do this.

00:12:41.937 --> 00:12:45.138
We have astronomers
with telescopes, looking for them.

00:12:45.162 --> 00:12:47.433
We have very, very smart people,

00:12:47.457 --> 00:12:50.849
who are concerned about this
and figuring out how to fix the problem,

00:12:50.873 --> 00:12:52.705
and we have the technology to do this.

00:12:52.729 --> 00:12:54.931
This probe actually can't use
chemical rockets.

00:12:54.955 --> 00:12:57.613
Chemical rockets provide
too much thrust, too much push.

00:12:57.637 --> 00:12:59.199
The probe would just shoot away.

00:12:59.223 --> 00:13:01.274
We invented something called an ion drive,

00:13:01.298 --> 00:13:03.852
which is a very, very,
very low-thrust engine.

00:13:03.876 --> 00:13:07.185
It generates the force a piece of paper
would have on your hand --

00:13:07.209 --> 00:13:11.173
incredibly light, but it can run
for months and years,

00:13:11.197 --> 00:13:13.527
providing that very gentle push.

00:13:13.551 --> 00:13:16.140
If anybody here is a fan
of the original "Star Trek,"

00:13:16.164 --> 00:13:18.959
they ran across an alien ship
that had an ion drive,

00:13:18.983 --> 00:13:21.675
and Spock said, "They're very
technically sophisticated.

00:13:21.699 --> 00:13:24.200
They're a hundred years
ahead of us with this drive."

00:13:24.224 --> 00:13:25.770
Yeah, we have an ion drive now.

00:13:25.794 --> 00:13:28.776
We don't have the Enterprise,
but we've got an ion drive now.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.746
(Laughter)

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.886
(Applause)

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.136
Spock.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.292
(Laughter)

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.513
So ...

00:13:39.048 --> 00:13:40.692
That's the difference --

00:13:40.716 --> 00:13:43.653
that's the difference
between us and the dinosaurs.

00:13:43.677 --> 00:13:45.119
This happened to them.

00:13:45.898 --> 00:13:47.713
It doesn't have to happen to us.

00:13:47.737 --> 00:13:50.895
The difference
between the dinosaurs and us

00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:53.034
is that we have a space program

00:13:53.058 --> 00:13:54.780
and we can vote,

00:13:54.804 --> 00:13:57.136
and so we can change our future.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.797
(Laughter)

00:13:58.821 --> 00:14:00.913
We have the ability to change our future.

00:14:00.937 --> 00:14:02.914
Sixty-five million years from now,

00:14:02.938 --> 00:14:06.842
we don't have to have our bones
collecting dust in a museum.

00:14:06.866 --> 00:14:08.034
Thank you very much.

00:14:08.058 --> 00:14:11.064
(Applause)
