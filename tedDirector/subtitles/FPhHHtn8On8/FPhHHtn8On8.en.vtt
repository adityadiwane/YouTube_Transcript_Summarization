Hetain Patel: (In Chinese)

00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:26.606
Yuyu Rau: Hi, I'm Hetain. I'm an artist.

00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:28.467
And this is Yuyu,

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.886
who is a dancer I have been working with.

00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:34.492
I have asked her to translate for me.

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:39.182
HP: (In Chinese)

00:00:39.182 --> 00:00:41.890
YR: If I may, I would like to tell you

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.620
a little bit about myself

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.916
and my artwork.

00:00:45.916 --> 00:00:51.459
HP: (In Chinese)

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:54.583
YR: I was born and raised near Manchester,

00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:55.550
in England,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.122
but I'm not going to say it in English to you,

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:01.883
because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions

00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:04.965
that might be made from my northern accent.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:07.540
(Laughter)

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:16.975
HP: (In Chinese)

00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:19.487
YR: The only problem with masking it

00:01:19.487 --> 00:01:21.037
with Chinese Mandarin

00:01:21.037 --> 00:01:23.755
is I can only speak this paragraph,

00:01:23.755 --> 00:01:25.534
which I have learned by heart

00:01:25.534 --> 00:01:28.204
when I was visiting in China. (Laughter)

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:32.092
So all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.952
and hope you won't notice.

00:01:33.952 --> 00:01:39.301
(Laughter)

00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:43.481
HP: (In Chinese)

00:01:43.481 --> 00:01:44.848
(Laughter)

00:01:44.848 --> 00:01:47.961
YR: Needless to say, I would like to apologize

00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:52.444
to any Mandarin speakers in the audience.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.887
As a child, I would hate being made

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:59.515
to wear the Indian kurta pajama,

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:02.513
because I didn't think it was very cool.

00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:05.814
It felt a bit girly to me, like a dress,

00:02:05.814 --> 00:02:08.472
and it had this baggy trouser part

00:02:08.472 --> 00:02:10.715
you had to tie really tight

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:14.139
to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down.

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.175
My dad never wore it,

00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:19.100
so I didn't see why I had to.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.453
Also, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable,

00:02:22.453 --> 00:02:25.148
that people assume I represent something

00:02:25.148 --> 00:02:27.474
genuinely Indian when I wear it,

00:02:27.474 --> 00:02:30.923
because that's not how I feel.

00:02:30.923 --> 00:02:36.775
HP: (In Chinese)

00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:39.702
YR: Actually, the only way I feel comfortable

00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:42.110
wearing it is by pretending

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.321
they are the robes of a kung fu warrior

00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:48.060
like Li Mu Bai from that film,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.373
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."

00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:57.556
(Music)

00:03:35.383 --> 00:03:36.992
Okay.

00:03:36.992 --> 00:03:44.063
So my artwork is about identity and language,

00:03:44.063 --> 00:03:46.793
challenging common assumptions

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:51.338
based on how we look like or where we come from,

00:03:51.338 --> 00:03:55.082
gender, race, class.

00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:58.933
What makes us who we are anyway?

00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:04.880
HP: (In Chinese)

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.256
YR: I used to read Spider-Man comics,

00:04:07.256 --> 00:04:08.831
watch kung fu movies,

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:11.616
take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee.

00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:13.265
He would say things like --

00:04:13.265 --> 00:04:15.352
HP: Empty your mind.

00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:16.416
(Laughter)

00:04:16.416 --> 00:04:22.429
Be formless, shapeless, like water.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.419
Now you put water into a cup.

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.315
It becomes the cup.

00:04:27.315 --> 00:04:30.422
You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.

00:04:30.422 --> 00:04:33.801
Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.

00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:36.450
Now, water can flow

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.100
or it can crash.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.455
Be water, my friend. (Applause)

00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:46.557
YR: This year, I am 32 years old,

00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:49.676
the same age Bruce Lee was when he died.

00:04:49.676 --> 00:04:52.270
I have been wondering recently,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.200
if he were alive today,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.226
what advice he would give me

00:04:56.226 --> 00:05:00.170
about making this TED Talk.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.908
HP: Don't imitate my voice.

00:05:03.908 --> 00:05:05.979
It offends me.

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.009
(Laughter)

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.760
YR: Good advice,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.472
but I still think that we learn who we are

00:05:13.472 --> 00:05:15.575
by copying others.

00:05:15.575 --> 00:05:19.792
Who here hasn't imitated their childhood hero

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:23.687
in the playground, or mum or father?

00:05:23.687 --> 00:05:25.948
I have.

00:05:25.948 --> 00:05:30.490
HP: A few years ago, in order to make this video

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.495
for my artwork, I shaved off all my hair

00:05:34.495 --> 00:05:37.638
so that I could grow it back as my father had it

00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:40.404
when he first emigrated from India

00:05:40.404 --> 00:05:43.668
to the U.K. in the 1960s.

00:05:43.668 --> 00:05:47.798
He had a side parting and a neat mustache.

00:05:47.798 --> 00:05:50.417
At first, it was going very well.

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:53.467
I even started to get discounts in Indian shops.

00:05:53.467 --> 00:05:57.468
(Laughter)

00:05:57.468 --> 00:05:59.092
But then very quickly,

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:00.839
I started to underestimate

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.519
my mustache growing ability,

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:05.921
and it got way too big.

00:06:05.921 --> 00:06:08.668
It didn't look Indian anymore.

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:10.511
Instead, people from across the road,

00:06:10.511 --> 00:06:12.402
they would shout things like --

00:06:12.402 --> 00:06:14.618
HP and YR: Arriba! Arriba! Ándale! Ándale!

00:06:14.618 --> 00:06:16.619
(Laughter)

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:18.983
HP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this.

00:06:18.983 --> 00:06:21.987
My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore.

00:06:21.987 --> 00:06:24.514
He talks like this now.

00:06:24.514 --> 00:06:28.542
So it's not just my father that I've imitated.

00:06:28.542 --> 00:06:32.140
A few years ago I went to China for a few months,

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.974
and I couldn't speak Chinese,

00:06:34.974 --> 00:06:36.786
and this frustrated me,

00:06:36.786 --> 00:06:40.738
so I wrote about this and had it translated

00:06:40.738 --> 00:06:47.225
into Chinese, and then I learned this by heart,

00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:50.422
like music, I guess.

00:06:50.422 --> 00:06:53.763
YR: This phrase is now etched into my mind

00:06:53.763 --> 00:06:56.642
clearer than the pin number to my bank card,

00:06:56.642 --> 00:07:00.570
so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.618
When I had learned this phrase,

00:07:02.618 --> 00:07:05.354
I had an artist over there hear me out

00:07:05.354 --> 00:07:07.823
to see how accurate it sounded.

00:07:07.823 --> 00:07:10.309
I spoke the phrase, and then he laughed

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:13.120
and told me, "Oh yeah, that's great,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.493
only it kind of sounds like a woman."

00:07:15.493 --> 00:07:16.955
I said, "What?"

00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:20.877
He said, "Yeah, you learned from a woman?"

00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:22.881
I said, "Yes. So?"

00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:25.522
He then explained the tonal differences

00:07:25.522 --> 00:07:27.772
between male and female voices

00:07:27.772 --> 00:07:31.574
are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well,

00:07:31.574 --> 00:07:33.567
but in a woman's voice.

00:07:33.567 --> 00:07:35.790
(Laughter)

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:43.100
(Applause)

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.519
HP: Okay. So this imitation business

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:48.204
does come with risk.

00:07:48.204 --> 00:07:50.912
It doesn't always go as you plan it,

00:07:50.912 --> 00:07:54.382
even with a talented translator.

00:07:54.382 --> 00:07:56.668
But I am going to stick with it,

00:07:56.668 --> 00:08:01.033
because contrary to what we might usually assume,

00:08:01.033 --> 00:08:05.132
imitating somebody can reveal something unique.

00:08:05.132 --> 00:08:08.387
So every time I fail

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.943
to become more like my father,

00:08:10.943 --> 00:08:14.838
I become more like myself.

00:08:14.838 --> 00:08:19.420
Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee,

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.066
I become more authentically me.

00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:24.551
This is my art.

00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:27.871
I strive for authenticity,

00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:30.106
even if it comes in a shape

00:08:30.106 --> 00:08:33.802
that we might not usually expect.

00:08:33.802 --> 00:08:38.038
It's only recently that I've started to understand

00:08:38.038 --> 00:08:41.745
that I didn't learn to sit like this

00:08:41.745 --> 00:08:43.891
through being Indian.

00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:47.167
I learned this from Spider-Man.

00:08:47.167 --> 00:08:48.905
(Laughter)

00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:50.462
Thank you.

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:56.478
(Applause)
