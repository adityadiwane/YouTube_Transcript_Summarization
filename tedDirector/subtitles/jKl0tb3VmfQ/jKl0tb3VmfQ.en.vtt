00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
Okay, so

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.330
90 percent of my photographic process

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
is, in fact, not photographic.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
It involves a campaign of letter writing,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
research and phone calls

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
to access my subjects,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
to a hibernating black bear in its cave

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
in West Virginia.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
And oddly, the most notable

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
letter of rejection I ever received

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
came from Walt Disney World,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
a seemingly innocuous site.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
And it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence:

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
"Especially during these violent times,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
I personally believe

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.330
that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
is particularly important to protect

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
and helps to provide them with an important fantasy

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
they can escape to."

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
Photography threatens fantasy.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
They didn't want to let my camera in

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.330
because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
and provides what appears to be

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
evidence of a truth.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
But there are multiple truths attached to every image,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
depending on the creator's intention, the viewer

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
and the context in which it is presented.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
Over a five year period following September 11th,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
when the American media and government were seeking

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
hidden and unknown sites

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
beyond its borders,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
most notably weapons of mass destruction,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
I chose to look inward at that which was integral

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
to America's foundation,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
mythology and daily functioning.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
self-imposed and real,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
and confront the divide between privileged

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.330
and public access to knowledge.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
It was a critical moment in American history

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
and global history

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.330
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
but what I came away with is a photograph.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
And it's just another place from which to observe,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
and the understanding that

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.330
there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.330
And the outsider can never really reach the core.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.330
I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
It's titled, "An American Index

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
of the Hidden and Unfamiliar,"

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
and it's comprised of nearly 70 images.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
In this context I'll just show you a few.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.330
This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
at Hanford site in Washington State,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
where there are over 1,900

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
submerged in water.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.330
A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
And I found one section amongst all of these

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
that actually resembled the outline

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
of the United States of America,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
which you can see here.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
And a big part of the work that is

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.330
sort of absent in this context is text.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
So I create these two poles.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.330
Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
And what I'm most interested in

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
is the invisible space between a text

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
and its accompanying image,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
and how the image is transformed by the text

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
and the text by the image.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
So, at best, the image is meant to float away

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.330
into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330
And then the text functions as this cruel anchor

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
that kind of nails it to the ground.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
But in this context I'm just going to read

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
an abridged version of those texts.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
This is a cryopreservation unit,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.330
in good health, with advancements in science and technology,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.330
all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
undergoing hymenoplasty.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.330
Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
regarding virginity and marriage.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.330
allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
to simulate the loss of virginity.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
This is a jury simulation deliberation room,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
and you can see beyond that two-way mirror

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.330
jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
And they observe deliberations

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
after mock trial proceedings

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.330
so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
to have the outcome that they're hoping for.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.330
This process costs 60,000 dollars.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.330
This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
a contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
On that table you can see 48 hours' worth

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.330
of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.330
There is a pig's head and African cane rats.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
And part of my photographic work

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
is I'm not just documenting what's there.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
I do take certain liberties and intervene.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
And in this I really wanted it to resemble

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
an early still-life painting,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.330
so I spent some time with the smells and items.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
in Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
And the CIA has had a long history

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.330
with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
was designed to counter Soviet communism

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
and promote what it considered to be pro-American

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
thoughts and aesthetics.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.330
And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.330
and had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.330
This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
and on a six acre plot

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.330
there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
that are being studied by forensic anthropologists

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
and researchers who are interested in monitoring

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
a rate of corpse decomposition.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.330
has been used to reenact a crime scene.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
This is the only federally funded site

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
where it is legal to cultivate cannabis

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
for scientific research in the United States.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
It's a research crop marijuana grow room.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
And part of the work that I hope for

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.330
is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.330
where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things --

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.330
they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.330
to religion to security --

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.330
and you can't completely understand

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.330
how information is being distributed.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.330
These are transatlantic submarine communication cables

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
connecting North America to Europe.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.330
They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
and in a lot of the government and technology sites

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
there was just this very apparent vulnerability.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.330
But stuff did feel like it could have been taken

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.330
30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
and hadn't necessarily progressed.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
(Laughter)

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.330
produces a free national library service

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
for the blind and visually impaired,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
and the publications they choose to publish

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
are based on reader popularity.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
And Playboy is always in the top few.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
(Laughter)

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.330
But you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs. It's just the text.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.330
(Laughter)

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
This is an avian quarantine facility

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
where all imported birds coming into America

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
where they are tested for diseases

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
including Exotic Newcastle Disease

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.330
and Avian Influenza.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.330
This film shows

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.330
the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
And the Air Armament Center

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
is responsible for the deployment and testing

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
of all air-delivered weaponry

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.330
coming from the United States.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.330
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.330
And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
All living white tigers in North America

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
are the result of selective inbreeding --

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
that would be mother to son,

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.330
father to daughter, sister to brother --

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.330
to allow for the genetic conditions

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
that create a salable white tiger.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.330
Meaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.330
And the majority of these white tigers

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
are not born in a salable state

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
and are killed at birth.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
It's a very violent process that is little known.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:23.330
And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.330
Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
He has since passed away,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
but was mentally retarded

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.330
and suffers from severe bone abnormalities.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
This, on a lighter note, is at

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
George Lucas' personal archive.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
This is the Death Star.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.330
And it's shown here in its true orientation.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
In the context of "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,"

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
its mirror image is presented.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
They flip the negative.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.330
And you can see the photoetched brass detailing,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.330
and the painted acrylic facade.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.330
In the context of the film,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.330
this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire,

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.330
capable of annihilating planets and civilizations,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.330
(Laughter)

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.330
It's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.330
Essentially they've simulated a city

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
for urban combat,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
and this is one of the structures that exists in that city.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.330
It's called the World Church of God.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
It's supposed to be a generic site of worship.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.330
And after I took this photograph,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.330
they constructed a wall around the World Church of God

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:40.330
to mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.330
And I worked with Mehta Vihar

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.330
who creates virtual simulations for the army

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
for tactical practice.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
And we put that wall around the World Church of God,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.330
and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
that are offered in the video games for the army.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.330
And I put them into my photograph.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
This is live HIV virus

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
at Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.330
to develop sterilizing immunity.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.330
And Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
Arabic language television network

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:19.330
that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.330
It runs 24 hours a day, commercial free.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:27.330
However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.330
And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.330
which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
and is broadcast to Iraq.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
Now I'm going to move on to another project I did.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.330
It's titled "The Innocents."

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
And for the men in these photographs,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
photography had been used to create a fantasy.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.330
Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.330
in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
I traveled across the United States

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.330
of crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.330
I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
and its influence on memory,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.330
which can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
For the men in these photographs,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
the primary cause of their wrongful conviction

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
was mistaken identification.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
A victim or eyewitness identifies

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.330
a suspected perpetrator

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.330
through law enforcement's use of images.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
But through exposure to composite sketches,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
Polaroids, mug shots and line-ups,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
eyewitness testimony can change.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
I'll give you an example from a case.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.330
A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
from which to identify her attacker.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.330
She saw some similarities in one of the photographs,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.330
but couldn't quite make a positive identification.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.330
Days later, she is presented with another photo array

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
of all new photographs,

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
except that one photograph that she had some draw to

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
from the earlier array is repeated in the second array.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
And a positive identification is made

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.330
because the photograph replaced the memory,

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.330
if there ever was an actual memory.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.330
Photography offered the criminal justice system

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.330
a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.330
and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.330
of relying on photographic identifications.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.330
Frederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location,

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.330
where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.330
He was convicted by an all-white jury

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.330
of rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.330
And he served 10 years of a life sentence.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
Now DNA exonerated Frederick

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
and it also implicated another man

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
who was serving time in prison.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.330
But the victim refused to press charges

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
because she claimed that law enforcement

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:53.330
had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.330
Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
of a young girl walking to school.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.330
He served 18 years of a death sentence.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
I photographed him at the scene of the crime

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
at the Snake River in Idaho.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.330
And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:15.330
at sites that came to particular significance

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
in the history of their wrongful conviction.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
the alibi location.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.330
to which he's never been, but changed his life forever.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
So photographing there, I was hoping to highlight

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:37.330
in both his life and in photography.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.330
Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:45.330
He served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
Larry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
where he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana,

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:54.330
in this very room to hide from the police.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.330
He ended up serving 18 and a half years

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.330
of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.330
The victim failed to identify Larry

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.330
in two live lineups

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.330
and then made a positive identification, days later,

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.330
from a photo array.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.330
Larry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.330
in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.330
of a 10 year old boy at a carnival.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.330
He is photographed at his alibi location.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.330
Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
of a barmaid at a club,

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.330
and served 11 years of a death sentence.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.330
I photographed Ron at a baseball field

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.330
because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:40.330
to play professional baseball just before his conviction.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.330
And the state's key witness in Ron's case

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:48.330
was, in the end, the actual perpetrator.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.330
Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:59.330
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.330
William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:08.330
He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.330
Timothy Durham, who I photographed at his alibi location

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.330
where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime,

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.330
was convicted of 3.5 years

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:21.330
of a 3220 year sentence,

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.330
for several charges of rape and robbery.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:28.330
He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.330
Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.330
He was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery,

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.330
and served seven years of a 47 year sentence.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.330
Troy's picture was in a photo array

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.330
that the victim tentatively had some draw toward,

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.330
but said he looked too old.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.330
The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.330
from four years earlier,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
which they entered into a photo array days later,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.330
and he was positively identified.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.330
Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.330
And it reiterates that distortion is a constant,

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.330
and our eyes are easily deceived.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.330
That's it. Thank you.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:29.330
(Applause)
