00:00:15.662 --> 00:00:20.671
I grew up in Bihar, India's poorest state,

00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:24.137
and I remember when I was six years old,

00:00:24.137 --> 00:00:27.903
I remember coming home one day to find a cart

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:33.224
full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep.

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:36.713
My brothers and I dug in,

00:00:36.713 --> 00:00:40.001
and that's when my father came home.

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:45.465
He was livid, and I still remember how we cried

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:49.529
when that cart with our half-eaten sweets

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:52.746
was pulled away from us.

00:00:52.746 --> 00:00:57.547
Later, I understood why my father got so upset.

00:00:57.547 --> 00:01:00.772
Those sweets were a bribe

00:01:00.772 --> 00:01:04.353
from a contractor who was trying to get my father

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:07.816
to award him a government contract.

00:01:07.816 --> 00:01:12.477
My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar,

00:01:12.477 --> 00:01:17.080
and he had developed a firm stance against corruption,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.128
even though he was harassed and threatened.

00:01:21.128 --> 00:01:24.496
His was a lonely struggle, because Bihar

00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:28.233
was also India's most corrupt state,

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:31.995
where public officials were enriching themselves,

00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:36.088
[rather] than serving the poor who had no means

00:01:36.088 --> 00:01:40.034
to express their anguish if their children

00:01:40.034 --> 00:01:43.867
had no food or no schooling.

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:48.224
And I experienced this most viscerally

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:54.522
when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty.

00:01:54.522 --> 00:01:58.339
And as I went village to village,

00:01:58.339 --> 00:02:04.851
I remember one day, when I was famished and exhausted,

00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:07.170
and I was almost collapsing

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.200
in a scorching heat under a tree,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.259
and just at that time, one of the poorest men in that village

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:22.175
invited me into his hut and graciously fed me.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:26.823
Only I later realized that what he fed me

00:02:26.823 --> 00:02:32.566
was food for his entire family for two days.

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:36.989
This profound gift of generosity

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.267
challenged and changed the very purpose of my life.

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:46.039
I resolved to give back.

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:50.343
Later, I joined the World Bank, which sought to fight

00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:56.111
such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries.

00:02:56.111 --> 00:03:01.143
My initial work focused on Uganda, where I focused

00:03:01.143 --> 00:03:05.371
on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda

00:03:05.371 --> 00:03:08.200
so they could access our loans.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.331
But after we disbursed the loans, I remember

00:03:11.331 --> 00:03:16.049
a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.833
without textbooks or teachers,

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:21.753
new health clinics without drugs,

00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:27.536
and the poor once again without any voice or recourse.

00:03:27.536 --> 00:03:31.112
It was Bihar all over again.

00:03:31.112 --> 00:03:35.072
Bihar represents the challenge of development:

00:03:35.072 --> 00:03:38.983
abject poverty surrounded by corruption.

00:03:38.983 --> 00:03:43.243
Globally, 1.3 billion people live on less than

00:03:43.243 --> 00:03:47.952
$1.25 a day, and the work I did in Uganda

00:03:47.952 --> 00:03:52.883
represents the traditional approach to these problems

00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:57.175
that has been practiced since 1944,

00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:02.795
when winners of World War II, 500 founding fathers,

00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:06.231
and one lonely founding mother,

00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:08.658
gathered in New Hampshire, USA,

00:04:08.658 --> 00:04:11.277
to establish the Bretton Woods institutions,

00:04:11.277 --> 00:04:13.082
including the World Bank.

00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:16.382
And that traditional approach to development

00:04:16.382 --> 00:04:20.318
had three key elements. First, transfer of resources

00:04:20.318 --> 00:04:22.269
from rich countries in the North

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:24.766
to poorer countries in the South,

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:27.659
accompanied by reform prescriptions.

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:31.225
Second, the development institutions that channeled

00:04:31.225 --> 00:04:35.987
these transfers were opaque, with little transparency

00:04:35.987 --> 00:04:39.787
of what they financed or what results they achieved.

00:04:39.787 --> 00:04:43.700
And third, the engagement in developing countries

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.982
was with a narrow set of government elites

00:04:46.982 --> 00:04:50.296
with little interaction with the citizens, who are

00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:54.581
the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance.

00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:58.782
Today, each of these elements is opening up

00:04:58.782 --> 00:05:02.142
due to dramatic changes in the global environment.

00:05:02.142 --> 00:05:05.837
Open knowledge, open aid, open governance,

00:05:05.837 --> 00:05:09.582
and together, they represent three key shifts

00:05:09.582 --> 00:05:12.352
that are transforming development

00:05:12.352 --> 00:05:16.065
and that also hold greater hope for the problems

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:20.638
I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.

00:05:20.638 --> 00:05:23.604
The first key shift is open knowledge.

00:05:23.604 --> 00:05:27.165
You know, developing countries today will not simply

00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:30.762
accept solutions that are handed down to them

00:05:30.762 --> 00:05:34.389
by the U.S., Europe or the World Bank.

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.224
They get their inspiration, their hope,

00:05:37.224 --> 00:05:39.624
their practical know-how,

00:05:39.624 --> 00:05:43.175
from successful emerging economies in the South.

00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:47.855
They want to know how China lifted 500 million people

00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:51.518
out of poverty in 30 years,

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.464
how Mexico's Oportunidades program

00:05:54.464 --> 00:05:59.160
improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.822
This is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows,

00:06:04.822 --> 00:06:09.755
not just traveling North to South, but South to South,

00:06:09.755 --> 00:06:12.058
and even South to North,

00:06:12.058 --> 00:06:17.800
with Mexico's Oportunidades today inspiring New York City.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.648
And just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up,

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:24.488
so too are the development institutions

00:06:24.488 --> 00:06:27.015
that channeled these transfers.

00:06:27.015 --> 00:06:30.884
This is the second shift: open aid.

00:06:30.884 --> 00:06:34.434
Recently, the World Bank opened its vault of data

00:06:34.434 --> 00:06:39.297
for public use, releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators

00:06:39.297 --> 00:06:43.666
for 200 countries over 50 years,

00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:47.644
and it launched a global competition to crowdsource

00:06:47.644 --> 00:06:51.311
innovative apps using this data.

00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:54.484
Development institutions today are also opening

00:06:54.484 --> 00:06:58.298
for public scrutiny the projects they finance.

00:06:58.298 --> 00:07:02.563
Take GeoMapping. In this map from Kenya,

00:07:02.563 --> 00:07:07.282
the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors

00:07:07.282 --> 00:07:11.274
are located, and the darker the shade of green,

00:07:11.274 --> 00:07:14.634
the more the number of out-of-school children.

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:18.770
So this simple mashup reveals that donors

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.746
have not financed any schools in the areas

00:07:21.746 --> 00:07:23.854
with the most out-of-school children,

00:07:23.854 --> 00:07:27.946
provoking new questions. Is development assistance

00:07:27.946 --> 00:07:32.565
targeting those who most need our help?

00:07:32.565 --> 00:07:35.467
In this manner, the World Bank has now GeoMapped

00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:40.409
30,000 project activities in 143 countries,

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:43.585
and donors are using a common platform

00:07:43.585 --> 00:07:46.530
to map all their projects.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:51.392
This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency

00:07:51.392 --> 00:07:54.234
and accountability of aid.

00:07:54.234 --> 00:07:57.230
And this leads me to the third, and in my view,

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.562
the most significant shift in development:

00:08:00.562 --> 00:08:04.777
open governance. Governments today are opening up

00:08:04.777 --> 00:08:08.754
just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:12.784
From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India,

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:15.518
using mobile phones and social media

00:08:15.518 --> 00:08:18.132
not just for political accountability

00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:22.277
but also for development accountability.

00:08:22.277 --> 00:08:26.749
Are governments delivering services to the citizens?

00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:30.894
So for instance, several governments in Africa

00:08:30.894 --> 00:08:35.918
and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public.

00:08:35.918 --> 00:08:39.321
But, you know, there is a big difference between a budget

00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:43.358
that's public and a budget that's accessible.

00:08:43.358 --> 00:08:48.278
This is a public budget. (Laughter)

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:51.383
And as you can see, it's not really accessible

00:08:51.383 --> 00:08:54.102
or understandable to an ordinary citizen

00:08:54.102 --> 00:08:59.100
that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.035
To tackle this problem, governments are using new tools

00:09:03.035 --> 00:09:07.718
to visualize the budget so it's more understandable

00:09:07.718 --> 00:09:09.918
to the public.

00:09:09.918 --> 00:09:13.852
In this map from Moldova, the green color shows

00:09:13.852 --> 00:09:17.940
those districts that have low spending on schools

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.260
but good educational outcomes,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.509
and the red color shows the opposite.

00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:30.036
Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:33.790
into a publicly understandable visual,

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.556
and what's exciting is that with this openness,

00:09:37.556 --> 00:09:41.414
there are today new opportunities for citizens

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.940
to give feedback and engage with government.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.323
So in the Philippines today, parents and students

00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:53.470
can give real-time feedback on a website,

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:58.562
Checkmyschool.org, or using SMS, whether teachers

00:09:58.562 --> 00:10:01.356
and textbooks are showing up in school,

00:10:01.356 --> 00:10:06.007
the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.

00:10:06.007 --> 00:10:08.859
And the government is responsive. So for instance,

00:10:08.859 --> 00:10:13.369
when it was reported on this website that 800 students

00:10:13.369 --> 00:10:17.555
were at risk because school repairs had stalled

00:10:17.555 --> 00:10:20.146
due to corruption, the Department of Education

00:10:20.146 --> 00:10:23.100
in the Philippines took swift action.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.797
And you know what's exciting is that this innovation

00:10:26.797 --> 00:10:31.459
is now spreading South to South, from the Philippines

00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:35.804
to Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova and beyond.

00:10:35.804 --> 00:10:40.063
In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, even an impoverished

00:10:40.063 --> 00:10:43.617
community was able to use these tools

00:10:43.617 --> 00:10:46.589
to voice its aspirations.

00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:49.508
This is what the map of Tandale looked like

00:10:49.508 --> 00:10:53.861
in August, 2011. But within a few weeks,

00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:58.327
university students were able to use mobile phones

00:10:58.327 --> 00:11:02.877
and an open-source platform to dramatically map

00:11:02.877 --> 00:11:06.364
the entire community infrastructure.

00:11:06.364 --> 00:11:10.829
And what is very exciting is that citizens were then

00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:15.836
able to give feedback as to which health or water points

00:11:15.836 --> 00:11:18.710
were not working, aggregated

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.310
in the red bubbles that you see,

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.908
which together provides a graphic visual

00:11:25.908 --> 00:11:30.363
of the collective voices of the poor.

00:11:30.363 --> 00:11:35.973
Today, even Bihar is turning around and opening up

00:11:35.973 --> 00:11:38.845
under a committed leadership that is making government

00:11:38.845 --> 00:11:44.013
transparent, accessible and responsive to the poor.

00:11:44.013 --> 00:11:47.541
But, you know, in many parts of the world,

00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:50.519
governments are not interested in opening up

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:55.636
or in serving the poor, and it is a real challenge

00:11:55.636 --> 00:11:59.980
for those who want to change the system.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.549
These are the lonely warriors

00:12:03.549 --> 00:12:07.013
like my father and many, many others,

00:12:07.013 --> 00:12:10.137
and a key frontier of development work

00:12:10.137 --> 00:12:15.333
is to help these lonely warriors join hands

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:18.874
so they can together overcome the odds.

00:12:18.874 --> 00:12:23.617
So for instance, today, in Ghana, courageous reformers

00:12:23.617 --> 00:12:26.817
from civil society, Parliament and government,

00:12:26.817 --> 00:12:31.009
have forged a coalition for transparent contracts

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:35.065
in the oil sector, and, galvanized by this,

00:12:35.065 --> 00:12:40.745
reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts.

00:12:40.745 --> 00:12:45.673
These examples give new hope, new possibility

00:12:45.673 --> 00:12:48.785
to the problems I witnessed in Uganda

00:12:48.785 --> 00:12:53.887
or that my father confronted in Bihar.

00:12:53.887 --> 00:13:00.856
Two years ago, on April 8th, 2010, I called my father.

00:13:00.856 --> 00:13:06.254
It was very late at night, and at age 80,

00:13:06.254 --> 00:13:11.055
he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation

00:13:11.055 --> 00:13:14.669
against corruption in a road project.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:19.287
Though he was no lawyer, he argued the case in court

00:13:19.287 --> 00:13:23.501
himself the next day. He won the ruling,

00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:25.523
but later that very evening,

00:13:25.523 --> 00:13:30.117
he fell, and he died.

00:13:30.117 --> 00:13:35.061
He fought till the end, increasingly passionate

00:13:35.061 --> 00:13:39.006
that to combat corruption and poverty,

00:13:39.006 --> 00:13:43.013
not only did government officials need to be honest,

00:13:43.013 --> 00:13:46.262
but citizens needed to join together

00:13:46.262 --> 00:13:49.157
to make their voices heard.

00:13:49.157 --> 00:13:54.018
These became the two bookends of his life,

00:13:54.018 --> 00:13:56.732
and the journey he traveled in between

00:13:56.732 --> 00:14:01.517
mirrored the changing development landscape.

00:14:01.517 --> 00:14:06.470
Today, I'm inspired by these changes, and I'm excited

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.574
that at the World Bank, we are embracing

00:14:09.574 --> 00:14:12.663
these new directions, a significant departure

00:14:12.663 --> 00:14:16.541
from my work in Uganda 20 years ago.

00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:20.082
We need to radically open up development

00:14:20.082 --> 00:14:22.886
so knowledge flows in multiple directions,

00:14:22.886 --> 00:14:27.677
inspiring practitioners, so aid becomes transparent,

00:14:27.677 --> 00:14:31.836
accountable and effective, so governments open up

00:14:31.836 --> 00:14:35.782
and citizens are engaged and empowered

00:14:35.782 --> 00:14:37.441
with reformers in government.

00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:40.638
We need to accelerate these shifts.

00:14:40.638 --> 00:14:45.638
If we do, we will find that the collective voices

00:14:45.638 --> 00:14:50.028
of the poor will be heard in Bihar,

00:14:50.028 --> 00:14:52.250
in Uganda, and beyond.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.325
We will find that textbooks and teachers

00:14:56.325 --> 00:14:59.362
will show up in schools for their children.

00:14:59.362 --> 00:15:03.445
We will find that these children, too,

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:09.563
have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty.

00:15:09.563 --> 00:15:12.778
Thank you. (Applause)

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:15.498
(Applause)
