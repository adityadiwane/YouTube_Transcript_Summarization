00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So, if you're in the audience today,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Whether you're an artist, a technologist,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
a lawyer or a fan,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
the handling of copyright directly impacts your life.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Rights management is no longer

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
simply a question of ownership,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
it's a complex web of relationships

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
and a critical part of our cultural landscape.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
but in order to give them choices about what they can do

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
with copies, mashups and more,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
we need to first identify

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Two years ago, recording artist Chris Brown

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
released the official video of his single "Forever."

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
A fan saw it on TV,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
recorded it with her camera phone,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
and uploaded it to YouTube.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
in our Content ID system,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
within seconds of attempting to upload the video,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
the copy was detected,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
giving Sony the choice of what to do next.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
But how do we know that the user's video was a copy?

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
Well, it starts with content owners

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
delivering assets into our database,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
along with a usage policy

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
that tells us what to do when we find a match.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
We compare each upload

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
against all of the reference files in our database.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
This heat map is going to show you

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
how the brain of the system works.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Here we can see the original reference file

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
being compared to the user generated content.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
The system compares every moment

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
of one to the other to see if there's a match.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
This means that we can identify a match

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
plays it in slow motion

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and has degraded audio and video quality.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
And we do this every time

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
that a video is uploaded to YouTube.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And that's over 20 hours of video every minute.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
When we find a match,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And the scale and the speed of this system

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
is truly breathtaking.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
We're not just talking about a few videos,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
we're talking about over

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
100 years of video every day,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
between new uploads and the legacy scans

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
we regularly do across all of the content on the site.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
When we compare those hundred years of video,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
we're comparing it against millions

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
of reference files in our database.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
It would be like 36,000 people

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
staring at 36,000 monitors

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
each and every day, without so much as a coffee break.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Now, what do we do when we find a match?

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Well, most rights owners, instead of blocking,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
will allow the copy to be published.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
And then they benefit through the exposure,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
advertising and linked sales.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Remember Chris Brown's video "Forever"?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Well, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and that looked like the end of the story,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
but sometime last year, a young couple got married.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
This is their wedding video.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
You may have seen it.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
(Music)

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
What's amazing about this is,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
if the processional of the wedding was this much fun,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been?

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
I mean, who are these people?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
I totally want to go to that wedding.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
So their little wedding video went on

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
to get over 40 million views.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And instead of Sony blocking,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
they allowed the upload to occur.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
And they put advertising against it

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
and linked from it to iTunes.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And the song, 18 months old,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
went back to number four on the iTunes charts.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
So Sony is generating revenue from both of these.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And Jill and Kevin, the happy couple,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
they came back from their honeymoon

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and found that their video had gone crazy viral.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
to end domestic violence.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
The "JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance" became so popular

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
that NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office,"

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
which just goes to show,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
it's truly an ecosystem of culture.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
but sometimes big studios borrowing back.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
By empowering choice, we can create a culture of opportunity.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And all it took to change things around

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
was to allow for choice through rights identification.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
So why has no one ever solved this problem before?

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
It's because it's a big problem,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and it's complicated and messy.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
It's not uncommon for a single video

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
to have multiple rights owners.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
There's musical labels.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
There's multiple music publishers.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
And each of these can vary by country.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
There's lots of cases

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
where we have more than one work mashed together.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
So we have to manage many claims

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
to the same video.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
But the system only works through

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
the participation of rights owners.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
you should register in the Content ID system,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and then you'll have the choice

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
about how your content is used.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
By simply blocking all reuse,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
you'll miss out on new art forms,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
new audiences,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
new distribution channels

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and new revenue streams.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
But it's not just about dollars and impressions.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Just look at all the joy

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
that was spread through progressive rights management

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
and new technology.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
Thank you.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
(Applause)
