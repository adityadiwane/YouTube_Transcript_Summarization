00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.260
(Applause)

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.260
(Applause)

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
I am a papercutter.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
(Laughter)

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
I cut stories.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
So my process is very straightforward.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
I take a piece of paper,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
I visualize my story,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
sometimes I sketch, sometimes I don't.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And as my image

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
is already inside the paper,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
I just have to remove

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
what's not from that story.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
So I didn't come to papercutting

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
in a straight line.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
In fact,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
I see it more as a spiral.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I was not born

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
with a blade in my hand.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
And I don't remember papercutting as a child.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
As a teenager,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
I was sketching, drawing,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and I wanted to be an artist.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.260
But I was also a rebel.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And I left everything

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.260
and went for a long series of odd jobs.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So among them,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
I have been a shepherdess,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
a truck driver,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
a factory worker,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
a cleaning lady.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
I worked in tourism for one year

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
in Mexico,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
one year in Egypt.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
I moved for two years

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
in Taiwan.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And then I settled in New York

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
where I became a tour guide.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And I still worked as a tour leader,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
traveled back and forth

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
in China, Tibet and Central Asia.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
So of course, it took time, and I was nearly 40,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and I decided it's time

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
to start as an artist.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.260
(Applause)

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
I chose papercutting

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
because paper is cheap,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
it's light,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and you can use it

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
in a lot of different ways.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And I chose the language of silhouette

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
because graphically it's very efficient.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And it's also just getting to the essential of things.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
So the word "silhouette"

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
comes from a minister of finance,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Etienne de Silhouette.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And he slashed so many budgets

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
that people said they couldn't afford

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
paintings anymore,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and they needed to have their portrait

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
"a la silhouette."

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
(Laughter)

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So I made series of images, cuttings,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and I assembled them in portfolios.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
And people told me --

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
like these 36 views of the Empire State building --

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.260
they told me, "You're making artist books."

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
So artist books have a lot of definitions.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
They come in a lot of different shapes.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
But to me,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
they are fascinating objects

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
to visually narrate a story.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
They can be with words

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
or without words.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And I have a passion

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
for images and for words.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
I love pun

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
and the relation to the unconscious.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
I love oddities of languages.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
And everywhere I lived, I learned the languages,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
but never mastered them.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
So I'm always looking

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
for the false cognates

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
or identical words in different languages.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
So as you can guess, my mother tongue is French.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.260
And my daily language is English.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
So I did a series of work

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
where it was identical words

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
in French and in English.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
So one of these works

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
is the "Spelling Spider."

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
So the Spelling Spider

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
is a cousin of the spelling bee.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
(Laughter)

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
But it's much more connected to the Web.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
(Laughter)

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
And this spider

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
spins a bilingual alphabet.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.260
So you can read "architecture active"

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
or "active architecture."

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
So this spider goes through the whole alphabet

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.260
with identical adjectives and substantives.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
So if you don't know one of these languages,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
it's instant learning.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
And one ancient form of the book

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
is scrolls.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
So scrolls are very convenient,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
because you can create a large image

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
on a very small table.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.260
So the unexpected consequences of that

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.260
is that you only see one part of your image,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.260
so it makes a very freestyle architecture.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And I'm making all those kinds of windows.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
So it's to look beyond the surface.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
It's to have a look

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
at different worlds.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
And very often I've been an outsider.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
So I want to see how things work

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and what's happening.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
So each window

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
is an image

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
and is a world

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
that I often revisit.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
And I revisit this world

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
thinking about the image

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
or clichÃ© about what we want to do,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
and what are the words, colloquialisms,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
that we have with the expressions.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
It's all if.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.260
So what if we were living in balloon houses?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.260
It would make a very uplifting world.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
It would be so light.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.260
So sometimes I view from the inside,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
like EgoCentriCity

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
and the inner circles.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Sometimes it's a global view,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
to see our common roots

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.260
and how we can use them to catch dreams.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And we can use them also

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
as a safety net.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
And my inspirations

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
are very eclectic.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
I'm influenced by everything I read,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
everything I see.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
I have some stories that are humorous,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
like "Dead Beats."

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
(Laughter)

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Other ones are historical.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Here it's "CandyCity."

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
It's a non-sugar-coated

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
history of sugar.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
It goes from slave trade

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
to over-consumption of sugar

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.260
with some sweet moments in between.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And sometimes I have an emotional response to news,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.260
such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
Other times, it's not even my stories.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
People tell me their lives,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
their memories, their aspirations,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
and I create a mindscape.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
I channel their history

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
[so that] they have a place to go back

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.260
to look at their life and its possibilities.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.260
I call them Freudian cities.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
I cannot speak for all my images,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.260
so I'll just go through a few of my worlds

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
just with the title.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
"ModiCity."

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
"ElectriCity."

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.260
"MAD Growth on Columbus Circle."

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
"ReefCity."

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.260
"A Web of Time."

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
"Chaos City."

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
"Daily Battles."

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
"FeliCity."

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
"Floating Islands."

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
And at one point,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
I had to do "The Whole Nine Yards."

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
So it's actually a papercut that's nine yards long.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
(Laughter)

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
So in life and in papercutting,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
everything is connected.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
One story leads to another.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
I was also interested

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
in the physicality of this format,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
because you have to walk to see it.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
And parallel to my cutting

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
is my running.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
I started with small images,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
I started with a few miles.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
Larger images, I started to run marathons.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
Then I went to run 50K, then 60K.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Then I ran 50 miles -- ultramarathons.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
And I still feel I'm running,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
it's just the training

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
to become a long-distance papercutter.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
(Laughter)

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.260
And running gives me a lot of energy.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
Here is a three-week papercutting marathon

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
at the Museum of Arts and Design

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
in New York City.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.260
The result is "Hells and Heavens."

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
It's two panels 13 ft. high.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
They were installed in the museum on two floors,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
but in fact, it's a continuous image.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
And I call it "Hells and Heavens"

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.260
because it's daily hells and daily heavens.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
There is no border in between.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Some people are born in hells,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
and against all odds, they make it to heavens.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Other people make the opposite trip.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
That's the border.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
You have sweatshops in hells.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
You have people renting their wings in the heavens.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
And then you have all those individual stories

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.260
where sometimes we even have the same action,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:05.260
and the result puts you in hells or in heavens.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
So the whole "Hells and Heavens"

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
is about free will

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and determinism.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
And in papercutting,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.260
you have the drawing as the structure itself.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
So you can take it off the wall.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Here it's an artist book installation

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
called "Identity Project."

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.260
It's not autobiographical identities.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.260
They are more our social identities.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
And then you can just walk behind them

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
and try them on.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
So it's like the different layers

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
of what we are made of

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
and what we present to the world

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
as an identity.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
That's another artist book project.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.260
In fact, in the picture, you have two of them.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
It's one I'm wearing

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
and one that's on exhibition

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
at the Center for Books Arts in New York City.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
Why do I call it a book?

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
It's called "Fashion Statement,"

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
and there are quotes about fashion,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
so you can read it,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
and also,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
because the definition of artist book

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
is very generous.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
So artist books, you take them off the wall.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
You take them for a walk.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
You can also install them as public art.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Here it's in Scottsdale, Arizona,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
and it's called "Floating Memories."

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
So it's regional memories,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
and they are just randomly moved by the wind.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
I love public art.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
And I entered competitions

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
for a long time.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
After eight years of rejection,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
I was thrilled to get my first commission

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
with the Percent for Art in New York City.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
It was for a merger station

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
for emergency workers and firemen.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
I made an artist book

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
that's in stainless steel

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
instead of paper.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.260
I called it "Working in the Same Direction."

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
But I added weathervanes on both sides

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.260
to show that they cover all directions.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
With public art,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
I could also make cut glass.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
And each time I make public art,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
I want something that's really relevant

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
to the place it's installed.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
So for the subway in New York,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
I saw a correspondence

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
between riding the subway

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
and reading.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
It is travel in time, travel on time.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
And Bronx literature,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
it's all about Bronx writers

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
and their stories.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
Another glass project

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
is in a public library

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
in San Jose, California.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
So I made a vegetable point of view

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
of the growth of San Jose.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
So I started in the center

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
with the acorn

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.260
for the Ohlone Indian civilization.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Then I have the fruit from Europe

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
for the ranchers.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
And then the fruit of the world for Silicon Valley today.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
And it's still growing.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
So the technique, it's cut,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
sandblasted, etched

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.260
and printed glass into architectural glass.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
And outside the library,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.260
I wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
I took library material

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
that had fruit in their title

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
and I used them to make an orchard walk

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
with these fruits of knowledge.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
I also planted the bibliotree.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
So it's a tree,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
and in its trunk you have the roots of languages.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.260
And it's all about international writing systems.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
And on the branches

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
you have library material growing.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
You can also have function and form

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
with public art.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
So in Aurora, Colorado it's a bench.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
But you have a bonus with this bench.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
you will walk away

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
with temporary branding of

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
the story element on your thighs.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
(Laughter)

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
Another functional work,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
it's in the south side of Chicago

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
for a subway station.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.260
And it's called "Seeds of the Future are Planted Today."

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
It's a story about transformation

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
and connections.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
So it acts as a screen

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
to protect the rail and the commuter,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
and not to have objects falling on the rails.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
To be able to change fences

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
and window guards into flowers,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
it's fantastic.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
And here I've been working for the last three years

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
with a South Bronx developer

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
to bring art to life

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
to low-income buildings

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
and affordable housing.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
So each building has its own personality.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.260
And sometimes it's about a legacy of the neighborhood,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.260
like in Morrisania, about the jazz history.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
And for other projects, like in Paris,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
it's about the name of the street.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
It's called Rue des Prairies -- Prairie Street.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
So I brought back the rabbit,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
the dragonfly,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
to stay in that street.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
And in 2009,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
I was asked to make a poster

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
to be placed in the subway cars in New York City

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
for a year.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.260
So that was a very captive audience.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.260
And I wanted to give them an escape.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
I created "All Around Town."

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
It is a papercutting,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
and then after, I added color on the computer.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
So I can call it techno-crafted.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
And along the way,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
I'm kind of making papercuttings

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
and adding other techniques.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
But the result is always to have stories.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
So the stories, they have a lot of possibilities.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
They have a lot of scenarios.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
I don't know the stories.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.260
I take images from our global imagination,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
from clichÃ©, from things we are thinking about,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
from history.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
And everybody's a narrator,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
because everybody has a story to tell.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
But more important

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
is everybody has to make a story

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
to make sense of the world.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
And in all these universes,

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.260
it's like imagination is the vehicle

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
to be transported with,

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
but the destination is our minds

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
and how we can reconnect

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
with the essential and with the magic.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.260
And it's what story cutting is all about.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:09.260
(Applause)
