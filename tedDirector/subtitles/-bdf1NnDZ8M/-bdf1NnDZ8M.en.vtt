00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
And in my idea, heaven is satisfied curiosity.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
where I can just lie down with my belly down,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.160
like I was watching TV when I was a child, and my elbows up.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
And I can basically look everywhere I want,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
see every movie I've always wanted to see.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.160
And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.160
in the subway in New York when you're reading,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
there's something really soothing and easy.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.160
Well, the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life, in a way,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
because I discovered ...

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.160
it took me a while to understand it,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.160
but when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.160
with objects than with people, I finally decided to really embrace this passion.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
And I basically live my life in sort of a trance,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.160
and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
Just to give you an example:

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.160
this is the exhibition, Humble Masterpieces, as it was at MoMA in 2004.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.160
We were in Queens,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
we were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
so we were in the small, small, small boondocks.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
That was one of the funnest moments of my career.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.160
But it's not only that.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
The typeface -- the typeface is Helvetica;

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
it's its 50th anniversary this year.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.160
And so I start thinking -- Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.160
trying to outdo Akzidenz-Grotesk, and come up with a new sans-serif typeface --

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
and the movie starts playing in my head already.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
And of course, you can imagine, with Humble Masterpieces

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
And I do hope, by the way, that the real goal of the exhibition

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
is going to have the same effect on you.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.160
The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
you know when they do homeworks at home?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
Instead of having a tray with two peas, I was hoping that they would go

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
into the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.160
and do their museum-quality design collection on a tray.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.160
So, everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.160
and at MoMA we put out some books

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160
just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.160
And when you do that, usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.160
and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
And a lot of nationalism came in.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.160
For instance, I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.160
but they were very proud

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
so every Spaniard said "la frego." And Italians did the pizza.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.160
And I wanted to show you, also, the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good --

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
they had moonshine, laundry detergents and liquid nails.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160
And I keep it going, and I just got,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.160
(Laughter)

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
also, this suggestion from Milan:

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.160
it's our traffic divider, which we call "panettone," and it's painted;

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.160
it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
to define all the lanes of traffic.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160
So, think of your own,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
send them on if you want to -- they're always welcome.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.160
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.160
what I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
I'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.160
Different parts of the world have a knack for different things.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.160
I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.160
and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.160
that you don't see elsewhere, but the contemporary art was terrible.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
In Italy, in Milan especially,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.160
contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160
But design -- oh, my God.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.160
What you find at the store at the corner, without going to any kind of fancy store,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
we are all so sophisticated.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
It's just what you find at the store.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.160
I'm always amazed -- three-year-olds know who Richard Serra is

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
and take you to the galleries.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.160
But design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
It's really interesting:

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
what many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.160
this kind of overdesigned -- in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but --

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
decoration, interior decoration.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
They think of somebody choosing fabrics.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.160
Design can be that, of course, but it can also be this.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.160
It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.160
to design gas masks for people,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.160
because, as you know, Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.160
So, what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.160
so that instead of being completely strangled, a teenager can also sip a Coke.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.160
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.160
can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.160
And then they make a little tent for the baby.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.160
However cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.160
and it is miles away from the fancy furniture,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
but still, it's part of my same field of passion.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.160
What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
harness the power of MoMA

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
because it's great to work there. You really have power

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.160
in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.160
and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.160
I'm very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.160
in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
which is to try and see what's going on in the world

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.160
and try to use that authority in order to make things better.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
There have been many episodes,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.160
but in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather --

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.160
I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly --

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.160
Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
were involved in two competitions:

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.160
one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.160
was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
that then sparked a whole line of furniture.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.160
And then there was good design for very low price.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.160
pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
So, I started out in '95 with this exhibition that was called

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.160
Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.160
It was about a new phase, in my opinion, in the world of design

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.160
in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:08.160
And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California;

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.160
at that time, they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
And at the same time, the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro, who did these

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.160
beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.160
So you see, the range is really quite diverse.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
And then, for instance, this other exhibition

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
that was entitled Workspheres in 2001,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.160
where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.160
the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
And you see IDEO there.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
It was beautiful -- it was called Personal Skies.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.160
The idea was that if you had a cubicle, you could project a sky on top

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
of your head and have your own "Cielo in Una Stanza" -- a sky in a room --

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
it's a very famous Italian song.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
And other examples: this was Marti Guixe about working on the go,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
and Hella Jongerius, my favorite, about how to work at home.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.160
And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design:

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.160
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.160
current conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.160
and then what they do at the end -- if they are good --

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
is much more than the sum of its parts.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
Hella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
that is really quite amazing

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.160
and also quite hilarious.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
The idea behind her work was that

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.160
at that time, everybody was saying you have to really divide your life.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
Instead, she said, "No, no. Work and leisure can be together."

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.160
Yeah, that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the TV dinner of 2001.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.160
There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.160
but I don't want to focus on my shows.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.160
I would like, instead, to talk about how great some designers are.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
I've always had a hard time with the word "maverick."

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
I came to the United States 13 years ago, and to this day

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
I have to ask, "What does that mean?"

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
So, this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.160
there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
Therefore, he was not following everybody's lead,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160
and therefore, he was a maverick.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.160
So, designers do need to be mavericks,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.160
because the best way to design a successful object --

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.160
and also an object that we were missing before --

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
is to pretend that either it never existed

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.160
or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.160
So, Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
and it ended at the beginning of last year.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160
It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.160
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:54.160
And then when 9/11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.160
until, slowly but surely, it came back --

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
as a half-full glass instead of half-empty --

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.160
and it was about protection and safety.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:09.160
But it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
these kind of water-sterilizing straws,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.160
so it was really wide-ranging.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.160
It also had ... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.160
and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:28.160
But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore;

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.160
design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
It's a sense of economy and a sense, also, of humor.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.160
This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland, who's South African.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
It's a suit for civil disobedience.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.160
The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.160
and the police comes towards you, you're wearing this thing --

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160
so your heartbeat is amplified --

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.160
and the police is reminded;

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.160
it's like having a flower in front of the rifle.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.160
And also, you can imagine, a whole group of people with the same suit

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.160
will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
So, designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.160
functional, but they're functional to our understanding of issues.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.160
did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
so it disappears completely and you can hide away;

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.160
or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States --

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.160
I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA;

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.160
But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
the ultimate shelter is your sense of self,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.160
and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
This is Cindy van den Bremen, who is a Dutch designer

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
that's done this series of Capsters.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:05.160
They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski, play tennis,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.160
do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.160
And sometimes by doing this kind of research,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160
you encounter such beautiful ideas of design.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:21.160
Twan Verdonck is really young, I think he's 27, and working together with

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.160
stimulation for children that have psychological impairments.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160
They're quite beautiful.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you --

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.160
because autistic children like to be hugged tight, so it has a spring inside --

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.160
all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.160
in the mirror and regain a sense of self.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
Design really looks upon the whole world

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160
and it considers the world in all of its different ranges.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.160
I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.160
and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.160
And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.160
and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.160
I want to make this point by showing you two examples of

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.160
design coming from a sense of economy -- very, very clear limits.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:34.160
This is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.160
and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
So they're quite beautiful, but they're beautiful because

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
they're so smart and economical.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160
And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:52.160
Fernando and Humberto Campana, who got inspired by the poverty and

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.160
smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
selling for an enormous amount of money.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.160
But that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.160
So really, design takes everything into account,

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.160
as we become more and more wireless and impalpable,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
designers, instead, want us to be hands-on.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.160
Sometimes hammer-on.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.160
This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.160
Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160
your imprint, all the way to this beautiful series of objects

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.160
From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.160
to these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.160
(Laughter)

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.160
It's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:56.160
Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna, whose name was Marchetti,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.160
explain how the innovation in the military industry --

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
therefore, secret innovation -- and the innovation in the

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.160
civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.160
And that makes sense.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
In moments of war there's great technological innovation,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
and in the world you have to do without --

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
well, during the Second World War, you had to do without steel,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160
you had to do without aluminum.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.160
And then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.160
available for the civilian market.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.160
Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.160
by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance:

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
I think that this is a strange moment.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.160
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.160
so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
But it surely is a very important moment for design,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.160
because not only is the technology proceeding, not only is computing

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.160
technology making open-source possible also in the world of design,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
but also the idea of sustainability --

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.160
which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint,

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.160
but also sustainability of human interrelationships --

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.160
is very much part of the work of so many designers.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160
And that's why designers, more and more, are working on behaviors

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.160
rather than on objects.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.160
Especially the good ones, not all of them.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.160
I wanted to show you, for instance, the work of Mathieu Lehanneur,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.160
which is quite fantastic.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.160
He's another young designer from France who's working --

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.160
and at this point he's working, also, with pharmaceutical companies --

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.160
on new ways to engage patients, especially children,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.160
in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.160
For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.160
that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.160
so the child has to go -- pffff! -- to release and relieve the container itself.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.160
And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.160
so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.160
in this particular kind of delivery.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:06.160
Similarly, there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.160
you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.160
so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste, orally.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.160
The next show that I'm going to work on --

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.160
and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here --

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
is about the relationship between design and science.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.160
I'm trying to find not the metaphors, but, rather, the points in common --

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.160
the common gripes, the common issues, the common preoccupations --

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.160
and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.160
as an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.160
And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.160
I've sent an email already to quite a few of you.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.160
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales,

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.160
and therefore, really work at the scale of the very small

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.160
to make it very big and very meaningful.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.160
Thank you. (Applause)
