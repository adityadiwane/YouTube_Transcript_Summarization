00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm supposed to scare you, because it's about fear, right?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And you should be really afraid,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but not for the reasons why you think you should be.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You should be really afraid that --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
if we stick up the first slide on this thing -- there we go -- that you're missing out.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
you're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And this is what this adventure's really about.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is crystallized DNA.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Every life form on this planet -- every insect, every bacteria, every plant,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
every animal, every human, every politician -- (Laughter)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
is coded in that stuff.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA, it looks like that.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And we're just beginning to understand this stuff.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If you think that the mapping of America's made a difference,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
or landing on the moon, or this other stuff,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
(Laughter)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It turns out that what this stuff is --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and Richard Dawkins has written about this --

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
is, this is really a river out of Eden.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cells

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
is really a history of where you've been for the past billion years.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And we could start dating things,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and we could start changing medicine and archeology.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
White Europeans were subject to the plague.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And when they were subject to the plague, most people didn't survive,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR5 receptor.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And that mutation was passed on to their kids

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
because they're the ones that survived,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
so there was a great deal of population pressure.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
In Africa, because you didn't have these cities,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
you didn't have that CCR5 population pressure mutation.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We can date it to 700 years ago.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and not as fast across Europe.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And we're beginning to find these little things for malaria,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
for sickle cell, for cancers.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And in the measure that we map ourselves,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And this Friday, I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and I want you to toast these two people.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Because this Friday, 50 years ago, Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and that is almost as important a date

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
as the 12th of February when we first mapped ourselves,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
but anyway, we'll get to that.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I thought we'd talk about the new zoo.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So, all you guys have heard about DNA, all the stuff that DNA does,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
it turns out that there's ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
which is part of the reason

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
why this whole species-mapping project is so important.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Because we're just beginning to learn

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
where we came from and what we are.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
which is what makes you you,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
as far as gene code inside each of your cells,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and this little amoeba which, you know,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So, this little thingamajig has a genome

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
that's 200 times the size of yours.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
it may not turn out to be chips.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And, again, we're learning from life and how life works.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
This funky little thing: people didn't used to think

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
because it was dangerous and, of course, nothing lived there.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And then finally somebody picked up a microscope

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And sitting next to that water in the cores

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
was this little Deinococcus radiodurans, doing a backstroke,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
having its chromosomes blown apart every day,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
six, seven times, restitching them,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
living in about 200 times the radiation that would kill you.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and how important and how interesting this journey into life is,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and how many different life forms there are,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and how there can be different life forms living in

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
very different places, maybe even outside of this planet.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Because if you can live in radiation that looks like this,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that brings up a whole series of interesting questions.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
This little thingamajig: we didn't know this thingamajig existed.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
We should have known that this existed

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So, this thing is 0.75 millimeters.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And what you're looking at with this namibiensis

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
is the biggest bacteria we've ever seen.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Again, we didn't know this thing was there three years ago.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
We're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
This is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
lives inside the equivalent of battery acid,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and excretes sulfuric acid.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So, when you think of odd life forms,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
when you think of what it takes to live,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
it turns out this is a very efficient life form,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and they call it an archaea. Archaea means "the ancient ones."

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
when this planet was covered

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
by things like sulfuric acid in batteries,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So, it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Your fear should be that you are not,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
that you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I mean, George Bush -- he's going to be gone, alright? Life isn't.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Whether the humans survive or don't survive,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
these things are going to be living on this planet or other planets.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that's really the most exciting intellectual adventure

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
that we've ever been on.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gaur.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Conservation group gets together,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
tries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
They can't do it naturally, so what they do with this thing is

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
they take a spoon, take some cells out of an adult gaur's mouth, code,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
reprogram cow's egg -- different gene code.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
When you do that, the cow gives birth to a gaur.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We are now experimenting with bongos, pandas, elands, Sumatran tigers,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and the Australians -- bless their hearts --

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
are playing with these things.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Now, the last of these things died in September 1936.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
These are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But it turns out that as we learn more about gene code

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and how to reprogram species,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And when we learn how to close the gene gaps,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
then we can put a full string of DNA together.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
we may give birth to an animal

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
that hasn't walked the earth since 1936.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And then you can start going back further,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and you can start thinking about dodos,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and you can think about other species.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And in other places, like Maryland, they're trying to figure out

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
what the primordial ancestor is.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Because each of us contains our entire gene code

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
of where we've been for the past billion years,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
because we've evolved from that stuff,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
you can take that tree of life and collapse it back,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and in the measure that you learn to reprogram,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
maybe we'll give birth to something

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
that is very close to the first primordial ooze.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And it's all coming out of things that look like this.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
These are companies that didn't exist five years ago.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Some are public. Some are private.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
It takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Takes about 3 million dollars the second time.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
We will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
That means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And it will be really boring. It will read like this.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
(Laughter)

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Because if you happen to find this one inside your body,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
you're in big trouble, because that's the source code for Ebola.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
That's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
But plants work the same way and insects work the same way,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and this apple works the same way.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Because this thing codes ones and zeros,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and this thing codes A, T, C, Gs, and it sits up there,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
absorbing energy on a tree, and one fine day

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
it has enough energy to say, execute, and it goes [thump]. Right?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
(Laughter)

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
it executes the first line of code, which reads just like that,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
AATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Next line of code: make a stem.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Next line of code, TACGGGG: make a flower that's white,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
that blooms in the spring, that smells like this.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
In the measure that you have the code

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and the measure that you read it --

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and, by the way, the first plant was read two years ago;

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
the first human was read two years ago;

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the first insect was read two years ago.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
The first thing that we ever read was in 1995:

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
a little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
In the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
you can change the source code, and you can reprogram life forms

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
that feels like silk in corn.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
This changes all rules. This is life, but we're reprogramming it.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And what you can do now is,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and what those genes code for, and what animals they code against,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and then you can tie it to the literature.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And in the measure that you can do that, you can go home today,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and get on the Internet, and access

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
the world's biggest public library, which is a library of life.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And you can do some pretty strange things

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
if you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
he's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Why would Cliff be doing that? He doesn't have a restaurant.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
(Laughter)

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
The reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wings

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and you picked up the lizard, sometimes the tail fell off, but it regrew.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Not so in human beings:

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
you cut off an arm, you cut off a leg -- it doesn't regrow.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
But because each of your cells contains your entire gene code,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
each cell can be reprogrammed, if we don't stop stem cell research

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and if we don't stop genomic research,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
to express different body functions.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and what the program is for those cells to differentiate,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
one of the things we're going to be able to do

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
is to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and one of the things we're going to learn how to do

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
is how to reprogram cells like stem cells

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
in such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And you are likely to be wandering around -- and your children --

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
in some places in the world where they don't stop the research.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
How's this stuff work? If each of you differs

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
from the person next to you by one in a thousand, but only three percent codes,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
which means it's only one in a thousand times three percent,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
very small differences in expression and punctuation

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
can make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
(Laughter)

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Right?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
That's perfectly clear. So, men read that sentence,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and they look at that sentence, and they read this.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Okay?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Now, women look at that sentence and they say, uh-uh, wrong.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
This is the way it should be seen.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:40.000
(Laughter)

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
That's what your genes are doing.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
That's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Right? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but...

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I won't go there.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
You can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
You can look at this, right?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And they look at the world a little differently.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
They look at the same world and they say...

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
(Laughter)

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
That's how the same gene code -- that's why you have 30,000 genes,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
mice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Mice and men are the same. Wives know that, but anyway.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
You can make very small changes in gene code

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
and get really different outcomes,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
even with the same string of letters.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
That's what your genes are doing every day.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
That's why sometimes a person's genes

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
don't have to change a lot to get cancer.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
These little chippies, these things are the size of a credit card.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
They will test any one of you for 60,000 genetic conditions.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
That brings up questions of privacy and insurability

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and all kinds of stuff, but it also allows us to start going after diseases,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
it turns out that three diseases with

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
completely similar clinical syndromes

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
are completely different diseases.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Because in ALL leukemia, that set of genes over there over-expresses.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
In MLL, it's the middle set of genes,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and in AML, it's the bottom set of genes.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And if one of those particular things is expressing in your body,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
then you take Gleevec and you're cured.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
If it is not expressing in your body,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
if you don't have one of those types --

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
a particular one of those types -- don't take Gleevec.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
It won't do anything for you.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Same thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Don't have an HER-2 receptor? Don't take Receptin.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Changes the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Changes the way medicine works.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
The greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
was this thing, and it turns out that

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
this is not so important any more.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
The U.S. Library of Congress, in terms of its printed volume of data,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
every month on a compound basis.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Let me say that again: A single genomics company

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
generates more data in a month, on a compound basis,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
than is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
This is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
So, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and the power doubles, right?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Except that when you lay that side by side with the speed

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
with which gene data's being deposited in GenBank,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Moore's Law is right here: it's the blue line.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
This is on a log scale, and that's what superexponential growth means.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
This is going to push computers to have to grow faster

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
than they've been growing, because so far,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
there haven't been applications that have been required

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
that need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And here's an interesting map.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
This is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
One of the really interesting questions is, if all this data's free,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
who's using it? This is the greatest public library in the world.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Well, it turns out that there's about 27 trillion bits

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
moving inside from the United States to the United States;

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
about 4.6 trillion is going over to those European countries;

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
about 5.5's going to Japan; there's almost no communication

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
between Japan, and nobody else is literate in this stuff.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
It's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war;

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
they're focusing on Bush; they're not interested in life.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
So, this is what a new map of the world looks like.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
That is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
In fact, it's not a genomically literate world.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
You can break this out by states.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And you can watch states rise and fall depending on

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
their ability to speak a language of life,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
and you can watch New York fall off a cliff,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And you can break it out by counties, because it's specific counties.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And if you want to get more specific,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
it's actually specific zip codes.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
(Laughter)

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
So, you want to know where life is happening?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Well, in Southern California it's happening in 92121. And that's it.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And that's the triangle between Salk, Scripps, UCSD,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
and it's called Torrey Pines Road.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
That means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful;

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
it means you don't need a lot of people to be successful;

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
in about three or four carefully picked 747s.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Same thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but --

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
oh, by the way, the ones that are the same color are contiguous.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
What's the net effect of this?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
In an agricultural society, the difference between

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
the richest and the poorest,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
the most productive and the least productive, was five to one. Why?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Because in agriculture, if you had 10 kids

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
you could produce about five times more wealth, on average,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
than your neighbor.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
In a knowledge society, that number is now 427 to 1.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
It really matters if you're literate, not just in reading and writing

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
in English and French and German,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
So, if there is something you should fear,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
it's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Because it really matters who speaks life.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
That's why nations rise and fall.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
And it turns out that if you went back to the 1870s,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
the most productive nation on earth was Australia, per person.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about 1950,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
and then Switzerland about 1973, and then the U.S. got back on top --

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
And today, of course, you all know that the most productive nation

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
on earth is Luxembourg, producing about one third more wealth

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
per person per year than America.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Tiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Just smart people moving bits. Different rules.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Here's differential productivity rates.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Here's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
So, about 3,000 Americans, 6,000 Koreans, 14,000 Brits,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
790,000 Argentines. You want to know why Argentina's crashing?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
It's got nothing to do with inflation.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
It's got nothing to do with privatization.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
You can take a Harvard-educated Ivy League economist,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
stick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the country

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
because he doesn't understand how the rules have changed.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Oh, yeah, and it takes about 5.6 million Indians.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Well, watch what happens to India.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
India and China used to be 40 percent of the global economy

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
just at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Two billion people. One third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealth

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
because they didn't get this change,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
because they kept treating their people like serfs

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
instead of like shareholders of a common project.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
They didn't keep the people who were educated.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
They didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Silicon Valley did. And that's why they say

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
that Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Not integrated circuits: Indians and Chinese.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
(Laughter)

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Here's what's happening in the world.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
It turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in 1950,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
when it was founded, there were 50 countries in this world.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
It turns out there's now about 192.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Country after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing --

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
and it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
In the 1990s, these are sovereign states

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
that did not exist before 1990.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
And this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
We're generating about 3.12 states per year.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
People are taking control of their own states,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And the really interesting thing is,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
you and your kids are empowered to build great empires,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
and you don't need a lot to do it.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
(Music)

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
And, given that the music is over, I was going to talk

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
and how code works.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Moderator: Two minutes.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
(Laughter)

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Juan Enriquez: No, I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next year

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
because I don't want to take any of Laurie's time.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
But thank you very much.
