00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I have had the distinct pleasure

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
of living inside two biospheres.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.160
Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
I've also lived in Biosphere 2.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.160
And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
And hopefully from that I get to learn something.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
So what did I learn? Well,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
here I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
So I am harvesting the wheat, in order to make the dough.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
And then of course I have to milk the goats

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
and feed the goats in order to make the cheese.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
It took me four months in Biosphere 2 to make a pizza.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
Here in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
because I pick up the phone and I call and say,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
"Hey, can you deliver the pizza?"

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
So Biosphere 2

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
was essentially a three-acre,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
entirely sealed, miniature world

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
(Laughter)

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel --

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
essentially entirely sealed.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
So we had our own miniature rainforest,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
a private beach with a coral reef.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
We had a savanna, a marsh, a desert.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
We had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
And of course we had our human habitat, where we lived.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
Back in the mid-'80s when we were designing Biosphere 2,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
I mean, what is a biosphere?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
Back then, yes, I guess we all know now

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right?

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
And so we decided that what it really is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
is that it is entirely materially closed --

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
that is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material --

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
and energetically open,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
which is essentially what planet Earth is.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
This is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
that we called our Test Module.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
And the very first day that this fellow, John Allen,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
walked in, to spend a couple of days in there

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
to hopefully keep him alive,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
the doctors were incredibly concerned

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160
or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something, fungus.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
But of course none of that happened.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
And over the ensuing few years,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
there were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
But by 1991

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
we finally had this thing built.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
And it was time for us to go in

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
and give it a go.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
We needed to know,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
is life this malleable?

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
Can you take this biosphere,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
that has evolved on a planetary scale,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
and jam it into a little bottle,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
and will it survive?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
Big questions.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
in the universe -- if we were going to go to Mars, for instance,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
would we take a biosphere with us, to live in it?

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
We also wanted to know so we can understand more about

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
the Earth that we all live in.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
and try out this baby.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Let's take it on a maiden voyage.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
Will it work? Or will something happen

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.160
that we can't understand and we can't fix,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.160
thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres?

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
So eight of us went in: four men and four women.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
More on that later.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
(Laughter)

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
And this is the world that we lived in.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
So, on the top, we had

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
these beautiful rainforests and an ocean,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.160
and underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
which is where all the pumps and the valves

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
and the water tanks and the air handlers, and all of that.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
One of the Biospherians called it "garden of Eden

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
on top of an aircraft carrier."

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
And then also we had the human habitat of course,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
with the laboratories, and all of that.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
This is the agriculture.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
It was essentially an organic farm.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
The day I walked into Biosphere 2,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
I was, for the first time,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
breathing a completely different atmosphere

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
than everybody else in the world,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
except seven other people.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
At that moment I became part of that biosphere.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
And I don't mean that in an abstract sense;

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
I mean it rather literally.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
When I breathed out, my CO2

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.160
fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
(Laughter)

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
And those sweet potatoes

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
became part of me.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
In fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
I became orange with sweet potato.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.160
I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.160
I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
When it came to our atmosphere, however,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.160
it wasn't that much of a joke over the long term,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.160
because it turned out that we were losing oxygen, quite a lot of oxygen.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
And we knew that we were losing CO2.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.160
And so we were working to sequester carbon.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Good lord -- we know that term now.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
We were growing plants like crazy.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
We were taking their biomass, storing them in the basement,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
growing plants, going around, around, around,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
We stopped irrigating our soil, as much as we could.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.160
We stopped tilling, so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
But our oxygen was going down faster

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
than our CO2 was going up, which was quite unexpected,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
And it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
We had lost seven tons of oxygen.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
And we had no clue where it was.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
And I tell you, when you lose a lot of oxygen --

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
and our oxygen went down quite far;

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent --

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
my goodness, do you feel dreadful.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
And we had sleep apnea at night.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
So you'd wake up gasping with breath,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
because your blood chemistry has changed.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
And that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you -- (Gasps) --

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
take a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
And everybody outside thought we were dying.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
I mean, the media was making it sound like were were dying.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
And I had to call up my mother every other day saying, "No, Mum, it's fine, fine.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine."

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
And the doctor was, in fact, checking us

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
to make sure we were, in fact, fine.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.160
But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.160
And it was time for us to put oxygen in.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
And you might think, well,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
"Boy, your life support system

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?"

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
Yes. In a sense it was terrifying.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160
Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
at any time, if it really got bad,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
though who was going to say, "I can't take it anymore!"?

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
Not me, that was for sure.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
But on the other hand, it was the scientific gold of the project,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
because we could really crank this baby up,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
as a scientific tool,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
and see if we could, in fact, find

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
where those seven tons of oxygen had gone.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.160
And we did indeed find it.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
And we found it in the concrete.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
Essentially it had done something very simple.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
It broke down; it took oxygen out of the air;

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
it put CO2 into the air; and it went into the concrete.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
Pretty straightforward really.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
So at the end of the two years

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
when we came out, we were elated,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
because, in fact, although you might say

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
we had discovered something that was quite "uhh,"

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
when your oxygen is going down,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
stopped working, essentially, in your life support system,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
that's a very bad failure.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
Except that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
And nothing else emerged

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
that really was as serious as that.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
And we proved the concept, more or less.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
People, on the other hand, was a different subject.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.160
We were -- yeah I don't know that we were fixable.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
We all went quite nuts, I will say.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
And the day I came out of Biosphere 2,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.160
I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
For two years I'd been seeing people through the glass.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
And everybody ran up to me.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.160
And I recoiled. They stank!

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
People stink!

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
and all kinds of stuff.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
but nothing with perfume.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
And boy do we stink out here.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
Not only that,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.160
but I lost touch of where my food came from.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
I had been growing all my own food.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
I had no idea what was in my food, where it came from.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
I didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
In fact, I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
reading all the names on all of the things.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
People must have thought I was nuts.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.160
It was really quite astonishing.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
And I slowly lost track

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.160
of where I was in this big biosphere, in this big biosphere that we all live in.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160
In Biosphere 2 I totally understood

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.160
that I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
and it had an impact on me,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
very viscerally, very literally.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
So I went about my business:

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
Paragon Space Development Corporation,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
because I had nothing else to do.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
And one of the things we did was

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
and what can you do with them?

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
for 16 months, where we managed to produce

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
the first organisms to go through

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
complete multiple life cycles in space --

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.160
really pushing the envelope

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
of understanding how malleable

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
our life systems are.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
And I'm also proud to announce

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
that you're getting a sneak preview -- on Friday we're going to announce

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
that we're actually forming a team

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
which is going to be pretty fun.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing:

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.160
an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
And part of that is that we had to model

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.160
very rapid circulation of CO2

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.160
and oxygen and water through this plant system.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
As a result of that modeling

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
I ended up in all places,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.160
in Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.160
Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.160
is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.160
incredibly stark, and I have no understanding

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
of how people eke out a living there.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160
It is so dry.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160
This is what I saw.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
But this is also what I saw.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
I saw a company that had

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
taken seawater

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
and sand, and they were growing

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.160
a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
And it will produce a food crop.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
In this case it was oilseed.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
It was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
in a plantation.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
And the mangroves were providing wood

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
and honey and leaves for the animals,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160
so that they could produce milk and whatnot,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
like we had in the Biosphere.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.160
And all of it was coming from this: shrimp farms.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
frankly, from an environmental point of view.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.160
They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
They also pollute their next-door neighbors.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
So they're all shitting each other's ponds, quite literally.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
And what this project was doing

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
was taking the effluent of these,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.160
and turning them into all of this food.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.160
They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.160
They had created an industrial ecosystem, of a sense.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.160
I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
for a carbon credit program, under the U.N.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
Kyoto Protocol system.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
And as I was modeling this mangrove swamp,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
I was thinking to myself, "How do you put a box around this?"

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
When I'm modeling a plant in a box, literally,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160
I know where to draw the boundary.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
Well, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
And understand its interactions with the entire Earth.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.160
And put your project in that context.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.160
Around the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.160
from what I would call a biocidal species,

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.160
one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally --

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.160
have designed our systems to kill life, a lot of the time.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.160
This is in fact, this beautiful photograph,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
is in fact over the Amazon.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:26.160
And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
And those beautiful wispy clouds

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.160
are, in fact, fires, human-made fires.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.160
We're in the process of transforming from this,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.160
to what I would call a biophilic society,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
one where we learn to nurture society.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.160
Now it may not seem like it, but we are.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
It is happening all across the world,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
in every kind of walk of life,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
and every kind of career

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.160
and industry that you can think of.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.160
And I think often times people get lost in that.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.160
They go, "But how can I possibly find my way in that?

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.160
It's such a huge subject."

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.160
And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.160
This is the story of a rake in my backyard.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160
This was my backyard,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
very early on, when I bought my property.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.160
And in Arizona, of course, everybody puts gravel down.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.160
And they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.160
And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.160
and I want to throttle them.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
It's a certain type of aesthetic.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
We're very uncomfortable with untidiness.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.160
And I threw away my rake.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.160
And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
And over time, essentially what have I been doing?

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
I've been building topsoil.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.160
And so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.160
And I have an oasis.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.160
This is what happens every spring. For six weeks,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.160
six to eight weeks, I have this flush of green oasis.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
This is actually in a riparian area.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
And all of Tucson could be like this

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160
if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.160
The small stuff counts.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
The Industrial Revolution -- and Prometheus --

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.160
has given us this, the ability to light up the world.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160
It has also given us this,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.160
the ability to look at the world from the outside.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
Now we may not all have

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.160
another biosphere that we can run to,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
and compare it to this biosphere.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.160
But we can look at the world,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.160
and try to understand where we are in its context,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.160
and how we choose to interact with it.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.160
And if you lose where you are in your biosphere,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.160
or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.160
with where you are in the biosphere,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.160
I would say to you,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
take a deep breath.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
The yogis had it right.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.160
Breath does, in fact, connect us all

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
in a very literal way.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
Take a breath now.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.160
And as you breathe, think

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.160
about what is in your breath.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:16.160
There perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting next-door to you.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.160
from some algae on the beach not far from here.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.160
It also connects us in time.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.160
There may be some carbon in your breath

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.160
from the dinosaurs.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.160
There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.160
that will be in the breath

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
of your great-great-great-grandchildren.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160
Thank you. (Applause)
