00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.160
I began "The Vagina Monologues" because I was worried about vaginas.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.160
I'm very worried today about this notion, this world,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.160
this prevailing kind of force of security.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.160
I see this word, hear this word, feel this word everywhere.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
Real security, security checks, security watch, security clearance.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.160
Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.160
What does anyone mean when they talk about real security?

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
And why have we, as Americans particularly,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
become a nation that strives for security above all else?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
In fact, I think that security is elusive. It's impossible.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.160
We all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
People change us. Nothing is secure.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
And that's actually the good news.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
This is, of course, unless your whole life is about being secure.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
I think that when that is the focus of your life,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
these are the things that happen.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.160
You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.160
You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
as they might confuse you or challenge you.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
You can't open yourself to new experiences, new people,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
new ways of doing things -- they might take you off course.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.160
You can't not know who you are, so you cling to hard-matter identity.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
You become a Christian, Muslim, Jew.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
You're an Indian, Egyptian, Italian, American.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
You're a heterosexual or a homosexual, or you never have sex.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Or at least, that's what you say when you identify yourself.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
You become part of an "us."

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
In order to be secure, you defend against "them."

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
You cling to your land because it is your secure place.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
You become your nation. You become your religion.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
You become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
and protect you from doubt or change.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
But all this does, actually, is shut down your mind.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
In reality, it does not really make you safer.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160
I was in Sri Lanka, for example, three days after the tsunami,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
and I was standing on the beaches

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
and it was absolutely clear that, in a matter of five minutes,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
a 30-foot wave could rise up

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
and desecrate a people, a population and lives.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
All this striving for security, in fact,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
has made you much more insecure

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
because now you have to watch out all the time.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
There are people not like you -- people who you now call enemies.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
You have places you cannot go, thoughts you cannot think,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
worlds that you can no longer inhabit.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.160
And so you spend your days fighting things off, defending your territory

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
Your days become devoted to protecting yourself.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
This becomes your mission. That is all you do.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
Ideas get shorter. They become sound bytes.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
There are evildoers and saints, criminals and victims.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
There are those who, if they're not with us, are against us.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
It gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.160
It gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
occupy them, invade them and kill them,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
because they are only obstacles now to your security.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
In six years, I've had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.160
a global movement against [violence against] women,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
to travel probably to 60 countries,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.160
and spend a great deal of time in different portions.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
I've met women and men all over this planet,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
who through various circumstances --

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.160
war, poverty, racism, multiple forms of violence --

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
have never known security,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
or have had their illusion of security forever devastated.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
I've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
who were essentially brutalized and censored.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
I've been in Bosnian refugee camps.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
I was with women in Pakistan

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
who have had their faces melted off with acid.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160
I've been with girls all across America who were date-raped,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.160
One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
is that there is this emerging species.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
I loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
I've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
we call Vagina Warriors.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.160
These particular people, rather than getting AK-47s,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.160
or weapons of mass destruction, or machetes,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.160
in the spirit of the warrior, have gone into the center, the heart of pain, of loss.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
They have grieved it, they have died into it,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.160
and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160
They have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
towards another mission and another trajectory.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
These warriors now devote themselves and their lives

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.160
to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
There are thousands if not millions of them on the planet.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
I venture there are many in this room.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
They have a fierceness and a freedom

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
that I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.160
They have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
Their own personal security is not their end goal,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.160
and because of that, because, rather than worrying about security,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
because the transformation of suffering is their end goal,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
I actually believe they are creating real safety

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
and a whole new idea of security.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
I want to talk about a few of these people that I've met.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
Tomorrow, I am going to Cairo,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.160
and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
who are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
for battered women in the Middle East.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
and put themselves on the line,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.160
and were willing to be attacked and criticized.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
And through their work over the last years,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
this is not only happening that this house is opening,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
but it's being supported by many factions of the society

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
who never would have supported it.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
Women in Uganda this year,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
who put on "The Vagina Monologues" during V-Day,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
actually evoked the wrath of the government.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
And, I love this story so much.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
There was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
to talk about whether "Vaginas" could come to Uganda.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.160
And in this meeting -- it went on for weeks in the press,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
two weeks where there was huge discussion.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
The government finally made a decision

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
that "The Vagina Monologues" could not be performed in Uganda.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.160
But the amazing news was that because they had stood up, these women,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
and because they had been willing to risk their security,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
it began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
but all of Africa.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
As a result, this production, which had already sold out,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.160
every single person in that 800-seat audience, except for 10 people,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
made a decision to keep the money.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.160
They raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
There's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
She's a high school student.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.160
She had seen "The Vagina Monologues" and she was really moved. And as a result,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.160
she wore an "I heart my vagina" button to her high school in Minnesota.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160
(Laughter)

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.160
She was basically threatened to be expelled from school.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160
They told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.160
that it was not a legal thing, that it was not a moral thing,

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
that it was not a good thing.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
So she really struggled with this, what to do,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.160
and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together --

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
I believe it was 100, 150 students

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
all wore "I love my vagina" T-shirts,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
and the boys wore "I love her vagina" T-shirts to school.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
(Laughter)

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
Now this seems like a fairly, you know, frivolous,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.160
but what happened as a result of that, is that that school now

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.160
is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
or to say that she loved her vagina publicly.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
I know I've talked about Agnes here before,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
but I want to give you an update on Agnes.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
I met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:18.160
When she was a young girl, she had been mutilated against her will.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.160
That mutilation of her clitoris

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160
had actually obviously impacted her life

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
and changed it in a way that was devastating.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.160
She made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.160
but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
For eight years, she walked through the Rift Valley.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
She had this amazing box that she carried and it had a

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
torso of a woman's body in it, a half a torso,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
and she would teach people, everywhere she went,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.160
In the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
She saved 1,500 girls from being cut.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
When V-Day met her, we asked her how we could support her

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
I could get around a lot faster." So, we bought her a Jeep.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.160
In the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.160
So, we said, what else could we do?

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
She said, "If you help me get money, I could open a house."

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:16.160
Three years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.160
When she began her mission eight years ago, she was reviled,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.160
she was detested, she was completely slandered in her community.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
I am proud to tell you that six months ago,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
she was elected the deputy mayor of Narok.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:37.160
(Applause)

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
I think what I'm trying to say here

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.160
is that if your end goal is security,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.160
is that you create not only more insecurity in other people,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
but you make yourself far more insecure.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.160
Real security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.160
Not running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
Real security is not knowing something, when you don't know it.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.160
Real security is hungering for connection rather than power.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160
It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.160
It is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
that we are all utterly inter-bended,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
and one action by one being in one tiny town

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
has consequences everywhere.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
Real security is not only being able

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.160
to tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.160
and only trusting a situation when they are present.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.160
Something happened when I began traveling in V-Day, eight years ago. I got lost.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.160
I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.160
and I had no idea where I was.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
I didn't know where I was going, where I'd come from,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
and I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160
And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
where I was going, or where I had come from

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.160
because we are all essentially permanently displaced people.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
All of us are refugees.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.160
We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
moving towards a new place.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.160
Freedom means I may not be identified as any one group,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.160
but that I can visit and find myself in every group.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
It does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.160
but it does mean I am not hardened around them.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.160
I do not use them as weapons.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.160
In the shared future, it will be just that, shared.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
The end goal will [be] becoming vulnerable,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
realizing the place of our connection to one another,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:40.160
rather than becoming secure, in control and alone.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
Thank you very much.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
(Applause)

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.160
Chris Anderson: And how are you doing? Are you exhausted?

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.160
On a typical day, do you wake up with hope or gloom?

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
Eve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160
that in order to survive the twentieth century,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.160
we have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.160
And I think part of what I'm learning in this process

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.160
is that one must allow oneself to feel grief.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
And I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
and then moving on, I'm fine.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160
When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.160
and isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.160
Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
country to country, and city to city,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
the degree to which women, for example, are violated,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.160
and the epidemic of it, and the kind of ordinariness of it,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.160
is so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.160
or I have to take the time now, to process that.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.160
CA: There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.160
you know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
Why this one?

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
EE: I think that if you think about women,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.160
women are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth,

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.160
we come from them, they are mothers, they are visionaries,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.160
they are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160
that one out of three women on the planet

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
will be raped or beaten in their lifetime,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.160
we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
we're talking about the place where we come from, we're talking about parenting.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.160
Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.160
How does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.160
or thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.160
if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.160
it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself.
