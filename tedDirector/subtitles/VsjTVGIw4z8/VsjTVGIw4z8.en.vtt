00:00:12.543 --> 00:00:15.286
On March 10, 2011,

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:18.293
I was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Lab

00:00:18.293 --> 00:00:21.522
meeting with faculty, students and staff,

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.311
and we were trying to figure out whether

00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:25.671
I should be the next director.

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:28.040
That night, at midnight,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.810
a magnitude 9 earthquake

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.676
hit off of the Pacific coast of Japan.

00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:34.961
My wife and family were in Japan,

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:38.271
and as the news started to come in,

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:39.970
I was panicking.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.232
I was looking at the news streams

00:00:41.232 --> 00:00:44.060
and listening to the press conferences

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.270
of the government officials

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.860
and the Tokyo Power Company,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.411
and hearing about this explosion

00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:51.610
at the nuclear reactors

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.291
and this cloud of fallout

00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:55.190
that was headed towards our house

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.089
which was only about 200 kilometers away.

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.920
And the people on TV weren't telling us

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.860
anything that we wanted to hear.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.820
I wanted to know what was going on with the reactor,

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.242
what was going on with the radiation,

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:08.570
whether my family was in danger.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.759
So I did what instinctively felt like the right thing,

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.430
which was to go onto the Internet

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.772
and try to figure out

00:01:14.772 --> 00:01:17.183
if I could take matters into my own hands.

00:01:17.183 --> 00:01:19.024
On the Net, I found there were a lot of other people

00:01:19.024 --> 00:01:21.090
like me trying to figure out what was going on,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.306
and together we sort of loosely formed a group

00:01:23.306 --> 00:01:25.777
and we called it Safecast,

00:01:25.777 --> 00:01:26.949
and we decided we were going to try

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:28.695
to measure the radiation

00:01:28.695 --> 00:01:30.469
and get the data out to everybody else,

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.141
because it was clear that the government

00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:35.043
wasn't going to be doing this for us.

00:01:35.043 --> 00:01:36.460
Three years later,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.554
we have 16 million data points,

00:01:39.554 --> 00:01:42.299
we have designed our own Geiger counters

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.952
that you can download the designs

00:01:43.952 --> 00:01:44.826
and plug it into the network.

00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:46.730
We have an app that shows you

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.757
most of the radiation in Japan
and other parts of the world.

00:01:49.757 --> 00:01:51.962
We are arguably one of the most successful

00:01:51.962 --> 00:01:53.817
citizen science projects in the world,

00:01:53.817 --> 00:01:56.169
and we have created

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:59.670
the largest open dataset of radiation measurements.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.412
And the interesting thing here

00:02:02.412 --> 00:02:07.060
is how did — (Applause) — Thank you.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.151
How did a bunch of amateurs

00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:11.320
who really didn't know what we were doing

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.009
somehow come together

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.193
and do what NGOs and the government

00:02:16.193 --> 00:02:18.611
were completely incapable of doing?

00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:21.369
And I would suggest that this has something to do

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:23.129
with the Internet. It's not a fluke.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.980
It wasn't luck, and it wasn't because it was us.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.398
It helped that it was an event

00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:29.033
that pulled everybody together,

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:30.791
but it was a new way of doing things

00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:32.870
that was enabled by the Internet

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.462
and a lot of the other things that were going on,

00:02:34.462 --> 00:02:36.475
and I want to talk a little bit about

00:02:36.475 --> 00:02:39.144
what those new principles are.

00:02:39.144 --> 00:02:43.952
So remember before the Internet? (Laughter)

00:02:43.952 --> 00:02:45.740
I call this B.I. Okay?

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.351
So, in B.I., life was simple.

00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:52.097
Things were Euclidian, Newtonian,

00:02:52.097 --> 00:02:53.556
somewhat predictable.

00:02:53.556 --> 00:02:55.966
People actually tried to predict the future,

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:57.680
even the economists.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.894
And then the Internet happened,

00:03:00.894 --> 00:03:02.965
and the world became extremely complex,

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:05.602
extremely low-cost, extremely fast,

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.720
and those Newtonian laws

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.519
that we so dearly cherished

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.716
turned out to be just local ordinances,

00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:13.467
and what we found was that in this

00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:16.080
completely unpredictable world

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.112
that most of the people who were surviving

00:03:18.112 --> 00:03:21.445
were working with sort of a different set of principles,

00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:24.076
and I want to talk a little bit about that.

00:03:24.076 --> 00:03:25.440
Before the Internet, if you remember,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.345
when we tried to create services,

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:28.371
what you would do is you'd create

00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:30.683
the hardware layer and the
network layer and the software

00:03:30.683 --> 00:03:32.711
and it would cost millions of dollars

00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:35.018
to do anything that was substantial.

00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:37.457
So when it costs millions of dollars
to do something substantial,

00:03:37.457 --> 00:03:39.529
what you would do is you'd get an MBA

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:40.987
who would write a plan

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:41.930
and get the money

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.674
from V.C.s or big companies,

00:03:43.674 --> 00:03:45.787
and then you'd hire the designers and the engineers,

00:03:45.787 --> 00:03:46.810
and they'd build the thing.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.429
This is the Before Internet, B.I., innovation model.

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:53.736
What happened after the Internet was

00:03:53.736 --> 00:03:55.492
the cost of innovation went down so much

00:03:55.492 --> 00:03:57.979
because the cost of collaboration,
the cost of distribution,

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.622
the cost of communication, and Moore's Law

00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:03.298
made it so that the cost of trying a new thing

00:04:03.298 --> 00:04:04.692
became nearly zero,

00:04:04.692 --> 00:04:06.961
and so you would have Google, Facebook, Yahoo,

00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:08.732
students that didn't have permission —

00:04:08.732 --> 00:04:10.105
permissionless innovation —

00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:11.725
didn't have permission, didn't have PowerPoints,

00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:13.828
they just built the thing,

00:04:13.828 --> 00:04:15.272
then they raised the money,

00:04:15.272 --> 00:04:17.473
and then they sort of figured out a business plan

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:19.830
and maybe later on they hired some MBAs.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.141
So the Internet caused innovation,

00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:23.265
at least in software and services,

00:04:23.265 --> 00:04:26.124
to go from an MBA-driven innovation model

00:04:26.124 --> 00:04:30.027
to a designer-engineer-driven innovation model,

00:04:30.027 --> 00:04:32.125
and it pushed innovation to the edges,

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:33.671
to the dorm rooms, to the startups,

00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:35.357
away from the large institutions,

00:04:35.357 --> 00:04:37.712
the stodgy old institutions that had the power

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:39.399
and the money and the authority.

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:42.008
And we all know this. We all know
this happened on the Internet.

00:04:42.008 --> 00:04:44.773
It turns out it's happening in other things, too.

00:04:44.773 --> 00:04:48.015
Let me give you some examples.

00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:50.800
So at the Media Lab, we don't just do hardware.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.842
We do all kinds of things.

00:04:51.842 --> 00:04:53.727
We do biology, we do hardware,

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:57.348
and Nicholas Negroponte
famously said, "Demo or die,"

00:04:57.348 --> 00:04:59.070
as opposed to "Publish or perish,"

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.313
which was the traditional academic way of thinking.

00:05:01.313 --> 00:05:04.875
And he often said, the demo only has to work once,

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:07.691
because the primary mode of us impacting the world

00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:09.469
was through large companies

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:10.732
being inspired by us

00:05:10.732 --> 00:05:14.248
and creating products like
the Kindle or Lego Mindstorms.

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:16.190
But today, with the ability

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.499
to deploy things into the real world at such low cost,

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:20.649
I'm changing the motto now,

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:22.462
and this is the official public statement.

00:05:22.462 --> 00:05:24.959
I'm officially saying, "Deploy or die."

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:27.180
You have to get the stuff into the real world

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.536
for it to really count,

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.415
and sometimes it will be large companies,

00:05:30.415 --> 00:05:32.372
and Nicholas can talk about satellites.

00:05:32.372 --> 00:05:33.658
(Applause)

00:05:33.658 --> 00:05:34.740
Thank you.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.514
But we should be getting out there ourselves

00:05:36.514 --> 00:05:40.098
and not depending on large
institutions to do it for us.

00:05:40.098 --> 00:05:42.800
So last year, we sent a bunch
of students to Shenzhen,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.380
and they sat on the factory floors

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.685
with the innovators in Shenzhen, and it was amazing.

00:05:46.685 --> 00:05:48.162
What was happening there

00:05:48.162 --> 00:05:50.346
was you would have these manufacturing devices,

00:05:50.346 --> 00:05:52.539
and they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints.

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.004
They were fiddling with the manufacturing equipment

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:58.214
and innovating right on the
manufacturing equipment.

00:05:58.214 --> 00:06:00.100
The factory was in the designer,

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.374
and the designer was literally in the factory.

00:06:02.374 --> 00:06:04.000
And so what you would do is,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.241
you'd go down to the stalls

00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:07.797
and you would see these cell phones.

00:06:07.797 --> 00:06:10.322
So instead of starting little websites

00:06:10.322 --> 00:06:11.870
like the kids in Palo Alto do,

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.410
the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.107
They make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto

00:06:17.107 --> 00:06:18.365
make websites,

00:06:18.365 --> 00:06:20.478
and so there's a rainforest

00:06:20.478 --> 00:06:22.034
of innovation going on in the cell phone.

00:06:22.034 --> 00:06:23.634
What they do is, they make a cell phone,

00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:25.858
go down to the stall, they sell some,

00:06:25.858 --> 00:06:28.183
they look at the other kids' stuff, go up,

00:06:28.183 --> 00:06:30.774
make a couple thousand more, go down.

00:06:30.774 --> 00:06:32.765
Doesn't this sound like a software thing?

00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:34.412
It sounds like agile software development,

00:06:34.412 --> 00:06:37.340
A/B testing and iteration,

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.423
and what we thought you could only do with software

00:06:39.423 --> 00:06:41.693
kids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:43.160
My next fellow, I hope, is going to be

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.645
one of these innovators from Shenzhen.

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:46.310
And so what you see is

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.279
that is pushing innovation to the edges.

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:50.384
We talk about 3D printers and stuff like that,

00:06:50.384 --> 00:06:52.375
and that's great, but this is Limor.

00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:54.634
She is one of our favorite graduates,

00:06:54.634 --> 00:06:56.710
and she is standing in front of a Samsung

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.543
Techwin Pick and Place Machine.

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:02.467
This thing can put 23,000 components per hour

00:07:02.467 --> 00:07:04.460
onto an electronics board.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.283
This is a factory in a box.

00:07:06.283 --> 00:07:08.781
So what used to take a factory full of workers

00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:09.800
working by hand

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.509
in this little box in New York,

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:12.559
she's able to have effectively —

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:14.192
She doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen

00:07:14.192 --> 00:07:15.436
to do this manufacturing.

00:07:15.436 --> 00:07:17.697
She can buy this box and she can manufacture it.

00:07:17.697 --> 00:07:19.940
So manufacturing, the cost of innovation,

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.630
the cost of prototyping, distribution,
manufacturing, hardware,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.093
is getting so low

00:07:24.093 --> 00:07:26.410
that innovation is being pushed to the edges

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.838
and students and startups are being able to build it.

00:07:28.838 --> 00:07:30.716
This is a recent thing, but this will happen

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:32.199
and this will change

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:34.624
just like it did with software.

00:07:34.624 --> 00:07:37.870
Sorona is a DuPont process

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.890
that uses a genetically engineered microbe

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.840
to turn corn sugar into polyester.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.318
It's 30 percent more efficient
than the fossil fuel method,

00:07:47.318 --> 00:07:50.977
and it's much better for the environment.

00:07:50.977 --> 00:07:52.382
Genetic engineering and bioengineering

00:07:52.382 --> 00:07:53.913
are creating a whole bunch

00:07:53.913 --> 00:07:55.671
of great new opportunities

00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:58.500
for chemistry, for computation, for memory.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.550
We will probably be doing a lot,
obviously doing health things,

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.754
but we will probably be growing chairs

00:08:02.754 --> 00:08:03.794
and buildings soon.

00:08:03.794 --> 00:08:07.704
The problem is, Sorona costs
about 400 million dollars

00:08:07.704 --> 00:08:09.085
and took seven years to build.

00:08:09.085 --> 00:08:12.164
It kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days.

00:08:12.164 --> 00:08:14.656
The thing is, the cost of innovation

00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:16.242
in bioengineering is also going down.

00:08:16.242 --> 00:08:18.211
This is desktop gene sequencer.

00:08:18.211 --> 00:08:21.765
It used to cost millions and millions
of dollars to sequence genes.

00:08:21.765 --> 00:08:23.509
Now you can do it on a desktop like this,

00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:25.602
and kids can do this in dorm rooms.

00:08:25.602 --> 00:08:28.290
This is Gen9 gene assembler,

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.369
and so right now when you try to print a gene,

00:08:30.369 --> 00:08:31.637
what you do is somebody in a factory

00:08:31.637 --> 00:08:33.577
with pipettes puts the thing together by hand,

00:08:33.577 --> 00:08:35.928
you have one error per 100 base pairs,

00:08:35.928 --> 00:08:38.504
and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money.

00:08:38.504 --> 00:08:39.890
This new device

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.564
assembles genes on a chip,

00:08:41.564 --> 00:08:43.713
and instead of one error per 100 base pairs,

00:08:43.713 --> 00:08:45.839
it's one error per 10,000 base pairs.

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:48.584
In this lab, we will have the world's capacity

00:08:48.584 --> 00:08:50.687
of gene printing within a year,

00:08:50.687 --> 00:08:53.299
200 million base pairs a year.

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.862
This is kind of like when we went

00:08:55.862 --> 00:08:58.123
from transistor radios wrapped by hand

00:08:58.123 --> 00:08:59.394
to the Pentium.

00:08:59.394 --> 00:09:01.790
This is going to become the
Pentium of bioengineering,

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.826
pushing bioengineering into the hands

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:06.427
of dorm rooms and startup companies.

00:09:06.427 --> 00:09:09.200
So it's happening in software and in hardware

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.163
and bioengineering,

00:09:10.163 --> 00:09:13.444
and so this is a fundamental new
way of thinking about innovation.

00:09:13.444 --> 00:09:16.121
It's a bottom-up innovation, it's democratic,

00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:18.325
it's chaotic, it's hard to control.

00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:20.632
It's not bad, but it's very different,

00:09:20.632 --> 00:09:22.599
and I think that the traditional rules that we have

00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:24.671
for institutions don't work anymore,

00:09:24.671 --> 00:09:26.350
and most of us here

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.433
operate with a different set of principles.

00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:32.269
One of my favorite principles is the power of pull,

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:34.560
which is the idea of pulling resources

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.326
from the network as you need them

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:38.171
rather than stocking them in the center

00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:39.756
and controlling everything.

00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:42.520
So in the case of the Safecast story,

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.362
I didn't know anything when
the earthquake happened,

00:09:44.362 --> 00:09:45.990
but I was able to find Sean

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.186
who was the hackerspace community organizer,

00:09:48.186 --> 00:09:49.972
and Peter, the analog hardware hacker

00:09:49.972 --> 00:09:51.688
who made our first Geiger counter,

00:09:51.688 --> 00:09:53.686
and Dan, who built the Three Mile Island

00:09:53.686 --> 00:09:57.020
monitoring system after the
Three Mile Island meltdown.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.406
And these people I wouldn't have been able to find

00:09:59.406 --> 00:10:01.840
beforehand and probably were better

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.967
that I found them just in time from the network.

00:10:04.967 --> 00:10:06.834
I'm a three-time college dropout,

00:10:06.834 --> 00:10:08.507
so learning over education

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:09.932
is very near and dear to my heart,

00:10:09.932 --> 00:10:12.456
but to me, education is what people do to you

00:10:12.456 --> 00:10:15.455
and learning is what you do to yourself.

00:10:15.455 --> 00:10:19.231
(Applause)

00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:20.990
And it feels like, and I'm biased,

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.787
it feels like they're trying to make you memorize

00:10:23.787 --> 00:10:26.901
the whole encyclopedia before
they let you go out and play,

00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:30.998
and to me, I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone,

00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:32.701
and it feels like they assume

00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:34.488
you're going to be on top of some mountain

00:10:34.488 --> 00:10:36.949
all by yourself with a number 2 pencil

00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:38.332
trying to figure out what to do

00:10:38.332 --> 00:10:40.448
when in fact you're always going to be connected,

00:10:40.448 --> 00:10:42.093
you're always going to have friends,

00:10:42.093 --> 00:10:44.052
and you can pull Wikipedia
up whenever you need it,

00:10:44.052 --> 00:10:47.500
and what you need to learn is how to learn.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.144
In the case of Safecast, a bunch of amateurs

00:10:50.144 --> 00:10:51.742
when we started three years ago,

00:10:51.742 --> 00:10:54.250
I would argue that we probably as a group

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.666
know more than any other organization

00:10:56.666 --> 00:10:59.875
about how to collect data and publish data

00:10:59.875 --> 00:11:02.647
and do citizen science.

00:11:02.647 --> 00:11:03.767
Compass over maps.

00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:07.492
So this one, the idea is that the cost of writing a plan

00:11:07.492 --> 00:11:10.595
or mapping something is getting so expensive

00:11:10.595 --> 00:11:13.768
and it's not very accurate or useful.

00:11:13.768 --> 00:11:16.880
So in the Safecast story, we
knew we needed to collect data,

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.303
we knew we wanted to publish the data,

00:11:19.303 --> 00:11:22.192
and instead of trying to come up with the exact plan,

00:11:22.192 --> 00:11:24.600
we first said, oh, let's get Geiger counters.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.366
Oh, they've run out.

00:11:26.366 --> 00:11:28.369
Let's build them. There aren't enough sensors.

00:11:28.369 --> 00:11:30.596
Okay, then we can make a mobile Geiger counter.

00:11:30.596 --> 00:11:32.643
We can drive around. We can get volunteers.

00:11:32.643 --> 00:11:34.522
We don't have enough money. Let's Kickstarter it.

00:11:34.522 --> 00:11:36.513
We could not have planned this whole thing,

00:11:36.513 --> 00:11:38.257
but by having a very strong compass,

00:11:38.257 --> 00:11:39.692
we eventually got to where we were going,

00:11:39.692 --> 00:11:42.110
and to me it's very similar to
agile software development,

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.468
but this idea of compasses is very important.

00:11:45.468 --> 00:11:47.409
So I think the good news is

00:11:47.409 --> 00:11:50.910
that even though the world is extremely complex,

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.302
what you need to do is very simple.

00:11:53.302 --> 00:11:56.000
I think it's about stopping this notion

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.572
that you need to plan everything,

00:11:57.572 --> 00:11:58.664
you need to stock everything,

00:11:58.664 --> 00:12:00.134
and you need to be so prepared,

00:12:00.134 --> 00:12:03.128
and focus on being connected,

00:12:03.128 --> 00:12:04.979
always learning,

00:12:04.979 --> 00:12:06.840
fully aware,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.620
and super present.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.566
So I don't like the word "futurist."

00:12:11.566 --> 00:12:17.181
I think we should be now-ists,

00:12:17.181 --> 00:12:19.227
like we are right now.

00:12:19.227 --> 00:12:21.070
Thank you.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.049
(Applause)
