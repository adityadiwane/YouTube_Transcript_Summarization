00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.856
Jenni Chang: When I told
my parents I was gay,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.056
the first thing they said to me was,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.296
"We're bringing you back to Taiwan."

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.000
(Laughter)

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.856
In their minds, my sexual orientation
was America's fault.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.816
The West had corrupted me
with divergent ideas,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.816
and if only my parents
had never left Taiwan,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.296
this would not have happened
to their only daughter.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.416
In truth, I wondered if they were right.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.496
Of course, there are gay people in Asia,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.736
just as there are gay people
in every part of the world.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.696
But is the idea of living an "out" life,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.376
in the "I'm gay, this is my spouse,
and we're proud of our lives together"

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.040
kind of way just a Western idea?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.856
If I had grown up in Taiwan,
or any place outside of the West,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.936
would I have found models
of happy, thriving LGBT people?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.627
Lisa Dazols: I had similar notions.

00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:07.856
As an HIV social worker in San Francisco,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.856
I had met many gay immigrants.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.056
They told me their stories
of persecution in their home countries,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.576
just for being gay,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.056
and the reasons
why they escaped to the US.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.216
I saw how this had beaten them down.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.256
After 10 years of doing this kind of work,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.736
I needed better stories for myself.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.776
I knew the world was far from perfect,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.120
but surely not every gay story was tragic.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.776
JC: So as a couple, we both had a need
to find stories of hope.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.736
So we set off on a mission
to travel the world

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.616
and look for the people
we finally termed as the "Supergays."

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.840
(Laughter)

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.216
These would be the LGBT individuals

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.576
who were doing something
extraordinary in the world.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.936
They would be courageous, resilient,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.896
and most of all, proud of who they were.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.216
They would be the kind of person
that I aspire to be.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.776
Our plan was to share their stories
to the world through film.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.376
LD: There was just one problem.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.456
We had zero reporting
and zero filmmaking experience.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.496
(Laughter)

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.856
We didn't even know
where to find the Supergays,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.976
so we just had to trust that we'd
figure it all out along the way.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.416
So we picked 15 countries
in Asia, Africa and South America,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.096
countries outside the West
that varied in terms of LGBT rights.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.376
We bought a camcorder,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.543
ordered a book
on how to make a documentary --

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:26.216
(Laughter)

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.776
you can learn a lot these days --

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.000
and set off on an around-the-world trip.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.256
JC: One of the first countries
that we traveled to was Nepal.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.776
Despite widespread poverty,
a decade-long civil war,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.896
and now recently,
a devastating earthquake,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.936
Nepal has made significant strides
in the fight for equality.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.016
One of the key figures
in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.336
A beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.536
Bhumika has had to overcome
being expelled from school

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.856
and getting incarcerated
because of her gender presentation.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.976
But, in 2007, Bhumika
and Nepal's LGBT rights organization

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.056
successfully petitioned
the Nepali Supreme Court

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.776
to protect against LGBT discrimination.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.016
Here's Bhumika:

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.776
(Video) BS: What I'm most proud of?

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.296
I'm a transgendered person.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.096
I'm so proud of my life.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.856
On December 21, 2007,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.536
the supreme court gave the decision
for the Nepal government

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.296
to give transgender identity cards

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.256
and same-sex marriage.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.576
LD: I can appreciate
Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.496
Something as simple
as using a public restroom

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.056
can be a huge challenge
when you don't fit in

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.136
to people's strict gender expectations.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.856
Traveling throughout Asia,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.416
I tended to freak out women
in public restrooms.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.856
They weren't used to seeing
someone like me.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.071
I had to come up with a strategy,
so that I could just pee in peace.

00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:55.376
(Laughter)

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.115
So anytime I would enter a restroom,

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.096
I would thrust out my chest
to show my womanly parts,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.256
and try to be as
non-threatening as possible.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.256
Putting out my hands and saying, "Hello",

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.960
just so that people
could hear my feminine voice.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.536
This all gets pretty exhausting,
but it's just who I am.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.360
I can't be anything else.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.536
JC: After Nepal, we traveled to India.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.096
On one hand, India is a Hindu society,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.016
without a tradition of homophobia.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.296
On the other hand, it is also a society
with a deeply patriarchal system,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.456
which rejects anything
that threatens the male-female order.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.096
When we spoke to activists,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.256
they told us that empowerment begins
with ensuring proper gender equality,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.336
where the women's status
is established in society.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.416
And in that way, the status of LGBT people
can be affirmed as well.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.896
LD: There we met Prince Manvendra.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.616
He's the world's first openly gay prince.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.176
Prince Manvendra came out
on the "Oprah Winfrey Show,"

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.456
very internationally.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.736
His parents disowned him

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.016
and accused him of bringing
great shame to the royal family.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.656
We sat down with Prince Manvendra

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.536
and talked to him about why he decided
to come out so very publicly.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.776
Here he is:

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.336
(Video) Prince Manvendra: 
I felt there was a lot of need

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.536
to break this stigma and discrimination
which is existing in our society.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.696
And that instigated me to come out openly
and talk about myself.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.176
Whether we are gay, we are lesbian,
we are transgender, bisexual

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.536
or whatever sexual minority we come from,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.616
we have to all unite
and fight for our rights.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.576
Gay rights cannot be won
in the court rooms,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.000
but in the hearts and the minds
of the people.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.656
JC: While getting my hair cut,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.936
the woman cutting my hair asked me,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.776
"Do you have a husband?"

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.576
Now, this was a dreaded question

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.176
that I got asked a lot
by locals while traveling.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.896
When I explained to her
that I was with a woman instead of a man,

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.256
she was incredulous,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.656
and she asked me a lot of questions
about my parents' reactions

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.200
and whether I was sad
that I'd never be able to have children.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.056
I told her that there are
no limitations to my life

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.120
and that Lisa and I do plan
to have a family some day.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.416
Now, this woman was ready to write me off

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.480
as yet another crazy Westerner.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.296
She couldn't imagine
that such a phenomenon

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.336
could happen in her own country.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.980
That is, until I showed her
the photos of the Supergays

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:20.484
that we interviewed in India.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.016
She recognized Prince Manvendra
from television

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.279
and soon I had an audience
of other hairdressers

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:27.494
interested in meeting me.

00:06:27.518 --> 00:06:29.376
(Laughter)

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.696
And in that ordinary afternoon,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.656
I had the chance to introduce
an entire beauty salon

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.360
to the social changes
that were happening in their own country.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.136
LD: From India,
we traveled to East Africa,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.136
a region known for intolerance
towards LGBT people.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.656
In Kenya, 89 percent of people
who come out to their families

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.976
are disowned.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.696
Homosexual acts are a crime
and can lead to incarceration.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.376
In Kenya, we met
the soft-spoken David Kuria.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.336
David had a huge mission
of wanting to work for the poor

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.096
and improve his own government.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.256
So he decided to run for senate.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.936
He became Kenya's first
openly gay political candidate.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.616
David wanted to run his campaign
without denying the reality of who he was.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.296
But we were worried for his safety

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.576
because he started
to receive death threats.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.216
(Video) David Kuria: 
At that point, I was really scared

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.016
because they were
actually asking for me to be killed.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.856
And, yeah,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.136
there are some people out there who do it

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.827
and they feel that they are doing
a religious obligation.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.376
JC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.256
Even in the face of threats,

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.480
he stayed authentic.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.096
LD: At the opposite end
of the spectrum is Argentina.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.416
Argentina's a country where 92 percent
of the population identifies as Catholic.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.136
Yet, Argentina has LGBT laws
that are even more progressive

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.496
than here in the US.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.936
In 2010, Argentina became
the first country in Latin America

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.800
and the 10th in the world
to adopt marriage equality.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.656
There, we met María Rachid.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.296
María was a driving force
behind that movement.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.856
María Rachid (Spanish):
I always say that, in reality,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.456
the effects of marriage equality

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.736
are not only for those couples
that get married.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.256
They are for a lot of people that,
even though they may never get married,

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.616
will be perceived differently
by their coworkers,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.696
their families and neighbors,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.176
from the national state's
message of equality.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.056
I feel very proud of Argentina

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.096
because Argentina today
is a model of equality.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.696
And hopefully soon,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.656
the whole world will have the same rights.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.416
JC: When we made the visit
to my ancestral lands,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.496
I wish I could have shown
my parents what we found there.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.456
Because here is who we met:

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.616
(Video) One, two, three.
Welcome gays to Shanghai!

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.080
(Laughter)

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.016
A whole community of young,
beautiful Chinese LGBT people.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.536
Sure, they had their struggles.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.816
But they were fighting it out.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.896
In Shanghai, I had the chance
to speak to a local lesbian group

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.576
and tell them our story
in my broken Mandarin Chinese.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.256
In Taipei, each time
we got onto the metro,

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.456
we saw yet another
lesbian couple holding hands.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.616
And we learned that Asia's
largest LGBT pride event

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.016
happens just blocks away
from where my grandparents live.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.760
If only my parents knew.

00:09:33.387 --> 00:09:36.816
LD: By the time we finished our
not-so-straight journey around the world,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.056
(Laughter)

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.776
we had traveled 50,000 miles

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.456
and logged 120 hours of video footage.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.976
We traveled to 15 countries

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.056
and interviewed 50 Supergays.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.720
Turns out, it wasn't hard
to find them at all.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.976
JC: Yes, there are still
tragedies that happen

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.256
on the bumpy road to equality.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.080
And let's not forget that 75 countries
still criminalize homosexuality today.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.336
But there are also stories
of hope and courage

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.520
in every corner of the world.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.696
What we ultimately took away
from our journey is,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.440
equality is not a Western invention.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.136
LD: One of the key factors
in this equality movement is momentum,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.536
momentum as more and more people
embrace their full selves

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.696
and use whatever opportunities they have

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.936
to change their part of the world,

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.176
and momentum as more and more countries

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.176
find models of equality in one another.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.736
When Nepal protected
against LGBT discrimination,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.536
India pushed harder.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.456
When Argentina embraced marriage equality,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.696
Uruguay and Brazil followed.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.656
When Ireland said yes to equality,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.736
(Applause)

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.696
the world stopped to notice.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.376
When the US Supreme Court
makes a statement to the world

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.736
that we can all be proud of.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.280
(Applause)

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.096
JC: As we reviewed our footage,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.056
what we realized is that
we were watching a love story.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.856
It wasn't a love story
that was expected of me,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.216
but it is one filled
with more freedom, adventure and love

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.176
than I could have ever possibly imagined.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.736
One year after returning home
from our trip,

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.736
marriage equality came to California.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.520
And in the end, we believe,
love will win out.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.416
(Video) By the power vested in me,

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.016
by the state of California

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.296
and by God Almighty,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.656
I now pronounce you spouses for life.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.896
You may kiss.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.800
(Applause)
