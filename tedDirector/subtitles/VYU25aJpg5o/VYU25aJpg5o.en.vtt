00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:17.293
In December of 2010,

00:00:17.293 --> 00:00:19.110
the city of Apatzing치n

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.262
in the coastal state of Michoac치n, in Mexico,

00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:24.632
awoke to gunfire.

00:00:24.632 --> 00:00:26.208
For two straight days,

00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:28.626
the city became an open battlefield

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:30.410
between the federal forces

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.079
and a well-organized group,

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.862
presumably from the local criminal organization,

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:38.234
La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoac치n family.

00:00:38.234 --> 00:00:41.384
The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire

00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:43.804
but also explosions

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:47.075
and burning trucks used as barricades across the city,

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.092
so truly like a battlefield.

00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:50.622
After these two days,

00:00:50.622 --> 00:00:53.427
and during a particularly intense encounter,

00:00:53.427 --> 00:00:55.994
it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,

00:00:55.994 --> 00:00:58.499
Nazario Moreno, was killed.

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.510
In response to this terrifying violence,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.509
the mayor of Apatzing치n

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:04.809
decided to call the citizens to a march for peace.

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.156
The idea was to ask for a softer approach

00:01:08.156 --> 00:01:10.574
to criminal activity in the state.

00:01:10.574 --> 00:01:13.768
And so, the day of the scheduled procession,

00:01:13.768 --> 00:01:15.622
thousands of people showed up.

00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:17.316
As the mayor was preparing to deliver

00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:19.427
the speech starting the march,

00:01:19.427 --> 00:01:20.929
his team noticed

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.087
that, while half of the participants

00:01:24.087 --> 00:01:25.762
were appropriately dressed in white,

00:01:25.762 --> 00:01:28.602
and bearing banners asking for peace,

00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:30.771
the other half was actually marching

00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:33.862
in support of the criminal organization

00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:37.046
and its now-presumed-defunct leader.

00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:40.115
Shocked, the mayor decided to step aside

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:42.126
rather than participate or lead a procession

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:45.511
that was ostensibly in support of organized crime.

00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:47.753
And so his team stepped aside.

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:49.829
The two marches joined together,

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.834
and they continued their path

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:55.444
towards the state capital.

00:01:55.444 --> 00:02:00.255
This story of horrific violence

00:02:00.255 --> 00:02:02.452
followed by a fumbled approach

00:02:02.452 --> 00:02:04.647
by federal and local authorities as they tried

00:02:04.647 --> 00:02:06.070
to engage civil society,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.426
who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,

00:02:09.426 --> 00:02:12.890
is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.239
where we see that our current understanding

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.607
of drug violence and what leads to it

00:02:18.607 --> 00:02:21.209
is probably at the very least incomplete.

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.212
If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying

00:02:23.212 --> 00:02:25.242
to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico

00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:27.881
by, say, just researching online,

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.722
the first thing you would find out is that

00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:33.689
while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:34.808
there are some that are more

00:02:34.808 --> 00:02:38.167
and there are some that are much less equal than others,

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:39.418
because you will quickly find out

00:02:39.418 --> 00:02:41.122
that in the past six years

00:02:41.122 --> 00:02:43.270
anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.828
have lost their lives in drug-related violence.

00:02:46.828 --> 00:02:48.575
To put these numbers in perspective,

00:02:48.575 --> 00:02:51.391
this is eight times larger than the number of casualties

00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:55.912
in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.

00:02:55.912 --> 00:02:58.416
It's also shockingly close to the number of people

00:02:58.416 --> 00:03:00.942
who have died in the Syrian civil war,

00:03:00.942 --> 00:03:03.155
which is an active civil war.

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:06.351
This is happening just south of the border.

00:03:06.351 --> 00:03:07.955
Now as you're reading, however,

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:09.638
you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly

00:03:09.638 --> 00:03:11.674
become numb to the numbers of deaths,

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:15.360
because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.953
of faceless, nameless dead people.

00:03:18.953 --> 00:03:21.677
Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative

00:03:21.677 --> 00:03:23.512
that all the people who are dying

00:03:23.512 --> 00:03:26.368
were somehow involved in the drug trade,

00:03:26.368 --> 00:03:29.964
and we infer this because they were either tortured

00:03:29.964 --> 00:03:32.125
or executed in a professional manner,

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:33.777
or, most likely, both.

00:03:33.777 --> 00:03:35.758
And so clearly they were criminals

00:03:35.758 --> 00:03:38.373
because of the way they died.

00:03:38.373 --> 00:03:40.936
And so the narrative is that somehow these people

00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:42.179
got what they were deserved.

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.630
They were part of the bad guys.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.178
And that creates some form of comfort

00:03:47.178 --> 00:03:48.810
for a lot of people.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.774
However, while it's easier to think

00:03:51.774 --> 00:03:55.759
of us, the citizens, the police, the army,

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:59.331
as the good guys, and them, the narcos,

00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:02.625
the carteles, as the bad guys,

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:03.791
if you think about it,

00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:07.599
the latter are only providing a service to the former.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.714
Whether we like it or not,

00:04:09.714 --> 00:04:12.375
the U.S. is the largest market

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:13.993
for illegal substances in the world,

00:04:13.993 --> 00:04:17.047
accounting for more than half of global demand.

00:04:17.047 --> 00:04:20.307
It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico

00:04:20.307 --> 00:04:23.425
that is its only route of access from the South,

00:04:23.425 --> 00:04:26.480
and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.209
used to say, "Poor Mexico,

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:35.401
so far from God and so close to the United States."

00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:38.250
The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.717
of illegal drugs in the United States.

00:04:40.717 --> 00:04:43.143
Using very, very conservative assumptions,

00:04:43.143 --> 00:04:46.240
this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.023
of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:51.692
If we assume that the narcos only have access

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:54.416
to the wholesale part, which we know is false,

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:56.757
that still leaves you with yearly revenues

00:04:56.757 --> 00:05:01.275
of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.

00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:03.191
To put these numbers in perspective,

00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:07.984
Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.

00:05:07.984 --> 00:05:10.490
And it so happens that this is a product that,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.465
because of its nature, a business model

00:05:13.465 --> 00:05:16.219
to address this market requires you

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:18.348
to guarantee to your producers

00:05:18.348 --> 00:05:20.966
that their product will be reliably placed

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:23.083
in the markets where it is consumed.

00:05:23.083 --> 00:05:26.640
And the only way to do this, because it's illegal,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.650
is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.949
that are used to transport drugs.

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.466
Hence the violence.

00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:37.498
If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,

00:05:37.498 --> 00:05:39.618
you will see that it almost perfectly aligns

00:05:39.618 --> 00:05:41.402
with the most efficient routes of transportation

00:05:41.402 --> 00:05:43.297
from the south to the north.

00:05:43.297 --> 00:05:44.453
The only thing that the cartels are doing

00:05:44.453 --> 00:05:47.204
is that they're trying to protect their business.

00:05:47.204 --> 00:05:49.629
It's not only a multi-billion dollar market,

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:51.724
but it's also a complex one.

00:05:51.724 --> 00:05:54.433
For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant

00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:56.764
that can only grow in certain latitudes,

00:05:56.764 --> 00:05:58.500
and so it means that a business model

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.235
to address this market requires you to have

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:02.756
decentralized, international production,

00:06:02.756 --> 00:06:05.300
that by the way needs to have good quality control,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.801
because people need a good high

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.386
that is not going to kill them

00:06:09.386 --> 00:06:12.248
and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.

00:06:12.248 --> 00:06:14.241
And so that means they need to secure

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:17.143
production and quality control in the south,

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:19.150
and you need to ensure that you have

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.642
efficient and effective distribution channels

00:06:21.642 --> 00:06:25.081
in the markets where these drugs are consumed.

00:06:25.081 --> 00:06:26.672
I urge you, but only a little bit,

00:06:26.672 --> 00:06:28.883
because I don't want to get you in trouble,

00:06:28.883 --> 00:06:32.169
to just ask around and see how difficult it would be

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.026
to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,

00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:37.971
whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,

00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:40.784
and some of you may be surprised to know

00:06:40.784 --> 00:06:42.798
that there are many dealers that offer a service

00:06:42.798 --> 00:06:44.622
where if you send them a text message,

00:06:44.622 --> 00:06:46.327
they guarantee delivery of the drug

00:06:46.327 --> 00:06:49.209
in 30 minutes or less.

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:51.630
Think about this for a second.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.361
Think about the complexity

00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:56.761
of the distribution network that I just described.

00:06:56.761 --> 00:06:59.259
It's very difficult to reconcile this

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.381
with the image of faceless, ignorant goons

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.986
that are just shooting each other,

00:07:05.986 --> 00:07:07.674
very difficult to reconcile.

00:07:07.674 --> 00:07:11.003
Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,

00:07:11.003 --> 00:07:13.678
an effective organization requires

00:07:13.678 --> 00:07:15.587
an integrated strategy that includes

00:07:15.587 --> 00:07:18.460
a good organizational structure, good incentives,

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.452
a solid identity and good brand management.

00:07:21.452 --> 00:07:23.587
This leads me to the second thing that you would learn

00:07:23.587 --> 00:07:26.487
in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.

00:07:26.487 --> 00:07:28.049
Because you would quickly realize,

00:07:28.049 --> 00:07:29.712
and maybe be confused by the fact,

00:07:29.712 --> 00:07:30.949
that there are three organizations

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:34.484
that are constantly named in the articles.

00:07:34.484 --> 00:07:36.558
You will hear about Los Zetas,

00:07:36.558 --> 00:07:38.529
the Knights Templar, which is the new brand

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:41.387
for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,

00:07:41.387 --> 00:07:43.761
and the Sinaloa Federation.

00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:46.552
You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment

00:07:46.552 --> 00:07:50.907
of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter

00:07:50.907 --> 00:07:53.033
and they silence the press,

00:07:53.033 --> 00:07:56.407
and this is somewhat true, or mostly true.

00:07:56.407 --> 00:08:00.486
But this is the result of a very careful branding

00:08:00.486 --> 00:08:02.287
and business strategy.

00:08:02.287 --> 00:08:04.456
You see, Los Zetas is not just

00:08:04.456 --> 00:08:06.256
this random assortment of individuals,

00:08:06.256 --> 00:08:09.911
but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,

00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:12.923
that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.

00:08:12.923 --> 00:08:15.337
When that corridor became contested, they decided

00:08:15.337 --> 00:08:17.127
that they wanted to recruit

00:08:17.127 --> 00:08:19.958
a professional enforcement arm.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.567
So they recruited Los Zetas:

00:08:23.567 --> 00:08:26.325
an entire unit of elite paratroopers

00:08:26.325 --> 00:08:29.342
from the Mexican Army.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:33.048
They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,

00:08:33.048 --> 00:08:34.936
so much so that at some point, they decided

00:08:34.936 --> 00:08:37.429
to just take over the operations,

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:41.223
which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,

00:08:41.223 --> 00:08:43.864
because they grow up.

00:08:43.864 --> 00:08:47.560
Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.496
they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:52.703
in the most profitable markets like cocaine,

00:08:52.703 --> 00:08:53.993
but what they did have,

00:08:53.993 --> 00:08:56.453
and this is again based on their military origin,

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:59.300
was a perfectly structured chain of command

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.925
with a very clear hierarchy

00:09:01.925 --> 00:09:05.989
and a very clear promotion path that allowed them

00:09:05.989 --> 00:09:09.811
to supervise and operate across many, many markets

00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:11.453
very effectively,

00:09:11.453 --> 00:09:15.252
which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.

00:09:15.252 --> 00:09:16.541
And so because they didn't have access

00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:18.876
to the more profitable drug markets,

00:09:18.876 --> 00:09:20.549
this pushed them and gave them the opportunity

00:09:20.549 --> 00:09:24.047
to diversify into other forms of crime.

00:09:24.047 --> 00:09:28.102
That includes kidnapping, prostitution,

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:30.283
local drug dealing and human trafficking,

00:09:30.283 --> 00:09:34.239
including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.

00:09:34.239 --> 00:09:38.487
So what they currently run is truly

00:09:38.487 --> 00:09:42.059
and quite literally a franchise business.

00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:45.890
They focus most of their recruiting on the army,

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.967
and they very openly advertise for better salaries,

00:09:48.967 --> 00:09:51.665
better benefits, better promotion paths,

00:09:51.665 --> 00:09:53.313
not to mention much better food,

00:09:53.313 --> 00:09:56.020
than what the army can deliver.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.889
The way they operate is that

00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.794
when they arrive in a locality,

00:09:59.794 --> 00:10:01.545
they let people know that they are there,

00:10:01.545 --> 00:10:04.615
and they go to the most powerful local gang

00:10:04.615 --> 00:10:06.855
and they say, "I offer you

00:10:06.855 --> 00:10:10.044
to be the local representative of the Zeta brand."

00:10:10.044 --> 00:10:11.917
If they agree -- and you don't want to know

00:10:11.917 --> 00:10:13.660
what happens if they don't --

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.347
they train them and they supervise them

00:10:15.347 --> 00:10:18.674
on how to run the most efficient criminal operation

00:10:18.674 --> 00:10:22.175
for that town, in exchange for royalties.

00:10:22.175 --> 00:10:24.081
This kind of business model obviously depends

00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:26.478
entirely on having a very effective brand of fear,

00:10:26.478 --> 00:10:28.851
and so Los Zetas

00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:31.144
carefully stage acts of violence

00:10:31.144 --> 00:10:33.077
that are spectacular in nature,

00:10:33.077 --> 00:10:35.877
especially when they arrive first in a city,

00:10:35.877 --> 00:10:39.111
but again, that's just a brand strategy.

00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:41.010
I'm not saying they're not violent,

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.953
but what I am saying is that even though you will read

00:10:42.953 --> 00:10:44.816
that they are the most violent of all,

00:10:44.816 --> 00:10:47.779
when you count, when you do the body count,

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:51.551
they're actually all the same.

00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:54.639
In contrast to them, the Knights Templar

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:56.479
that arose in Michoac치n

00:10:56.479 --> 00:10:59.086
emerged in reaction to the incursion

00:10:59.086 --> 00:11:01.621
of the Zetas into the state of Michoac치n.

00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:04.538
Michoac치n is a geographically strategic state

00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:06.541
because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:09.132
and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,

00:11:09.132 --> 00:11:12.198
which then gives you direct access to the U.S.

00:11:12.198 --> 00:11:13.737
The Knights Templar realized very quickly

00:11:13.737 --> 00:11:17.245
that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone,

00:11:17.245 --> 00:11:19.602
and so they developed a strategy

00:11:19.602 --> 00:11:22.381
as a social enterprise.

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:25.381
They brand themselves as representative of

00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:28.037
and protecting of the citizens of Michoac치n

00:11:28.037 --> 00:11:30.335
against organized crime.

00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:32.066
Their brand of social enterprise means

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:34.117
that they require a lot of civic engagement,

00:11:34.117 --> 00:11:38.283
so they invest heavily in providing local services,

00:11:38.283 --> 00:11:41.781
like dealing with home violence,

00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:45.557
going after petty criminals, treating addicts,

00:11:45.557 --> 00:11:48.335
and keeping drugs out of the local markets

00:11:48.335 --> 00:11:50.815
where they are,

00:11:50.815 --> 00:11:52.434
and, of course, protecting people

00:11:52.434 --> 00:11:54.925
from other criminal organizations.

00:11:54.925 --> 00:11:57.956
Now, they kill a lot of people too,

00:11:57.956 --> 00:12:00.053
but when they kill them,

00:12:00.068 --> 00:12:02.968
they provide very careful narratives and descriptions

00:12:02.968 --> 00:12:04.220
for why they did them,

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.183
through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,

00:12:08.183 --> 00:12:10.649
and billboards that explain that the people who were killed

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:12.977
were killed because they represented a threat

00:12:12.977 --> 00:12:14.833
not to us, as an organization, of course,

00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:16.769
but to you, as citizens.

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:19.225
And so we're actually here to protect you.

00:12:19.225 --> 00:12:21.789
They, as social enterprises do,

00:12:21.789 --> 00:12:23.289
have created a moral and ethical code

00:12:23.289 --> 00:12:25.658
that they advertise around,

00:12:25.658 --> 00:12:28.796
and they have very strict recruiting practices.

00:12:28.796 --> 00:12:30.619
And here you have the types of explanations

00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:34.560
that they provide for some of their actions.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.456
They have actually retained access

00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:38.756
to the profitable drug trade,

00:12:38.756 --> 00:12:40.966
but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoac치n,

00:12:40.966 --> 00:12:43.109
and they control the Port of L치zaro C치rdenas,

00:12:43.109 --> 00:12:44.911
they leverage that to, for example,

00:12:44.911 --> 00:12:48.468
trade copper from Michoac치n that is legally created

00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:49.868
and legally extracted

00:12:49.868 --> 00:12:51.870
with illegal ephedrine from China

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.294
which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines

00:12:55.294 --> 00:12:57.694
that they produce, and then they have partnerships

00:12:57.694 --> 00:13:00.232
with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation

00:13:00.232 --> 00:13:02.922
that place their products in the U.S.

00:13:02.922 --> 00:13:05.593
Finally, the Sinaloa Federation.

00:13:05.593 --> 00:13:07.791
When you read about them, you will often read about them

00:13:07.791 --> 00:13:11.491
with an undertone of reverence and admiration,

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.407
because they are the most integrated

00:13:13.407 --> 00:13:15.695
and the largest of all the Mexican organizations,

00:13:15.695 --> 00:13:19.149
and, many people argue, the world.

00:13:19.149 --> 00:13:22.133
They started as just sort of a transport organization

00:13:22.133 --> 00:13:24.207
that specialized in smuggling between the U.S.

00:13:24.207 --> 00:13:26.332
and the Mexican borders,

00:13:26.332 --> 00:13:27.750
but now they have grown

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:31.176
into a truly integrated multinational

00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:33.482
that has partnerships in production in the south

00:13:33.482 --> 00:13:36.495
and partnerships in global distribution

00:13:36.495 --> 00:13:38.989
across the planet.

00:13:38.989 --> 00:13:42.319
They have cultivated a brand of professionalism,

00:13:42.319 --> 00:13:45.637
business acumen and innovation.

00:13:45.637 --> 00:13:47.736
They have designed new drug products

00:13:47.736 --> 00:13:49.459
and new drug processes.

00:13:49.459 --> 00:13:51.677
They have designed narco-tunnels

00:13:51.677 --> 00:13:53.218
that go across the border,

00:13:53.218 --> 00:13:55.033
and you can see that these are not

00:13:55.033 --> 00:13:58.981
"The Shawshank Redemption" types.

00:13:58.981 --> 00:14:02.677
They have invented narco-submarines and boats

00:14:02.677 --> 00:14:05.360
that are not detected by radar.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.923
They have invented drones to transport drugs,

00:14:07.923 --> 00:14:11.209
catapults, you name it.

00:14:11.209 --> 00:14:13.550
One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.988
actually made it to the Forbes list.

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:17.961
[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]

00:14:17.961 --> 00:14:20.866
Like any multinational would, they have specialized

00:14:20.866 --> 00:14:23.155
and focused only in the most profitable part of the business,

00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:25.833
which is high-margin drugs like cocaine,

00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:28.118
heroine, methamphetamines.

00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:30.691
Like any traditional Latin American multinational would,

00:14:30.691 --> 00:14:32.432
the way they control their operations

00:14:32.432 --> 00:14:34.214
is through family ties.

00:14:34.214 --> 00:14:36.159
When they're entering a new market, they send

00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:37.880
a family member to supervise it,

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.697
or, if they're partnering with a new organization,

00:14:40.697 --> 00:14:42.117
they create a family tie,

00:14:42.117 --> 00:14:46.583
either through marriages or other types of ties.

00:14:46.583 --> 00:14:48.746
Like any other multinational would,

00:14:48.746 --> 00:14:51.913
they protect their brand by outsourcing

00:14:51.913 --> 00:14:54.081
the more questionable parts of the business model,

00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:56.124
like for example, when they have to engage

00:14:56.124 --> 00:14:58.889
in violence against other criminal organizations,

00:14:58.889 --> 00:15:02.334
they recruit gangs and other smaller players

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:04.133
to do the dirty work for them,

00:15:04.133 --> 00:15:05.918
and they try to separate their operations

00:15:05.918 --> 00:15:09.553
and their violence and be very discrete about this.

00:15:09.553 --> 00:15:12.049
To further strengthen their brand,

00:15:12.049 --> 00:15:14.942
they actually have professional P.R. firms

00:15:14.942 --> 00:15:17.421
that shape how the press talks about them.

00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:20.972
They have professional videographers on staff.

00:15:20.972 --> 00:15:23.085
They have incredibly productive ties

00:15:23.085 --> 00:15:24.918
with the security organizations

00:15:24.918 --> 00:15:28.330
on both sides of the border.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.931
And so, differences aside,

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:34.486
what these three organizations share

00:15:34.486 --> 00:15:38.126
is on the one hand, a very clear understanding

00:15:38.126 --> 00:15:41.210
that institutions cannot be imposed from the top,

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.150
but rather they are built from the bottom up

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.433
one interaction at a time.

00:15:47.433 --> 00:15:49.854
They have created extremely coherent structures

00:15:49.854 --> 00:15:52.688
that they use to show the inconsistencies

00:15:52.688 --> 00:15:56.715
in government policies.

00:15:56.715 --> 00:15:59.202
And so what I want you to remember from this talk

00:15:59.202 --> 00:16:00.735
are three things.

00:16:00.735 --> 00:16:03.791
The first one is that drug violence

00:16:03.791 --> 00:16:05.668
is actually the result

00:16:05.668 --> 00:16:08.919
of a huge market demand

00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:12.569
and an institutional setup that forces

00:16:12.569 --> 00:16:15.695
the servicing of this market to necessitate violence

00:16:15.695 --> 00:16:19.740
to guarantee delivery routes.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.666
The second thing I want you to remember

00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:23.612
is that these are sophisticated,

00:16:23.612 --> 00:16:26.535
coherent organizations

00:16:26.535 --> 00:16:28.493
that are business organizations,

00:16:28.493 --> 00:16:30.412
and analyzing them and treating them as such

00:16:30.412 --> 00:16:33.801
is probably a much more useful approach.

00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:35.937
The third thing I want you to remember

00:16:35.937 --> 00:16:37.365
is that even though we're more comfortable

00:16:37.365 --> 00:16:39.888
with this idea of "them,"

00:16:39.888 --> 00:16:42.629
a set of bad guys separated from us,

00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:45.606
we are actually accomplices to them,

00:16:45.606 --> 00:16:47.995
either through our direct consumption

00:16:47.995 --> 00:16:52.067
or through our acceptance of the inconsistency

00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:54.335
between our policies of prohibition

00:16:54.335 --> 00:16:57.283
and our actual behavior of tolerance

00:16:57.283 --> 00:17:01.507
or even encouragement of consumption.

00:17:01.507 --> 00:17:05.527
These organizations service, recruit from,

00:17:05.527 --> 00:17:07.855
and operate within our communities,

00:17:07.855 --> 00:17:10.273
so necessarily, they are much more integrated

00:17:10.273 --> 00:17:14.743
within them than we are comfortable acknowledging.

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:17.608
And so to me the question is not whether

00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:20.889
these dynamics will continue the way they have.

00:17:20.889 --> 00:17:23.654
We see that the nature of this phenomenon

00:17:23.654 --> 00:17:26.122
guarantees that they will.

00:17:26.122 --> 00:17:29.002
The question is whether we are willing to continue

00:17:29.002 --> 00:17:33.608
our support of a failed strategy

00:17:33.608 --> 00:17:39.115
based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance

00:17:39.115 --> 00:17:44.076
at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.

00:17:44.076 --> 00:17:45.807
Thank you.

00:17:45.807 --> 00:17:50.969
(Applause)
