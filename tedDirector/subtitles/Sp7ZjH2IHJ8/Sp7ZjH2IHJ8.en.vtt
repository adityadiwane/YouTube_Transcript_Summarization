00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
I'm going to go right into the slides.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
is that I do just very straight stuff.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
And my ideas are --

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
in my head, anyway -- they're very logical

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.160
and relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.160
I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
or I really do solve their problems,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
because usually they seem to like it.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.160
Let me go right into the slides.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.160
Can you turn off the light? Down.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
I like to be in the dark.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
I don't want you to see what I'm doing up here.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
(Laughter)

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
Anyway, I did this house in Santa Monica,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
and it got a lot of notoriety.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
In fact, it appeared in a porno comic book,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
which is the slide on the right.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.160
(Laughter)

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
This is in Venice.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
I just show it because I want you to know

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
I'm concerned about context.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
On the left-hand side,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
I had the context of those little houses,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
and I tried to build a building that fit into that context.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.160
When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
they look really weird,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
and my premise is that they make a lot more sense

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.160
when they're photographed or seen in that space.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.160
And then, once I deal with the context,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.160
I then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.160
as I hope you'll find that slide on the right.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.160
And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
I was concerned about making a place for the study of law.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.160
And we continue to work with this client.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.160
The building on the right at the top is now under construction.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.160
The garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.160
finally, and several small classrooms will be placed

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.160
along this avenue that we've created, this campus.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.160
And it all related to the clients and the students

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.160
from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
They wanted a sense of place.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.160
in downtown, in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.160
And it was my theory, or my point of view,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.160
that one didn't upstage the neighborhood --

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
one made accommodations.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
I tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
whether they were buildings I liked or not.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
In the '60s I started working with paper furniture

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.160
and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.160
We even made flooring, walls and everything, out of cardboard.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.160
And the success of it threw me for a loop.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
I couldn't deal with the success of furniture --

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
I wasn't secure enough as an architect --

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.160
and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.160
(Laughter)

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
So, nobody would like this.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.160
And it was in this, preliminary to these pieces of furniture,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.160
that Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.160
And after we failed, I just kept failing.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:21.160
(Laughter)

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
The piece on the left --

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
and that ultimately led to the piece on the right --

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
happened when the kid that was working on this

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
to put it in the wastebasket.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
And I put a piece of tape around it,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160
as you see there, and realized you could sit on it,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
So, it was an accidental discovery.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
I got into fish.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:03.160
(Laughter)

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.160
I mean, the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo --

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.160
and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
and if you're going to go back, we might as well go back to the beginning.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.160
And so I started making these funny things.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.160
And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger --

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
as the one glass at the Walker.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.160
And then, I sliced off the head and the tail and everything

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
and tried to translate what I was learning

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
about the form of the fish and the movement.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it --

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
accidental, again --

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.160
it was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.160
and made this proposal for a building, which was only a proposal.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.160
I did this building in Japan.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
I was taken out to dinner after the contract

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
for this little restaurant was signed.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.160
And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.160
And after I got -- I was really drunk --

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.160
I was asked to do some sketches on napkins.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.160
(Laughter)

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.160
And I made some sketches on napkins --

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
little boxes and Morandi-like things that I used to do.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.160
And the client said, "Why no fish?"

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.160
And so I made a drawing with a fish, and I left Japan.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
Three weeks later, I received a complete set of drawings

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
saying we'd won the competition.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:58.160
(Laughter)

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.160
Now, it's hard to do. It's hard to translate a fish form,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
because they're so beautiful -- perfect --

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160
into a building or object like this.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.160
And Oldenburg, who I work with a little once in a while,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.160
told me I couldn't do it, and so that made it even more exciting.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.160
But he was right -- I couldn't do the tail.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.160
I started to get the head OK, but the tail I couldn't do.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
It was pretty hard.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
The thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
And I put them together, and you walk between them.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
It was a dialog with the context again.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
Now, if you saw a picture of this

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
as it was published in Architectural Record --

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
they didn't show the context, so you would think,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
"God, what a pushy guy this is."

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
looking for this restaurant.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Couldn't find it.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160
So ...

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:05.160
(Laughter)

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.160
As for craft and technology and all those things

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.160
that you've all been talking about, I was thrown for a complete loop.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
This was built in six months.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.160
The way we sent drawings to Japan:

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.160
we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.160
and we used to make foam models, which that thing scanned.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
And when I got there, everything was perfect --

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.160
except the tail.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.160
So, I decided to cut off the head and the tail.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.160
And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160
And it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made, I think.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
And then Jay Chiat, a friend and client,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.160
asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:07.160
For reasons we don't want to talk about, it got delayed.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.160
Toxic waste, I guess, is the key clue to that one.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.160
And so we built a temporary building -- I'm getting good at temporary --

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
and we put a conference room in that's a fish.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.160
And, finally, Jay dragged me to my hometown, Toronto, Canada.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.160
And there is a story -- it's a real story -- about my grandmother

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
buying a carp on Thursday, bringing it home,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
I played with it in the evening.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160
When I went to sleep, the next day it wasn't there.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
And the next night, we had gefilte fish.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
(Laughter)

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:51.160
And so I set up this interior for Jay's offices

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
and I made a pedestal for a sculpture.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.160
And he didn't buy a sculpture, so I made one.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
and I put the fish in.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
It was a joke.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:11.160
(Laughter)

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.160
I play with funny people like [Claes] Oldenburg.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.160
We've been friends for a long time.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.160
And we've started to work on things.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.160
A few years ago, we did a performance piece in Venice, Italy,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:34.160
called "Il Corso del Coltello" -- the Swiss Army knife.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160
And most of the imagery is --

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
(Laughter)

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
Claes', but those two little boys are my sons,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.160
and they were Claes' assistants in the play.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
He was the Swiss Army knife.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.160
He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.160
and I was Frankie P. Toronto.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
P for Palladio.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.160
Dressed up like the AT&amp;T building by Claes --

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.160
(Laughter)

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.160
with a fish hat.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.160
The highlight of the performance was at the end.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.160
This beautiful object, the Swiss Army knife,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.160
which I get credit for participating in.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
And I can tell you -- it's totally an Oldenburg.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.160
I had nothing to do with it.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
The only thing I did was, I made it possible for them

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
because I love sailing.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
(Laughter)

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
We made it into a sailing craft.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.160
I've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.160
I do it because it's a curious thing in the culture,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
when things are made in such great quantities,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
absorbed in such great quantities,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160
and there's so much denial about them.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
People hate it.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.160
And I'm fascinated with that, which, like the paper furniture --

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
it's one of those materials.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
And I'm always drawn to that.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
which nobody will forgive me for.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.160
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
And that chain link is really expensive.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.160
It's in perspective and everything.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160
And then we did a camp together for children with cancer.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.160
And you can see, we started making a building together.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
Of course, the milk can is his.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
But we were trying to collide our ideas,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
to put objects next to each other.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.160
Like a Morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:45.160
And it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.160
Then Jay Chiat asked me to do this building

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:55.160
on this funny lot in Venice, and I started with this three-piece thing,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
and you entered in the middle.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
And he pushed that.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
And one day I had a -- oh, well, the other way.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160
I had the binoculars from Claes, and I put them there,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
and I could never get rid of them after that.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
Oldenburg made the binoculars incredible

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:22.160
when he sent me the first model of the real proposal.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
It made my building look sick.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
And it was this interaction between

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.160
that kind of, up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
It led to the building on the left.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.160
And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars, you know,

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:43.160
leaving out the -- what the hell.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.160
I use a lot of metal in my work,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.160
and I have a hard time connecting with the craft.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
The whole thing about my house,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.160
the whole use of rough carpentry and everything,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
was the frustration with the crafts available.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.160
I said, "If I can't get the craft that I want,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
I'll use the craft I can get."

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
There were plenty of models for that,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.160
in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and many artists

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:20.160
who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.160
I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.160
that was a sculpture.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.160
And it was all of one material,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
The metalworkers, for the most part,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:48.160
for the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.160
and I did it on the condition that they become my partners

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:56.160
in the future and help me with all future metal buildings, etc. etc.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
And it's working very well

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.160
to have these people, these craftsmen, interested in it.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
I just tell the stories.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.160
It's a way of connecting, at least, with some of those people

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.160
that are so important to the realization of architecture.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.160
The metal continued into a building -- Herman Miller, in Sacramento.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.160
And it's just a complex of factory buildings.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.160
And Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place --

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
a people place.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
I mean, it's kind of a trite thing to say,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.160
but it is real that they wanted to have a central place

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.160
where the cafeteria would be, where the people would come

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.160
and where the people working would interact.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.160
So it's out in the middle of nowhere, and you approach it.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.160
It's copper and galvanize.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.160
I used the galvanize and copper

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.160
in a very light gauge, so it would buckle.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.160
I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier's aesthetic.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160
Everybody's trying to get the panels perfect,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.160
and I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.160
And they end up looking like stone.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160
This is the central area.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160
There's a ramp.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160
And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.160
And when I was awarded the contract I, at the very beginning,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.160
asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.160
Because these were ideas that we were talking about,

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.160
building things next to each other, making --

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.160
it's all about [a] metaphor for a city, maybe.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.160
And so Stanley did the little dome thing.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.160
And we did it over the phone and by fax.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.160
He would send me a fax and show me something.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
He'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.160
I told him, "No, no, that's too ongepotchket.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.160
I don't want the tower."

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.160
So he came back with a simpler building,

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:17.160
but he put some funny details on it,

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.160
and he moved it closer to my building.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.160
And so I decided to put him in a depression.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.160
I put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.160
And so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.160
going back and forth over a couple of weeks' period.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.160
And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.160
And so then I put this big billboard behind it.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.160
And I call it, "David and Goliath."

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.160
And that's my cafeteria.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:00.160
In Boston, we had that old building on the left.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.160
It was a very prominent building off the freeway,

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.160
and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.160
and used the kind of -- I thought -- the language of the neighborhood,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.160
which had these cornices, projecting cornices.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:23.160
Mine got a little exuberant, but I used lead copper,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:28.160
which is a beautiful material, and it turns green in 100 years.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.160
Instead of, like, copper in 10 or 15.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.160
We redid the side of the building

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.160
and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.160
And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.160
because they have very strict kind of design guideline,

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:55.160
and they wouldn't normally think I would fit them.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.160
The detailing was very careful with the lead copper

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:04.160
and making panels and fitting it tightly

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.160
into the fabric of the existing building.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:16.160
In Barcelona, on Las Ramblas for some film festival,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.160
I did the Hollywood sign going and coming,

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.160
made a building out of it, and they built it.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.160
I flew in one night and took this picture.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.160
But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:38.160
And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica --

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.160
a little shopping center.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.160
And this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa,

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.160
in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:07.160
It's the support labs, which, by some coincidence, required no windows.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:12.160
And the shape fit perfectly.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.160
I just joined the points.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.160
In the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:23.160
That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon --

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.160
and so it was an opportunity that I seized,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:32.160
because I didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.160
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:44.160
This is a small house somewhere.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.160
They've been building it so long I don't remember where it is.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.160
It's in the West Valley.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.160
And we started with the stream

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.160
and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.160
These are the models.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.160
The reality, with the lake --

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.160
the workmanship is pretty bad.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:16.160
And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.160
When you have to do something really cheaply,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.160
it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:42.160
That big metal thing is a passage, and in it is --

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.160
you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom,

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.160
which is on the right.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.160
It's kind of like a whole built town.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:07.160
I was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.160
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.160
This is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.160
The owners had a dilemma -- they asked Philip to do it.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.160
He was too busy.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.160
He didn't recommend me, by the way.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.160
(Laughter)

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:40.160
We ended up having to make it a sculpture, because the dilemma was,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.160
how do you build a building that doesn't look like the language?

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.160
Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided?

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.160
Etc. etc.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.160
You've got the idea.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.160
And so we finally ended up making it.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.160
These people are art collectors.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.160
And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.160
from the main house and all the windows are on the other side.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.160
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:18.160
It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply --

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.160
it's that formed lumber from Finland.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.160
We used it at Loyola on the chapel, and it didn't work.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.160
I keep trying to make it work.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.160
In this case we learned how to detail it.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:40.160
In Cleveland, there's Burnham Mall, on the left.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.160
It's never been finished.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:47.160
Going out to the lake, you can see all those new buildings we built.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:53.160
And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.160
There's a railroad track.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:00.160
This is the city hall over here somewhere, and the courthouse.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.160
And the centerline of the mall goes out.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.160
Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built,

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.160
and so we followed.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.160
Sohio is on the axis here,

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.160
and we followed the axis, and they're two kind of goalposts.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.160
And this is our building,

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.160
which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.160
We collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top, folded.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.160
The health club is fastened to the garage

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.160
with a C-clamp, for Cleveland.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.160
(Laughter)

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.160
You drive down.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.160
So it's about a 10-story C-clamp.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.160
And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum,

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.160
and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.160
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.160
And this would be a hotel.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.160
So, the centerline of this thing -- we'd preserve it,

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.160
and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.160
by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox, etc., that are underway.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.160
It's hard to do high-rise.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.160
I feel much more comfortable down here.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.160
This is a piece of property in Brentwood.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:37.160
And a long time ago, about '82 or something, after my house --

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.160
I designed a house for myself

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.160
that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard --

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.160
and the owner of this lot worked for me

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.160
and built that actual model on the left.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.160
And she came back,

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.160
I guess wealthier or something -- something happened --

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:04.160
and asked me to design a house for her on this site.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:11.160
And following that basic idea of the village,

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.160
we changed it as we got into it.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:18.160
I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end --

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.160
here you see on the photographs of the site --

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.160
slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:30.160
like a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom,

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.160
which I designed like a kind of a barge,

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.160
looking like a boat.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:42.160
And that's it, built.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.160
The dome was a request from the client.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.160
She wanted a dome somewhere in the house.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.160
She didn't care where.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.160
When you sleep in this bedroom, I hope --

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.160
I mean, I haven't slept in it yet.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.160
I've offered to marry her so I could sleep there,

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:09.160
but she said I didn't have to do that.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.160
But when you're in that room,

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.160
you feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.160
And it's very private.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.160
The landscape is being built around to create a private garden.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:26.160
And then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room,

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.160
and one on the other side.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.160
These aren't focused very well.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.160
I don't know how to do it from here.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.160
Focus the one on the right.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.160
It's up there.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.160
Left -- it's my right.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:53.160
Anyway, you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.160
That's the living room.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.160
Servants' quarters.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.160
A guest bedroom, which has this dome with marble on it.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:06.160
And then you enter into the living room and then so on.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.160
This is the bedroom.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.160
You come down from this level along the stairway,

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.160
and you enter the bedroom here, going into the lake.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.160
And the bed is back in this space,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.160
with windows looking out onto the lake.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:28.160
These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.160
and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:37.160
The material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:46.160
And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land --

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:52.160
it's 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:58.160
and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.160
with a high space in it.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.160
And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.160
with the dining room table.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.160
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.160
But the idea is, the windows are all placed

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.160
so you see pieces of the house outside.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.160
Eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up --

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.160
and it will be very private.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.160
And you feel like you're in your own kind of village.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:42.160
This is for Michael Eisner -- Disney.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.160
We're doing some work for him.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.160
And this is in Anaheim, California, and it's a freeway building.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:54.160
You go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour,

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.160
and there's another bridge here.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.160
And you're through this room in a split second,

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.160
and the building will sort of reflect that.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.160
On the backside, it's much more humane -- entrance,

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.160
dining hall, etc.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:10.160
And then this thing here -- I'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.160
the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.160
Kind of a fun thing to do.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.160
I'm doing a building in Switzerland, Basel,

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.160
which is an office building for a furniture company.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.160
And we struggled with the image.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.160
These are the early studies, but they have to sell furniture

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:38.160
to normal people, so if I did the building and it was too fancy,

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.160
then people might say, "Well, the furniture looks OK in his thing,

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.160
but no, it ain't going to look good in my normal building."

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.160
So we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here,

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:52.160
and we've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.160
so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.160
And you're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.160
interaction between these pieces.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.160
This is in Paris, along the Seine.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.160
Palais des Sports, the Gare de Lyon over here.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.160
The Minister of Finance -- the guy that moved from the Louvre -- goes in here.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.160
There's a new library across the river.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:23.160
And back in here, in this already treed park,

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.160
we're doing a very dense building called the American Center,

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:34.160
which has a theater, apartments, dance school, an art museum,

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.160
restaurants and all kinds of -- it's a very dense program --

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.160
bookstores, etc.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.160
In a very tight, small --

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.160
this is the ground level.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.160
And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.160
by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.160
They call it the plan coupe.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:32:01.160
And I struggled with that thing --

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.160
how to get around the corner.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.160
These are the models for it.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.160
I showed you the other model, the one --

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.160
this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing --

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:23.160
so I understood the problem.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.160
I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it?

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.160
Apartments, etc.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.160
And these are the kind of study models we did.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.160
And the one on the left is pretty awful.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.160
You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:48.160
But out of it came finally this resolution, where the elevator piece

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.160
worked frontally to this, parallel to this street,

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.160
and also parallel to here.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.160
And then this kind of twist, with this balcony and the skirt,

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:03.160
kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.160
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater, etc.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.160
So it would all be built in stone, in French limestone,

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.160
except for this metal piece.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.160
And it faces into a park.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:20.160
And the idea was to make this express the energy of this.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:27.160
On the side facing the street it's much more normal,

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:33.160
except I slipped a few mansards down, so that coming on the point,

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.160
these housing units made a gesture to the corner.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:51.160
And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.160
If any of you guys have any ideas for it, please contact me.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.160
I don't know what to do.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.160
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment, and he hired me

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.160
to do a house for him in the Hamptons.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.160
And it's got a fish.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.160
And I keep thinking, "This is going to be the last fish."

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.160
It's like a drug addict.

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.160
I say, "I'm not going to do it anymore -- I don't want to do it anymore --

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.160
I'm not going to do it."

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.160
And then I do it.

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.160
(Laughter)

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.160
There it is.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.160
But it's the living room.

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.160
And this piece here is --

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.160
I don't know what it is.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.160
I just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.160
so we could take something out.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:37.160
(Applause)

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:41.160
This is Euro Disney, and I've worked with all of the guys

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.160
that presented to you earlier.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.160
We've had a lot of fun working together.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.160
I think I'm from Mars for them, and they are for me,

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.160
but somehow we all manage to work together,

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.160
and I think, productively.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.160
So far.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.160
This is a shopping thing.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.160
You come into the Magic Kingdom

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.160
and the hotel that Tony Baxter's group is doing out here.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.160
And then this is a kind of a shopping mall,

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.160
with a rodeo and restaurants.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.160
And another restaurant.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:23.160
What I did -- because of the Paris skies being quite dull,

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.160
I made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station,

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.160
to the route of the train.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.160
It looks like it's kind of been there,

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.160
and then crashed all these simpler forms into it.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:41.160
The light grid will have a light, be lit up at night and give a

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.160
kind of light ceiling.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.160
In Switzerland -- Germany, actually -- on the Rhine across from Basel,

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.160
we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.160
And I tried to -- there's a Nick Grimshaw building over here,

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.160
there's an Oldenburg sculpture over here --

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.160
I tried to make a relationship urbanistically.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.160
And I don't gave good slides to show -- it's just been completed --

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.160
but this piece here is this building, and these pieces here and here.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:22.160
And as you pass by it's always part -- you see it as all of these pieces

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.160
accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.160
It's plaster and just zinc.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.160
And you wonder, if this is a museum,

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.160
what it's going to be like inside?

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:44.160
If it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything,

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.160
and just wait.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:51.160
I'm so cunning and clever -- I made it quiet and wonderful.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:56.160
But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:04.160
It's actually basically three square rooms

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.160
with a couple of skylights and stuff.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.160
And from the building in the back, you see it as

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.160
an iceberg floating by in the hills.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.160
I know I'm over time.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.160
See, that skylight goes down and becomes that one.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.160
So it's pretty quiet inside.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:47.160
This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:51.160
It's a complicated project.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.160
It has a chamber hall.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.160
It's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.160
with a lot of love and tears and caring.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.160
And it's not a great building, but I approached it optimistically,

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:12.160
that we would make a compositional relationship between us

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.160
that would strengthen both of us.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.160
And the plan of this -- it's a concert hall.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.160
This is the foyer, which is kind of a garden structure.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.160
There's commercial at the ground floor.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.160
These are offices, which, really, in the competition,

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.160
we didn't have to design.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.160
But finally, there's a hotel there.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.160
These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler,

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:42.160
composing these elevations together and relating them

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:47.160
to the buildings that existed -- to MOCA, etc.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:56.160
The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria,

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.160
which led to this compartmentalized scheme,

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.160
which we found out after the competition would not work at all.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:09.160
But everybody liked these forms and liked the space,

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.160
and so that's one of the problems of a competition.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:17.160
You have to then try and get that back in some way.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.160
And we studied many models.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.160
This was our original model.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.160
These were the three buildings that were the ideal --

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.160
the Concertgebouw, Boston and Berlin.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.160
Everybody liked the surround.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.160
Actually, this is the smallest hall in size,

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.160
and it has more seats than any of these

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.160
because it has double balconies.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.160
Our client doesn't want balconies, so --

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.160
and when we met our new acoustician, he told us

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.160
this was the right shape or this was the right shape.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.160
And we tried many shapes, trying to get the energy

00:39:53.160 --> 00:40:01.160
of the original design within an acoustical, acceptable format.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.160
We finally settled on a shape that was

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.160
the proportion of the Concertgebouw

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:11.160
with the sloping outside walls, which the acoustician said

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.160
were crucial to this and later decided they weren't,

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.160
but now we have them.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.160
(Laughter)

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:23.160
And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:29.160
and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.160
That's the idea.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:37.160
And the corners would have skylights

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.160
and these columns would be structural.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.160
And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.160
kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit,

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.160
and create intimacy.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:54.160
Now, this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being --

00:40:54.160 --> 00:41:00.160
and so I wouldn't take it literally, except the feeling of the space.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:05.160
We studied the acoustics with laser stuff,

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.160
and they bounce them off this and see where it all works.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.160
But you get the sense of the hall in section.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:16.160
Most halls come straight down into a proscenium.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.160
In this case we're opening it back up

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.160
and getting skylights in the four corners.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.160
And so it will be quite a different shape.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.160
(Laughter)

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:35.160
The original building, because it was frog-like,

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.160
fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.160
When you get into a box, it's harder to do it -- and here we are,

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.160
struggling with how to put the hotel in.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.160
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.160
I just stuck it on there.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:54.160
But this is how I do work. I do take pieces and bits and look at it

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.160
and struggle with it and cut it away.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.160
And of course it's not going to look like that,

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:03.160
but it is the crazy way I tend to work.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.160
And then finally, in L.A. I was asked to do a sculpture

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:12.160
at the foot of Interstate Bank Tower, the highest building in L.A.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.160
Larry Halprin is doing the stairs.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:19.160
And I was asked to do a fish, and so I did a snake.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.160
(Laughter)

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.160
It's a public space, and I made it kind of a garden structure,

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.160
and you can go in it.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.160
It's a kiva, and Larry's putting some water in there,

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.160
and it works much better than a fish.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:36.160
In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish, and we're working on that,

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.160
at the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done by

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.160
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.160
And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel,

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.160
non-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:54.160
And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it,

00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:02.160
perverted it, into the form of the fish, and created a kind of

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:07.160
a 19th-century contraption that looks like, that will sit --

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.160
this is the beach and the harbor out in front,

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:13.160
and this is really a shopping center with department stores.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.160
And we split these bridges.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.160
Originally, this was all solid with a hole in it.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:22.160
We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.160
a foreground for this hotel.

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.160
We showed this to the hotel people the other day,

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.160
and they were terrified and said that nobody would come

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:37.160
to the Ritz-Carlton anymore, because of this fish.

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.160
(Laughter)

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.160
And finally, I just threw these in -- Lou Danziger.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.160
I didn't expect Lou Danziger to be here,

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.160
but this is a building I did for him in 1964, I think.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.160
A little studio -- and it's sadly for sale.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.160
Time goes on.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:07.160
And this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.160
He designed the robot as the cashier, and the head moves,

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.160
and I did the rest of it.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.160
And the food wasn't as good as the stuff, and so it failed.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.160
It should have been the other way around --

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.160
the food should have been good first.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.160
It didn't work.

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.160
Thank you very much.
