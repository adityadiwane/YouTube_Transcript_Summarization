00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.156
I'm going to speak to you
about the global refugee crisis

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.996
and my aim is to show you that this crisis

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.620
is manageable, not unsolvable,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.076
but also show you that this is
as much about us and who we are

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.340
as it is a trial of the refugees
on the front line.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.956
For me, this is not
just a professional obligation,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.916
because I run an NGO supporting refugees
and displaced people around the world.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.140
It's personal.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.940
I love this picture.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.836
That really handsome guy on the right,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.060
that's not me.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.156
That's my dad, Ralph, in London, in 1940

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.980
with his father Samuel.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.236
They were Jewish refugees from Belgium.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.580
They fled the day the Nazis invaded.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.854
And I love this picture, too.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.620
It's a group of refugee children

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.980
arriving in England in 1946 from Poland.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.900
And in the middle is my mother, Marion.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.476
She was sent to start a new life

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.996
in a new country

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.276
on her own

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.740
at the age of 12.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.356
I know this:

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.636
if Britain had not admitted refugees

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.860
in the 1940s,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.700
I certainly would not be here today.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.180
Yet 70 years on,
the wheel has come full circle.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.676
The sound is of walls being built,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.196
vengeful political rhetoric,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.900
humanitarian values and principles on fire

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.476
in the very countries
that 70 years ago said never again

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.140
to statelessness and hopelessness
for the victims of war.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.100
Last year, every minute,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.476
24 more people were displaced
from their homes

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.020
by conflict, violence and persecution:

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.676
another chemical weapon attack in Syria,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.156
the Taliban on the rampage in Afghanistan,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.459
girls driven from their school
in northeast Nigeria by Boko Haram.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.116
These are not people
moving to another country

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.380
to get a better life.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.780
They're fleeing for their lives.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.100
It's a real tragedy

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.500
that the world's most famous refugee
can't come to speak to you here today.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.780
Many of you will know this picture.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.236
It shows the lifeless body

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.356
of five-year-old Alan Kurdi,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.836
a Syrian refugee who died
in the Mediterranean in 2015.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.260
He died alongside 3,700 others
trying to get to Europe.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.820
The next year, 2016,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.900
5,000 people died.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.860
It's too late for them,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.796
but it's not too late
for millions of others.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.868
It's not too late
for people like Frederick.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.956
I met him in the Nyarugusu
refugee camp in Tanzania.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.180
He's from Burundi.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.116
He wanted to know
where could he complete his studies.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.236
He'd done 11 years of schooling.
He wanted a 12th year.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.876
He said to me, "I pray
that my days do not end here

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.100
in this refugee camp."

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.300
And it's not too late for Halud.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.996
Her parents were Palestinian refugees

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.820
living in the Yarmouk refugee camp
outside Damascus.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.826
She was born to refugee parents,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.620
and now she's a refugee
herself in Lebanon.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.980
She's working for the International
Rescue Committee to help other refugees,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.636
but she has no certainty at all

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.796
about her future,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.500
where it is or what it holds.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.116
This talk is about Frederick, about Halud

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.540
and about millions like them:

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.076
why they're displaced,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.540
how they survive, what help they need
and what our responsibilities are.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.060
I truly believe this,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.820
that the biggest question
in the 21st century

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.620
concerns our duty to strangers.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.396
The future "you" is about your duties

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.620
to strangers.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.636
You know better than anyone,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.460
the world is more connected
than ever before,

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:30.236
yet the great danger

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.779
is that we're consumed by our divisions.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.076
And there is no better test of that

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.060
than how we treat refugees.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.596
Here are the facts: 65 million people

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.836
displaced from their homes
by violence and persecution last year.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.596
If it was a country,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.900
that would be the 21st
largest country in the world.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.596
Most of those people, about 40 million,
stay within their own home country,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.196
but 25 million are refugees.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.220
That means they cross a border
into a neighboring state.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.956
Most of them are living in poor countries,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.996
relatively poor or lower-middle-income
countries, like Lebanon,

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.300
where Halud is living.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.660
In Lebanon, one
in four people is a refugee,

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.636
a quarter of the whole population.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.756
And refugees stay for a long time.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.876
The average length of displacement

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.100
is 10 years.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.500
I went to what was the world's
largest refugee camp, in eastern Kenya.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.116
It's called Dadaab.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.276
It was built in 1991-92

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.220
as a "temporary camp"
for Somalis fleeing the civil war.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.940
I met Silo.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.356
And naÃ¯vely I said to Silo,

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.580
"Do you think you'll ever
go home to Somalia?"

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.660
And she said, "What do you mean, go home?

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.340
I was born here."

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.636
And then when I asked the camp management

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.716
how many of the 330,000 people
in that camp were born there,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.940
they gave me the answer:

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.500
100,000.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.060
That's what long-term displacement means.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.716
Now, the causes of this are deep:

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.979
weak states that can't
support their own people,

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.076
an international political system

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.380
weaker than at any time since 1945

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.236
and differences over theology, governance,
engagement with the outside world

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.420
in significant parts of the Muslim world.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.676
Now, those are long-term,
generational challenges.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.180
That's why I say that this refugee crisis
is a trend and not a blip.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.716
And it's complex, and when you have
big, large, long-term, complex problems,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.620
people think nothing can be done.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.060
When Pope Francis went to Lampedusa,

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.756
off the coast of Italy, in 2014,

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.076
he accused all of us
and the global population

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.540
of what he called
"the globalization of indifference."

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.796
It's a haunting phrase.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.260
It means that our hearts
have turned to stone.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.196
Now, I don't know, you tell me.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.100
Are you allowed to argue with the Pope,
even at a TED conference?

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.116
But I think it's not right.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.236
I think people do want
to make a difference,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.956
but they just don't know whether
there are any solutions to this crisis.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.796
And what I want to tell you today

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.928
is that though the problems are real,
the solutions are real, too.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.956
Solution one:

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.556
these refugees need to get into work
in the countries where they're living,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.836
and the countries where they're living
need massive economic support.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.740
In Uganda in 2014, they did a study:

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.396
80 percent of refugees
in the capital city Kampala

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.156
needed no humanitarian aid
because they were working.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.609
They were supported into work.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.996
Solution number two:

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.076
education for kids
is a lifeline, not a luxury,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.740
when you're displaced for so long.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.396
Kids can bounce back when they're given
the proper social, emotional support

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.156
alongside literacy and numeracy.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.380
I've seen it for myself.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.836
But half of the world's refugee children
of primary school age

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.836
get no education at all,

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.236
and three-quarters of secondary school age
get no education at all.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.460
That's crazy.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.076
Solution number three:

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.556
most refugees are in urban areas,
in cities, not in camps.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.236
What would you or I want
if we were a refugee in a city?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
We would want money
to pay rent or buy clothes.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.596
That is the future
of the humanitarian system,

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.996
or a significant part of it:

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.676
give people cash so that
you boost the power of refugees

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.676
and you'll help the local economy.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.676
And there's a fourth solution, too,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.436
that's controversial
but needs to be talked about.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.956
The most vulnerable refugees
need to be given a new start

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.060
and a new life in a new country,

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.140
including in the West.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.460
The numbers are relatively small,
hundreds of thousands, not millions,

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.820
but the symbolism is huge.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.396
Now is not the time
to be banning refugees,

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.236
as the Trump administration proposes.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.460
It's a time to be embracing people
who are victims of terror.

00:08:55.979 --> 00:08:57.196
And remember --

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.780
(Applause)

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.036
Remember, anyone who asks you,
"Are they properly vetted?"

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.260
that's a really sensible
and good question to ask.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.236
The truth is, refugees
arriving for resettlement

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.916
are more vetted than any other population
arriving in our countries.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.076
So while it's reasonable
to ask the question,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.980
it's not reasonable to say that refugee
is another word for terrorist.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.156
Now, what happens --

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.556
(Applause)

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.716
What happens when refugees can't get work,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.596
they can't get their kids into school,

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.676
they can't get cash,
they can't get a legal route to hope?

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.780
What happens is they take risky journeys.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.996
I went to Lesbos, this beautiful
Greek island, two years ago.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.876
It's a home to 90,000 people.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.380
In one year, 500,000 refugees
went across the island.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.876
And I want to show you what I saw

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.236
when I drove across
to the north of the island:

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.740
a pile of life jackets
of those who had made it to shore.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.236
And when I looked closer,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.716
there were small
life jackets for children,

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.116
yellow ones.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.380
And I took this picture.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.436
You probably can't see the writing,
but I want to read it for you.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.530
"Warning: will not
protect against drowning."

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.300
So in the 21st century,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.516
children are being given life jackets

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.676
to reach safety in Europe

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.036
even though those jackets
will not save their lives

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.660
if they fall out of the boat
that is taking them there.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.020
This is not just a crisis, it's a test.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.500
It's a test that civilizations
have faced down the ages.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.940
It's a test of our humanity.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.116
It's a test of us in the Western world

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.340
of who we are and what we stand for.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.620
It's a test of our character,
not just our policies.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.956
And refugees are a hard case.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.300
They do come from faraway
parts of the world.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.420
They have been through trauma.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.996
They're often of a different religion.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.196
Those are precisely the reasons
we should be helping refugees,

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.660
not a reason not to help them.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.420
And it's a reason to help them
because of what it says about us.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.140
It's revealing of our values.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.900
Empathy and altruism are two
of the foundations of civilization.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.556
Turn that empathy and altruism into action

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.820
and we live out a basic moral credo.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.036
And in the modern world,
we have no excuse.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.156
We can't say we don't know
what's happening in Juba, South Sudan,

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.756
or Aleppo, Syria.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.676
It's there, in our smartphone

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.076
in our hand.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.676
Ignorance is no excuse at all.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.100
Fail to help, and we show
we have no moral compass at all.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.980
It's also revealing about
whether we know our own history.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.276
The reason that refugees
have rights around the world

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.076
is because of extraordinary
Western leadership

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.436
by statesmen and women
after the Second World War

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.420
that became universal rights.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.100
Trash the protections of refugees,
and we trash our own history.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.436
This is --

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.156
(Applause)

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.196
This is also revealing
about the power of democracy

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.476
as a refuge from dictatorship.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.700
How many politicians have you heard say,

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.900
"We believe in the power of our example,
not the example of our power."

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.100
What they mean is what we stand for
is more important than the bombs we drop.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.980
Refugees seeking sanctuary

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.460
have seen the West as a source
of hope and a place of haven.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.460
Russians, Iranians,

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.596
Chinese, Eritreans, Cubans,

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.220
they've come to the West for safety.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.980
We throw that away at our peril.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.196
And there's one other thing
it reveals about us:

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.554
whether we have any humility
for our own mistakes.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.996
I'm not one of these people

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.356
who believes that all the problems
in the world are caused by the West.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.596
They're not.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.980
But when we make mistakes,
we should recognize it.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.196
It's not an accident
that the country which has taken

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.476
more refugees than any other,
the United States,

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.780
has taken more refugees from Vietnam
than any other country.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.980
It speaks to the history.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.700
But there's more recent history,
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.116
You can't make up
for foreign policy errors

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.716
by humanitarian action,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.636
but when you break something,
you have a duty to try to help repair it,

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.940
and that's our duty now.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.476
Do you remember
at the beginning of the talk,

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.996
I said I wanted to explain
that the refugee crisis

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.660
was manageable, not insoluble?

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.476
That's true. I want you
to think in a new way,

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.220
but I also want you to do things.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.676
If you're an employer,

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.900
hire refugees.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.076
If you're persuaded by the arguments,

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.596
take on the myths

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.860
when family or friends
or workmates repeat them.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.516
If you've got money, give it to charities

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.316
that make a difference
for refugees around the world.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.540
If you're a citizen,

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.196
vote for politicians

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.836
who will put into practice
the solutions that I've talked about.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.076
(Applause)

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.276
The duty to strangers

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.276
shows itself

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.836
in small ways and big,

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.580
prosaic and heroic.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.020
In 1942,

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.796
my aunt and my grandmother
were living in Brussels

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.100
under German occupation.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.420
They received a summons

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.020
from the Nazi authorities
to go to Brussels Railway Station.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.180
My grandmother immediately thought
something was amiss.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.036
She pleaded with her relatives

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.180
not to go to Brussels Railway Station.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.620
Her relatives said to her,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.036
"If we don't go,
if we don't do what we're told,

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.727
then we're going to be in trouble."

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.516
You can guess what happened

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.064
to the relatives who went
to Brussels Railway Station.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.266
They were never seen again.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.620
But my grandmother and my aunt,

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.076
they went to a small village

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.460
south of Brussels

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.076
where they'd been on holiday
in the decade before,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.756
and they presented themselves
at the house of the local farmer,

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.860
a Catholic farmer called Monsieur Maurice,

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.700
and they asked him to take them in.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.356
And he did,

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.100
and by the end of the war,

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.340
17 Jews, I was told,
were living in that village.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.156
And when I was teenager, I asked my aunt,

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.220
"Can you take me to meet
Monsieur Maurice?"

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.436
And she said, "Yeah, I can.
He's still alive. Let's go and see him."

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.260
And so, it must have been '83, '84,

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.516
we went to see him.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.356
And I suppose, like only a teenager could,

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.636
when I met him,

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.116
he was this white-haired gentleman,

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.340
I said to him,

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.180
"Why did you do it?

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.980
Why did you take that risk?"

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.796
And he looked at me and he shrugged,

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.340
and he said, in French,

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.396
"On doit."

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.620
"One must."

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.340
It was innate in him.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.196
It was natural.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.436
And my point to you is it should be
natural and innate in us, too.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.660
Tell yourself,

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.396
this refugee crisis is manageable,

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.996
not unsolvable,

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.340
and each one of us

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.036
has a personal responsibility
to help make it so.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.236
Because this is about the rescue
of us and our values

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.116
as well as the rescue
of refugees and their lives.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.436
Thank you very much indeed.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.580
(Applause)

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.796
Bruno Giussani: David, thank you.
David Miliband: Thank you.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.396
BG: Those are strong suggestions

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.596
and your call for individual
responsibility is very strong as well,

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.836
but I'm troubled
by one thought, and it's this:

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.876
you mentioned, and these are your words,
"extraordinary Western leadership"

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.756
which led 60-something years ago

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.836
to the whole discussion
about human rights,

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.580
to the conventions on refugees, etc. etc.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.436
That leadership
happened after a big trauma

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.436
and happened in
a consensual political space,

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.596
and now we are
in a divisive political space.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.356
Actually, refugees have become
one of the divisive issues.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.340
So where will leadership come from today?

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.436
DM: Well, I think that you're right to say

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.860
that the leadership forged in war

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.836
has a different temper
and a different tempo

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.116
and a different outlook

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.820
than leadership forged in peace.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.116
And so my answer would be
the leadership has got to come from below,

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.596
not from above.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.956
I mean, a recurring theme
of the conference this week

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.796
has been about
the democratization of power.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.996
And we've got to preserve
our own democracies,

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.516
but we've got to also activate
our own democracies.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.356
And when people say to me,

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.236
"There's a backlash against refugees,"

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.516
what I say to them is,

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.636
"No, there's a polarization,

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.876
and at the moment,

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.900
those who are fearful
are making more noise

00:18:12.924 --> 00:18:14.436
than those who are proud."

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.436
And so my answer to your question
is that we will sponsor and encourage

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.236
and give confidence to leadership

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.036
when we mobilize ourselves.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.356
And I think that when you are
in a position of looking for leadership,

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.716
you have to look inside

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.436
and mobilize in your own community

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.676
to try to create conditions
for a different kind of settlement.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.916
BG: Thank you, David.
Thanks for coming to TED.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.340
(Applause)
