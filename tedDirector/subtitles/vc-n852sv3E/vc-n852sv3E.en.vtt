00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:15.070
I want to talk about sex for money.

00:00:15.413 --> 00:00:18.183
I'm not like most of the people
you'll have heard speaking

00:00:18.207 --> 00:00:19.515
about prostitution before.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.599
I'm not a police officer
or a social worker.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.837
I'm not an academic,
a journalist or a politician.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.077
And as you'll probably have
picked up from Maryam's blurb,

00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:30.302
I'm not a nun, either.

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:31.415
(Laughter)

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.407
Most of those people would tell you
that selling sex is degrading;

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:37.566
that no one would ever choose to do it;

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.444
that it's dangerous;
women get abused and killed.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.966
In fact, most of those people would say,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.778
"There should be a law against it!"

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:46.965
Maybe that sounds reasonable to you.

00:00:47.896 --> 00:00:51.808
It sounded reasonable to me
until the closing months of 2009,

00:00:51.832 --> 00:00:55.013
when I was working two dead-end,
minimum-wage jobs.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.048
Every month my wages would just
replenish my overdraft.

00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:01.627
I was exhausted and my life
was going nowhere.

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:04.033
Like many others before me,

00:01:04.057 --> 00:01:06.450
I decided sex for money
was a better option.

00:01:07.203 --> 00:01:08.441
Now don't get me wrong --

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:10.872
I would have loved
to have won the lottery instead.

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:12.991
But it wasn't going
to happen anytime soon,

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:14.425
and my rent needed paying.

00:01:14.832 --> 00:01:17.353
So I signed up for my first
shift in a brothel.

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:20.020
In the years that have passed,

00:01:20.044 --> 00:01:21.878
I've had a lot of time to think.

00:01:22.296 --> 00:01:25.917
I've reconsidered the ideas
I once had about prostitution.

00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:27.846
I've given a lot of thought to consent

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.099
and the nature of work under capitalism.

00:01:30.552 --> 00:01:32.338
I've thought about gender inequality

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:34.878
and the sexual and reproductive
labor of women.

00:01:35.497 --> 00:01:38.684
I've experienced exploitation
and violence at work.

00:01:39.142 --> 00:01:40.717
I've thought about what's needed

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:42.971
to protect other sex workers
from these things.

00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:45.104
Maybe you've thought about them, too.

00:01:45.128 --> 00:01:46.285
In this talk,

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:48.778
I'll take you through
the four main legal approaches

00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:50.786
applied to sex work throughout the world,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.373
and explain why they don't work;

00:01:52.397 --> 00:01:55.555
why prohibiting the sex industry
actually exacerbates every harm

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.489
that sex workers are vulnerable to.

00:01:58.122 --> 00:02:02.478
Then I'm going tell you about what we,
as sex workers, actually want.

00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:06.541
The first approach
is full criminalization.

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.076
Half the world,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.594
including Russia, South Africa
and most of the US,

00:02:10.618 --> 00:02:13.545
regulates sex work by criminalizing
everyone involved.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.697
So that's seller, buyer and third parties.

00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:18.806
Lawmakers in these countries
apparently hope

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.702
that the fear of getting arrested
will deter people from selling sex.

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:25.278
But if you're forced to choose
between obeying the law

00:02:25.302 --> 00:02:27.286
and feeding yourself or your family,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.087
you're going to do the work anyway,

00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:30.546
and take the risk.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.487
Criminalization is a trap.

00:02:32.938 --> 00:02:36.585
It's hard to get a conventional job
when you have a criminal record.

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.605
Potential employers won't hire you.

00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:40.425
Assuming you still need money,

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.240
you'll stay in the more flexible,
informal economy.

00:02:43.264 --> 00:02:45.776
The law forces you to keep selling sex,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.751
which is the exact opposite
of its intended effect.

00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:53.544
Being criminalized leaves you exposed
to mistreatment by the state itself.

00:02:53.568 --> 00:02:56.333
In many places you may be coerced
into paying a bribe

00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:58.712
or even into having sex
with a police officer

00:02:58.736 --> 00:02:59.925
to avoid arrest.

00:03:00.432 --> 00:03:03.360
Police and prison guards
in Cambodia, for example,

00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:05.408
have been documented
subjecting sex workers

00:03:05.432 --> 00:03:07.721
to what can only be described as torture:

00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:08.896
threats at gunpoint,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.712
beatings, electric shocks, rape

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:13.176
and denial of food.

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:15.313
Another worrying thing:

00:03:15.337 --> 00:03:19.736
if you're selling sex in places
like Kenya, South Africa or New York,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.456
a police officer can arrest you
if you're caught carrying condoms,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.482
because condoms can legally be used
as evidence that you're selling sex.

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:29.948
Obviously, this increases HIV risk.

00:03:29.972 --> 00:03:32.432
Imagine knowing if you're busted
carrying condoms,

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:34.310
it'll be used against you.

00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:37.336
It's a pretty strong incentive
to leave them at home, right?

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.666
Sex workers working in these places
are forced to make a tough choice

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.451
between risking arrest
or having risky sex.

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:45.364
What would you choose?

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.928
Would you pack condoms to go to work?

00:03:48.447 --> 00:03:49.749
How about if you're worried

00:03:49.773 --> 00:03:52.738
the police officer would rape you
when he got you in the van?

00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:56.808
The second approach to regulating
sex work seen in these countries

00:03:56.832 --> 00:03:58.224
is partial criminalization,

00:03:58.248 --> 00:04:00.800
where the buying and selling
of sex are legal,

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.119
but surrounding activities,

00:04:02.143 --> 00:04:05.355
like brothel-keeping or soliciting
on the street, are banned.

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:07.022
Laws like these --

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.935
we have them in the UK and in France --

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.617
essentially say to us sex workers,

00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:12.459
"Hey, we don't mind you selling sex,

00:04:12.483 --> 00:04:14.570
just make sure it's done
behind closed doors

00:04:14.594 --> 00:04:16.081
and all alone."

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:17.890
And brothel-keeping, by the way,

00:04:17.914 --> 00:04:20.953
is defined as just two or more
sex workers working together.

00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:23.810
Making that illegal means
that many of us work alone,

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:26.657
which obviously makes us
vulnerable to violent offenders.

00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:27.911
But we're also vulnerable

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.598
if we choose to break the law
by working together.

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:32.579
A couple of years ago,

00:04:32.603 --> 00:04:35.472
a friend of mine was nervous
after she was attacked at work,

00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:39.185
so I said that she could see her clients
from my place for a while.

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:40.431
During that time,

00:04:40.455 --> 00:04:42.387
we had another guy turn nasty.

00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:45.139
I told the guy to leave
or I'd call the police.

00:04:45.163 --> 00:04:47.754
And he looked at the two of us and said,

00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:49.888
"You girls can't call the cops.

00:04:49.912 --> 00:04:52.660
You're working together,
this place is illegal."

00:04:52.684 --> 00:04:53.847
He was right.

00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:56.454
He eventually left
without getting physically violent,

00:04:56.478 --> 00:04:58.702
but the knowledge
that we were breaking the law

00:04:58.726 --> 00:05:00.416
empowered that man to threaten us.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.441
He felt confident he'd get away with it.

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:05.744
The prohibition of street prostitution
also causes more harm

00:05:05.768 --> 00:05:06.920
than it prevents.

00:05:06.944 --> 00:05:08.936
Firstly, to avoid getting arrested,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.223
street workers take risks
to avoid detection,

00:05:11.247 --> 00:05:12.610
and that means working alone

00:05:12.634 --> 00:05:14.669
or in isolated locations like dark forests

00:05:14.693 --> 00:05:16.745
where they're vulnerable to attack.

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:18.666
If you're caught selling sex outdoors,

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.908
you pay a fine.

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:23.152
How do you pay that fine
without going back to the streets?

00:05:23.176 --> 00:05:25.723
It was the need for money
that saw you in the streets

00:05:25.747 --> 00:05:26.898
in the first place.

00:05:26.922 --> 00:05:28.445
And so the fines stack up,

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.207
and you're caught in a vicious cycle

00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:33.591
of selling sex to pay the fines
you got for selling sex.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.892
Let me tell you about Mariana Popa
who worked in Redbridge, East London.

00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:41.443
The street workers on her patch
would normally wait for clients in groups

00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:42.763
for safety in numbers

00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:45.730
and to warn each other about how
to avoid dangerous guys.

00:05:46.142 --> 00:05:49.810
But during a police crackdown
on sex workers and their clients,

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:52.814
she was forced to work alone
to avoid being arrested.

00:05:53.446 --> 00:05:57.488
She was stabbed to death
in the early hours of October 29, 2013.

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.814
She had been working later than usual

00:05:59.838 --> 00:06:02.892
to try to pay off a fine
she had received for soliciting.

00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:06.729
So if criminalizing
sex workers hurts them,

00:06:06.753 --> 00:06:09.539
why not just criminalize
the people who buy sex?

00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:11.692
This is the aim of the third approach

00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:12.874
I want to talk about --

00:06:12.898 --> 00:06:14.986
the Swedish or Nordic
model of sex-work law.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.237
The idea behind this law

00:06:16.261 --> 00:06:18.724
is that selling sex
is intrinsically harmful

00:06:18.748 --> 00:06:22.250
and so you're, in fact, helping
sex workers by removing the option.

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:24.002
Despite growing support

00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:26.708
for what's often described
as the "end demand" approach,

00:06:26.732 --> 00:06:28.375
there's no evidence that it works.

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:31.738
There's just as much prostitution
in Sweden as there was before.

00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:33.178
Why might that be?

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:35.567
It's because people selling sex

00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:37.707
often don't have other options for income.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:38.883
If you need that money,

00:06:38.907 --> 00:06:41.389
the only effect that a drop
in business is going have

00:06:41.413 --> 00:06:43.138
is to force you to lower your prices

00:06:43.162 --> 00:06:45.567
or offer more risky sexual services.

00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:47.164
If you need to find more clients,

00:06:47.188 --> 00:06:48.986
you might seek the help of a manager.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.990
So you see, rather than putting a stop

00:06:51.014 --> 00:06:52.847
to what's often descried as pimping,

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.891
a law like this actually gives oxygen

00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:56.951
to potentially abusive third parties.

00:06:57.606 --> 00:06:59.419
To keep safe in my work,

00:06:59.443 --> 00:07:01.336
I try not to take bookings from someone

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.110
who calls me from a withheld number.

00:07:03.134 --> 00:07:05.059
If it's a home or a hotel visit,

00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:07.252
I try to get a full name and details.

00:07:07.703 --> 00:07:09.830
If I worked under the Swedish model,

00:07:09.854 --> 00:07:12.552
a client would be too scared
to give me that information.

00:07:12.576 --> 00:07:14.014
I might have no other choice

00:07:14.038 --> 00:07:16.989
but to accept a booking
from a man who is untraceable

00:07:17.013 --> 00:07:18.950
if he later turns out to be violent.

00:07:19.832 --> 00:07:21.047
If you need their money,

00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:23.443
you need to protect
your clients from the police.

00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:24.624
If you work outdoors,

00:07:24.648 --> 00:07:27.211
that means working alone
or in isolated locations,

00:07:27.235 --> 00:07:29.450
just as if you were criminalized yourself.

00:07:29.474 --> 00:07:32.060
It might mean getting into cars quicker,

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:34.629
less negotiating time
means snap decisions.

00:07:35.015 --> 00:07:37.643
Is this guy dangerous or just nervous?

00:07:38.142 --> 00:07:39.828
Can you afford to take the risk?

00:07:40.492 --> 00:07:42.138
Can you afford not to?

00:07:43.555 --> 00:07:45.044
Something I'm often hearing is,

00:07:45.068 --> 00:07:46.396
"Prostitution would be fine

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.801
if we made it legal and regulated it."

00:07:48.825 --> 00:07:50.602
We call that approach legalization,

00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:53.422
and it's used by countries
like the Netherlands, Germany

00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:55.038
and Nevada in the US.

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:57.763
But it's not a great
model for human rights.

00:07:57.787 --> 00:07:59.592
And in state-controlled prostitution,

00:07:59.616 --> 00:08:01.179
commercial sex can only happen

00:08:01.203 --> 00:08:03.496
in certain legally-designated
areas or venues,

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.510
and sex workers are made to comply
with special restrictions,

00:08:06.534 --> 00:08:09.297
like registration
and forced health checks.

00:08:10.014 --> 00:08:12.163
Regulation sounds great on paper,

00:08:12.187 --> 00:08:15.467
but politicians deliberately make
regulation around the sex industry

00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:18.158
expensive and difficult to comply with.

00:08:18.182 --> 00:08:22.526
It creates a two-tiered system:
legal and illegal work.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.552
We sometimes call it
"backdoor criminalization."

00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:28.997
Rich, well-connected brothel owners
can comply with the regulations,

00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:31.194
but more marginalized people
find those hoops

00:08:31.218 --> 00:08:33.172
impossible to jump through.

00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:35.166
And even if it's possible in principle,

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.175
getting a license or proper venue
takes time and costs money.

00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:39.678
It's not going to be an option

00:08:39.702 --> 00:08:42.156
for someone who's desperate
and needs money tonight.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.222
They might be a refugee
or fleeing domestic abuse.

00:08:45.246 --> 00:08:46.785
In this two-tiered system,

00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:50.046
the most vulnerable people
are forced to work illegally,

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.086
so they're still exposed to all
the dangers of criminalization

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.546
I mentioned earlier.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.729
So.

00:08:55.753 --> 00:08:57.835
It's looking like all attempts to control

00:08:57.859 --> 00:08:59.541
or prevent sex work from happening

00:08:59.565 --> 00:09:02.296
makes things more dangerous
for people selling sex.

00:09:02.682 --> 00:09:06.108
Fear of law enforcement makes them
work alone in isolated locations,

00:09:06.132 --> 00:09:07.839
and allows clients and even cops

00:09:07.863 --> 00:09:10.632
to get abusive in the knowledge
they'll get away with it.

00:09:10.656 --> 00:09:13.817
Fines and criminal records force
people to keep selling sex,

00:09:13.841 --> 00:09:15.819
rather than enabling them to stop.

00:09:16.325 --> 00:09:19.102
Crackdowns on buyers drive sellers
to take dangerous risks

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:21.463
and into the arms
of potentially abusive managers.

00:09:21.487 --> 00:09:25.254
These laws also reinforce stigma
and hatred against sex workers.

00:09:25.278 --> 00:09:28.627
When France temporarily brought in
the Swedish model two years ago,

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.626
ordinary citizens took it as a cue

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.601
to start carrying out vigilante attacks

00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:34.764
against people working on the street.

00:09:34.788 --> 00:09:36.786
In Sweden, opinion surveys show

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.765
that significantly more people want
sex workers to be arrested now

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.736
than before the law was brought in.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.747
If prohibition is this harmful,

00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:47.953
you might ask, why it so popular?

00:09:48.832 --> 00:09:51.775
Firstly, sex work is and always
has been a survival strategy

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:54.707
for all kinds of unpopular
minority groups:

00:09:54.731 --> 00:09:55.934
people of color,

00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.109
migrants,

00:09:57.133 --> 00:09:58.357
people with disabilities,

00:09:58.381 --> 00:09:59.576
LGBTQ people,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.297
particularly trans women.

00:10:01.924 --> 00:10:04.030
These are the groups most heavily profiled

00:10:04.054 --> 00:10:06.380
and punished through prohibitionist law.

00:10:06.404 --> 00:10:08.380
I don't think this is an accident.

00:10:08.404 --> 00:10:10.243
These laws have political support

00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:12.906
precisely because they target people

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.512
that voters don't want
to see or know about.

00:10:16.688 --> 00:10:19.076
Why else might people support prohibition?

00:10:19.465 --> 00:10:23.122
Well, lots of people have
understandable fears about trafficking.

00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:27.511
Folks think that foreign women
kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery

00:10:27.535 --> 00:10:30.153
can be saved by shutting
a whole industry down.

00:10:30.555 --> 00:10:32.242
So let's talk about trafficking.

00:10:33.156 --> 00:10:36.739
Forced labor does occur
in many industries,

00:10:36.763 --> 00:10:40.342
especially those where the workers
are migrants or otherwise vulnerable,

00:10:40.366 --> 00:10:42.047
and this needs to be addressed.

00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:46.814
But it's best addressed with legislation
targeting those specific abuses,

00:10:46.838 --> 00:10:48.354
not an entire industry.

00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:51.168
When 23 undocumented Chinese migrants

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:54.109
drowned while picking cockles
in Morecambe Bay in 2004,

00:10:54.133 --> 00:10:57.069
there were no calls to outlaw
the entire seafood industry

00:10:57.093 --> 00:10:59.154
to save trafficking victims.

00:10:59.178 --> 00:11:02.533
The solution is clearly to give
workers more legal protections,

00:11:02.557 --> 00:11:04.326
allowing them to resist abuse

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.390
and report it to authorities
without fear of arrest.

00:11:07.414 --> 00:11:09.714
The way the term trafficking
is thrown around

00:11:09.738 --> 00:11:13.959
implies that all undocumented
migration into prostitution is forced.

00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:17.429
In fact, many migrants
have made a decision,

00:11:17.453 --> 00:11:18.707
out of economic need,

00:11:18.731 --> 00:11:21.514
to place themselves into the hands
of people smugglers.

00:11:21.538 --> 00:11:23.320
Many do this with the full knowledge

00:11:23.344 --> 00:11:26.547
that they'll be selling sex
when they reach their destination.

00:11:26.571 --> 00:11:28.324
And yes, it can often be the case

00:11:28.348 --> 00:11:31.593
that these people smugglers
demand exorbitant fees,

00:11:31.617 --> 00:11:34.521
coerce migrants into work
they don't want to do

00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:36.432
and abuse them when they're vulnerable.

00:11:36.456 --> 00:11:37.959
That's true of prostitution,

00:11:37.983 --> 00:11:39.930
but it's also true of agricultural work,

00:11:39.954 --> 00:11:42.105
hospitality work and domestic work.

00:11:42.653 --> 00:11:46.046
Ultimately, nobody wants
to be forced to do any kind of work,

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.571
but that's a risk many migrants
are willing to take,

00:11:48.595 --> 00:11:50.465
because of what they're leaving behind.

00:11:50.489 --> 00:11:52.449
If people were allowed to migrate legally

00:11:52.473 --> 00:11:56.010
they wouldn't have to place their lives
into the hands of people smugglers.

00:11:56.034 --> 00:11:57.185
The problems arise

00:11:57.209 --> 00:11:59.034
from the criminalization of migration,

00:11:59.058 --> 00:12:01.019
just as they do from the criminalization

00:12:01.043 --> 00:12:02.194
of sex work itself.

00:12:02.218 --> 00:12:03.800
This is a lesson of history.

00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:07.470
If you try to prohibit something
that people want or need to do,

00:12:07.494 --> 00:12:11.069
whether that's drinking alcohol
or crossing borders

00:12:11.093 --> 00:12:12.382
or getting an abortion

00:12:12.406 --> 00:12:13.766
or selling sex,

00:12:14.371 --> 00:12:16.371
you create more problems than you solve.

00:12:16.395 --> 00:12:18.184
Prohibition barely makes a difference

00:12:18.208 --> 00:12:20.638
to the amount of people
actually doing those things.

00:12:20.672 --> 00:12:22.143
But it makes a huge difference

00:12:22.177 --> 00:12:25.096
as to whether or not
they're safe when they do them.

00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:27.890
Why else might people support prohibition?

00:12:28.787 --> 00:12:32.153
As a feminist, I know
that the sex industry is a site

00:12:32.177 --> 00:12:35.057
of deeply entrenched social inequality.

00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:38.133
It's a fact that most buyers of sex
are men with money,

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:40.448
and most sellers are women without.

00:12:40.472 --> 00:12:42.772
You can agree with all that -- I do --

00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:46.102
and still think prohibition
is a terrible policy.

00:12:46.783 --> 00:12:48.921
In a better, more equal world,

00:12:48.945 --> 00:12:52.573
maybe there would be far fewer
people selling sex to survive,

00:12:52.597 --> 00:12:56.208
but you can't simply legislate
a better world into existence.

00:12:56.232 --> 00:12:58.718
If someone needs to sell sex
because they're poor

00:12:58.742 --> 00:13:00.184
or because they're homeless

00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:03.350
or because they're undocumented
and they can't find legal work,

00:13:03.374 --> 00:13:06.929
taking away that option
doesn't make them any less poor

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.576
or house them

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.553
or change their immigration status.

00:13:10.577 --> 00:13:13.108
People worry that selling
sex is degrading.

00:13:13.634 --> 00:13:16.313
Ask yourself: is it more degrading
than going hungry

00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:18.853
or seeing your children go hungry?

00:13:19.366 --> 00:13:22.370
There's no call to ban rich people
from hiring nannies

00:13:22.394 --> 00:13:23.647
or getting manicures,

00:13:23.671 --> 00:13:27.297
even though most of the people
doing that labor are poor, migrant women.

00:13:27.321 --> 00:13:31.465
It's the fact of poor migrant women
selling sex specifically

00:13:31.489 --> 00:13:33.794
that has some feminists uncomfortable.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.634
And I can understand

00:13:35.658 --> 00:13:38.383
why the sex industry provokes
strong feelings.

00:13:38.407 --> 00:13:41.430
People have all kinds
of complicated feelings

00:13:41.454 --> 00:13:42.913
when it comes to sex.

00:13:43.546 --> 00:13:46.791
But we can't make policy
on the basis of mere feelings,

00:13:46.815 --> 00:13:48.877
especially not over
the heads of the people

00:13:48.901 --> 00:13:50.639
actually effected by those policies.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:53.282
If we get fixated on
the abolition of sex work,

00:13:53.306 --> 00:13:55.970
we end up worrying more
about a particular manifestation

00:13:55.994 --> 00:13:57.407
of gender inequality,

00:13:57.431 --> 00:13:59.753
rather than about the underlying causes.

00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:02.764
People get really hung up on the question,

00:14:02.788 --> 00:14:05.256
"Well, would you want
your daughter doing it?"

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.790
That's the wrong question.

00:14:07.217 --> 00:14:09.885
Instead, imagine she is doing it.

00:14:10.542 --> 00:14:12.406
How safe is she at work tonight?

00:14:13.155 --> 00:14:14.684
Why isn't she safer?

00:14:16.497 --> 00:14:19.418
So we've looked at full criminalization,

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:22.445
partial criminalization,
the Swedish or Nordic Model

00:14:22.469 --> 00:14:23.659
and legalization,

00:14:23.683 --> 00:14:25.335
and how they all cause harm.

00:14:25.359 --> 00:14:28.311
Something I never hear asked is:

00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:30.509
"What do sex workers want?"

00:14:31.573 --> 00:14:34.241
After all, we're the ones
most affected by these laws.

00:14:35.115 --> 00:14:37.995
New Zealand decriminalized
sex work in 2003.

00:14:38.532 --> 00:14:40.433
It's crucial to remember

00:14:40.457 --> 00:14:43.908
that decriminalization and legalization
are not the same thing.

00:14:43.932 --> 00:14:46.817
Decriminalization means
the removal of laws

00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:48.884
that punitively target the sex industry,

00:14:48.908 --> 00:14:52.330
instead treating sex work
much like any other kind of work.

00:14:52.354 --> 00:14:55.167
In New Zealand, people
can work together for safety,

00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:57.944
and employers of sex workers
are accountable to the state.

00:14:57.968 --> 00:15:00.651
A sex worker can refuse
to see a client at any time,

00:15:00.675 --> 00:15:02.135
for any reason,

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:04.633
and 96 percent of street workers

00:15:04.657 --> 00:15:07.798
report that they feel the law
protects their rights.

00:15:07.822 --> 00:15:09.916
New Zealand hasn't actually
seen an increase

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.051
in the amount of people doing sex work,

00:15:12.075 --> 00:15:14.699
but decriminalizing it
has made it a lot safer.

00:15:15.274 --> 00:15:16.851
But the lesson from New Zealand

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:19.272
isn't just that its particular
legislation is good,

00:15:19.296 --> 00:15:20.447
but that crucially,

00:15:20.471 --> 00:15:22.790
it was written in collaboration
with sex workers;

00:15:22.814 --> 00:15:25.123
namely, the New Zealand
Prostitutes' Collective.

00:15:25.147 --> 00:15:27.476
When it came to making sex work safer,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.689
they were ready to hear it straight
from sex workers themselves.

00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:32.401
Here in the UK,

00:15:32.425 --> 00:15:35.843
I'm part of sex worker-led groups
like the Sex Worker Open University

00:15:35.867 --> 00:15:37.962
and the English Collective of Prostitutes.

00:15:37.986 --> 00:15:39.781
And we form part of a global movement

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:43.265
demanding decriminalization
and self-determination.

00:15:43.653 --> 00:15:46.393
The universal symbol of our movement
is the red umbrella.

00:15:46.417 --> 00:15:49.518
We're supported in our demands
by global bodies like UNAIDS,

00:15:49.542 --> 00:15:51.142
the World Health Organization

00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:52.552
and Amnesty International.

00:15:52.924 --> 00:15:54.762
But we need more allies.

00:15:55.181 --> 00:15:57.517
If you care about gender equality

00:15:57.541 --> 00:16:00.337
or poverty or migration or public health,

00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:02.865
then sex worker rights matter to you.

00:16:03.355 --> 00:16:05.378
Make space for us in your movements.

00:16:05.402 --> 00:16:08.638
That means not only listening
to sex workers when we speak

00:16:08.662 --> 00:16:10.663
but amplifying our voices.

00:16:11.219 --> 00:16:13.340
Resist those who silence us,

00:16:13.364 --> 00:16:16.543
those who say that a prostitute
is either too victimized,

00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:19.213
too damaged to know
what's best for herself,

00:16:19.237 --> 00:16:20.973
or else too privileged

00:16:20.997 --> 00:16:23.185
and too removed from real hardship,

00:16:23.209 --> 00:16:26.589
not representative of the millions
of voiceless victims.

00:16:27.709 --> 00:16:32.512
This distinction between victim
and empowered is imaginary.

00:16:32.536 --> 00:16:34.989
It exists purely to discredit sex workers

00:16:35.013 --> 00:16:36.956
and make it easy to ignore us.

00:16:37.819 --> 00:16:40.011
No doubt many of you work for a living.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.281
Well, sex work is work, too.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.033
Just like you,

00:16:44.057 --> 00:16:45.663
some of us like our jobs,

00:16:45.687 --> 00:16:47.088
some of us hate them.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.413
Ultimately, most of us
have mixed feelings.

00:16:51.238 --> 00:16:53.644
But how we feel about our work

00:16:54.566 --> 00:16:55.740
isn't the point.

00:16:56.484 --> 00:16:59.502
And how others feel
about our work certainly isn't.

00:17:00.373 --> 00:17:03.121
What's important is that we have
the right to work safely

00:17:03.145 --> 00:17:04.453
and on our own terms.

00:17:04.477 --> 00:17:06.352
Sex workers are real people.

00:17:06.823 --> 00:17:09.003
We've had complicated experiences

00:17:09.655 --> 00:17:12.710
and complicated responses
to those experiences.

00:17:13.651 --> 00:17:16.427
But our demands are not complicated.

00:17:16.451 --> 00:17:19.248
You can ask expensive
escorts in New York City,

00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:22.210
brothel workers in Cambodia,
street workers in South Africa

00:17:22.234 --> 00:17:25.353
and every girl on the roster
at my old job in Soho,

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:27.717
and they will all tell you the same thing.

00:17:27.741 --> 00:17:29.982
You can speak to millions of sex workers

00:17:30.006 --> 00:17:32.463
and countless sex work-led organizations.

00:17:32.487 --> 00:17:36.457
We want full decriminalization
and labor rights as workers.

00:17:36.985 --> 00:17:39.301
I'm just one sex worker
on the stage today,

00:17:39.325 --> 00:17:41.895
but I'm bringing a message
from all over the world.

00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:43.087
Thank you.

00:17:43.111 --> 00:17:49.484
(Applause)
