00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This is a picture of Maurice Druon,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the French Academy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
He is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
befitting the role of the French Academy

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
as legislating the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
correct usage in French

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and perpetuating the language.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The French Academy has two main tasks:

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it compiles a dictionary of official French.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
They're now working on their ninth edition,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which they began in 1930, and they've reached the letter P.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
They also legislate on correct usage,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
such as the proper term for what the French call "email,"

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which ought to be "courriel."

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The World Wide Web, the French are told,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
ought to be referred to as

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
"la toile d'araignee mondiale" -- the Global Spider Web --

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
recommendations that the French gaily ignore.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now, this is one model of how language comes to be:

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
namely, it's legislated by an academy.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But anyone who looks at language realizes

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that this is a rather silly conceit,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that language, rather, emerges from human minds interacting from one another.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language --

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
it will already be well out of date.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We see it in the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
constant appearance of slang and jargon,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of the historical change in languages,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in divergence of dialects

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and the formation of new languages.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
so much as a window onto human nature.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In a book that I'm currently working on,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I hope to use language to shed light on

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
a number of aspects of human nature,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
including the cognitive machinery

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
with which humans conceptualize the world

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and the relationship types that govern human interaction.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Let me start off with a technical problem in language

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
that I've worried about for quite some time --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and indulge me

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
in my passion for verbs and how they're used.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The problem is, which verbs go in which constructions?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The verb is the chassis of the sentence.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Let me give you a quick reminder

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
of something that you've long forgotten.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
An intransitive verb, such as "dine," for example,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
can't take a direct object.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
You have to say, "Sam dined," not, "Sam dined the pizza."

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
A transitive verb mandates

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
that there has to be an object there:

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
"Sam devoured the pizza." You can't just say, "Sam devoured."

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
each of which shapes its sentence.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So, a problem in explaining how children learn language,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don't make grammatical errors,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and a problem in programming computers to use language is

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
which verbs go in which constructions.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
For example, the dative construction in English.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You can say, "Give a muffin to a mouse," the prepositional dative.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Or, "Give a mouse a muffin," the double-object dative.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
"Promise anything to her," "Promise her anything," and so on.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Hundreds of verbs can go both ways.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So a tempting generalization for a child,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
for an adult, for a computer

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
is that any verb that can appear in the construction,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
"subject-verb-thing-to-a-recipient"

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
can also be expressed as "subject-verb-recipient-thing."

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
A handy thing to have,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
because language is infinite,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
You've got to extract generalizations

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
so you can produce and understand new sentences.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
This would be an example of how to do that.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Unfortunately, there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
You can say, "Biff drove the car to Chicago,"

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
but not, "Biff drove Chicago the car."

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
You can say, "Sal gave Jason a headache,"

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
but it's a bit odd to say, "Sal gave a headache to Jason."

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The solution is that these constructions, despite initial appearance,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
are not synonymous,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that when you crank up the microscope

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
on human cognition, you see that there's a subtle difference

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
in meaning between them.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So, "give the X to the Y,"

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that construction corresponds to the thought

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
"cause X to go to Y." Whereas "give the Y the X"

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
corresponds to the thought "cause Y to have X."

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Now, many events can be subject to either construal,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
kind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
in which you can either pay attention

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to the particular object,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
in which case the space around it recedes from attention,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
or you can see the faces in the empty space,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
in which case the object recedes out of consciousness.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
How are these construals reflected in language?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Well, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
is expressed as the direct object,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the noun after the verb.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere --

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
where you're doing something to the muffin --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
you say, "Give the muffin to the mouse."

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
When you construe it as "cause the mouse to have something,"

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
you're doing something to the mouse,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and therefore you express it as, "Give the mouse the muffin."

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So which verbs go in which construction --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the problem with which I began --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
or a kind of possession change.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
To give something involves both causing something to go

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and causing someone to have.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
To drive the car only causes something to go,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
because Chicago's not the kind of thing that can possess something.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Only humans can possess things.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
but it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and causing it to go to the other person,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and implanting it in them.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
You may just be loud or obnoxious,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
or some other way causing them to have the headache.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So, that's

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So why should anyone care?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Well, there are a number of interesting conclusions, I think,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
from this and many similar kinds of analyses

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
of hundreds of English verbs.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
First, there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
which we automatically and unconsciously compute

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
every time we produce or utter a sentence, that governs our use of language.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
You can think of this as the language of thought, or "mentalese."

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs --

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
not only in English, but in all other languages --

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
fundamental concepts such as space,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
time, causation and human intention,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
such as, what is the means and what is the ends?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
These are reminiscent of the kinds of categories

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that Immanuel Kant argued

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
are the basic framework for human thought,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and it's interesting that our unconscious use of language

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
seems to reflect these Kantian categories.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Doesn't care about perceptual qualities,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
such as color, texture, weight and speed,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
which virtually never differentiate

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
the use of verbs in different constructions.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
are used not only literally,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
but in a quasi-metaphorical way.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
For example, this construction, the dative,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
is used not only to transfer things,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
as when we say, "She told a story to me"

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
or "told me a story,"

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
"Max taught Spanish to the students" or "taught the students Spanish."

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It's exactly the same construction,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
but no muffins, no mice, nothing moving at all.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
It evokes the container metaphor of communication,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
in which we conceive of ideas as objects,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
sentences as containers,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and communication as a kind of sending.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
As when we say we "gather" our ideas, to "put" them "into" words,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and if our words aren't "empty" or "hollow,"

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
we might get these ideas "across" to a listener,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
who can "unpack" our words to "extract" their "content."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And indeed, this kind of verbiage is not the exception, but the rule.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
It's very hard to find any example of abstract language

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
that is not based on some concrete metaphor.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
For example, you can use the verb "go"

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and the prepositions "to" and "from"

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
in a literal, spatial sense.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
"The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul."

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
You can also say, "Biff went from sick to well."

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
He needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
but it's as if his health is a point in state space

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
that you conceptualize as moving.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Or, "The meeting went from three to four,"

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Likewise, we use "force" to indicate

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
not only physical force,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
as in, "Rose forced the door to open,"

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
but also interpersonal force,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
as in, "Rose forced Sadie to go," not necessarily by manhandling her,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
but by issuing a threat.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Or, "Rose forced herself to go,"

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
as if there were two entities inside Rose's head,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
engaged in a tug of a war.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
of a given event in two different ways,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
such as "cause something to go to someone"

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and "causing someone to have something,"

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I think is a fundamental feature of human thought,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and it's the basis for much human argumentation,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
in which people don't differ so much on the facts

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
as on how they ought to be construed.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Just to give you a few examples:

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
"ending a pregnancy" versus "killing a fetus;"

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
"a ball of cells" versus "an unborn child;"

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
"invading Iraq" versus "liberating Iraq;"

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
"redistributing wealth" versus "confiscating earnings."

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And I think the biggest picture of all

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
would take seriously the fact

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
that so much of our verbiage about abstract events

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
is based on a concrete metaphor

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and see human intelligence itself

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
as consisting of a repertoire of concepts --

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
such as objects, space, time, causation and intention --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
which are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
whose evolution you can well imagine,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and a process of metaphorical abstraction

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
that allows us to bleach these concepts

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
of their original conceptual content --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
space, time and force --

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and apply them to new abstract domains,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
therefore allowing a species that evolved

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
to deal with rocks and tools and animals,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
to conceptualize mathematics, physics, law

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and other abstract domains.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Well, I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature --

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that govern human social interaction,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
again, as reflected in language.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And I'll start out with a puzzle, the puzzle of indirect speech acts.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Now, I'm sure most of you have seen the movie "Fargo."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And you might remember the scene in which

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
is asked to show his driver's license

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and holds his wallet out

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
with a 50-dollar bill extending

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
at a slight angle out of the wallet.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And he says, "I was just thinking

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo,"

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
which everyone, including the audience,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
interprets as a veiled bribe.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
For example, in polite requests,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
if someone says, "If you could pass the guacamole,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that would be awesome,"

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
we know exactly what he means,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
even though that's a rather bizarre

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
concept being expressed.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
(Laughter)

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
"Would you like to come up and see my etchings?"

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I think most people

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
understand the intent behind that.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And likewise, if someone says,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
"Nice store you've got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it" --

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
(Laughter) --

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
we understand that as a veiled threat,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So the puzzle is, why are bribes,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
polite requests, solicitations and threats so often veiled?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
No one's fooled.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Both parties know exactly what the speaker means,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and the speaker knows the listener knows

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
that the speaker knows that the listener knows, etc., etc.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So what's going on?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I think the key idea is that language

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
is a way of negotiating relationships,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and human relationships fall into a number of types.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
There's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
in which relationships can be categorized, more or less,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
into communality, which works on the principle

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
"what's mine is thine, what's thine is mine,"

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
the kind of mindset that operates within a family, for example;

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
dominance, whose principle is "don't mess with me;"

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
reciprocity, "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours;"

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and sexuality, in the immortal words of Cole Porter, "Let's do it."

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Now, relationship types can be negotiated.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Even though there are default situations

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
in which one of these mindsets can be applied,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
they can be stretched and extended.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
For example, communality applies most naturally

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
within family or friends,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
but it can be used to try to transfer

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
the mentality of sharing

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
For example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
sororities, locutions like "the family of man,"

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
you try to get people who are not related

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
to use the relationship type that would ordinarily

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
be appropriate to close kin.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Now, mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
If you went over and you helped yourself

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
to a shrimp off your boss' plate,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
for example, that would be an awkward situation.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Or if a dinner guest after the meal

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
that would be rather awkward as well.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
In less blatant cases,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
there's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
In the workplace, for example,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
there's often a tension over whether an employee

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
can socialize with the boss,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
or refer to him or her

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
on a first-name basis.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
If two friends have a

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
reciprocal transaction, like selling a car,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
it's well known that this can be a source

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
of tension or awkwardness.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
In dating, the transition

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
from friendship to sex

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
can lead to, notoriously, various forms of awkwardness,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and as can sex in the workplace,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
in which we call the conflict between a

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
dominant and a sexual relationship "sexual harassment."

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Well, what does this have to do with language?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Well, language, as a social interaction,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
has to satisfy two conditions.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
You have to convey the actual content --

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
here we get back to the container metaphor.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
You want to express the bribe, the command, the promise,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
the solicitation and so on,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
but you also have to negotiate

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and maintain the kind of relationship

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
you have with the other person.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
The solution, I think, is that we use language at two levels:

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
the literal form signals

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
the safest relationship with the listener,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
whereas the implicated content --

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform --

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
allows the listener to derive the interpretation

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
which is most relevant in context,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
which possibly initiates a changed relationship.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
The simplest example of this is in the polite request.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
If you express your request as a conditional --

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
"if you could open the window, that would be great" --

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
even though the content is an imperative,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
the fact that you're not using the imperative voice

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
On the other hand, you want the damn guacamole.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
By expressing it as an if-then statement,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
you can get the message across

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
without appearing to boss another person around.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And in a more subtle way, I think, this works

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
for all of the veiled speech acts

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
involving plausible deniability:

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
the bribes, threats, propositions,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
solicitations and so on.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
if language -- where it could only be used literally.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And you can think of it in terms of a

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
game-theoretic payoff matrix.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Put yourself in the position of the

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
There's a high stakes

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
in the two possibilities

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
If you don't bribe the officer,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
then you will get a traffic ticket --

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
or, as is the case of "Fargo," worse --

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
whether the honest officer

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
is honest or dishonest.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
In that case, the consequences are rather severe.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
On the other hand, if you extend the bribe,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
if the officer is dishonest,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
you get a huge payoff of going free.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
If the officer is honest, you get a huge penalty

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
of being arrested for bribery.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
So this is a rather fraught situation.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
On the other hand, with indirect language,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
if you issue a veiled bribe,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
then the dishonest officer

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
could interpret it as a bribe,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
in which case you get the payoff of going free.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and therefore, you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So you get the best of both worlds.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And a similar analysis, I think,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
can apply to the potential awkwardness

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
of a sexual solicitation,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I think this affirms

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
something that's long been known by diplomats --

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
namely, that the vagueness of language,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
far from being a bug or an imperfection,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
actually might be a feature of language,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
one that we use to our advantage in social interactions.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
So to sum up: language is a collective human creation,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
reflecting human nature,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
how we conceptualize reality,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
how we relate to one another.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
I think we can get a window onto what makes us tick.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
(Applause)
