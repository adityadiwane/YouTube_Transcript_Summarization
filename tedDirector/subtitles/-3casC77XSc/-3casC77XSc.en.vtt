00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
♫ Like the heather ♫

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
♫ on the hillside ♫

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
♫ as they drove us ♫

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
♫ from the Highlands ♫

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
♫ Like the ice flow ♫

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
♫ from the Arctic ♫

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
♫ where we landed ♫

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
♫ in Newfoundland ♫

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ There's a color ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
♫ to my sorrow ♫

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
♫ There's a name for ♫

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
♫ all this sadness ♫

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
♫ Like the ocean ♫

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
♫ in between us ♫

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
♫ I am blue ♫

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
♫ Blue is a river ♫

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
♫ Blue remembered ♫

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
♫ Blue water ♫

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
♫ running clear ♫

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
♫ Blue like a planet ♫

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
♫ to a spaceman ♫

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
♫ Blue river ♫

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
♫ of my tears ♫

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:29.000
(Fiddle and synthesizer)

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
♫ So I came here ♫

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
♫ to the city ♫

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
♫ where the dream burns ♫

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
♫ like a furnace ♫

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
♫ And I dazzled ♫

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
♫ in these dark streets ♫

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
♫ like a diamond ♫

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
♫ in a coalface ♫

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
♫ Then the cold wind ♫

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
♫ from the islands ♫

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
♫ blew a storm cloud ♫

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
♫ across the new moon ♫

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
♫ Like the gun smoke ♫

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
♫ above the houses ♫

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
♫ in my home ♫

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
♫ Blue is a river ♫

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
♫ Blue remembered ♫

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
♫ Blue water ♫

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
♫ running clear ♫

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
♫ Blue like a planet ♫

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
♫ to a spaceman ♫

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
♫ Blue river ♫

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
♫ of my tears ♫

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
♫ Blue river ♫

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
♫ of my tears ♫

00:04:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
(Fiddle and synthesizer)

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
(Applause)
