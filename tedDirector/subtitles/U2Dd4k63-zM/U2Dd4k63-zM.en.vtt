00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Walk around for four months with three wishes,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and all the ideas will start to percolate up.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I think everybody should do it -- think that you've got three wishes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And what would you do? It's actually a great exercise

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to really drill down to the things that you feel are important,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and really reflect on the world around us.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And thinking that, can an individual actually do something,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
or come up with something,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Inspired by nature -- that's the theme here.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And I think, quite frankly, that's where I started.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and my father was an avid outdoorsman.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So I really had a chance to experience that.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But what I think it was telling me

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is that we are this transient thing that's happening,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the untouched forest that I was able to see --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
really bring in a sense of that geological time,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that this has gone on for a long time,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and we're experiencing it in a different way.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to have

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to be able to make the work that I did.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
along a roadside.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
trying to photograph the pristine landscape.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that it wouldn't catch on out there,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
or something of that nature, and I couldn't get away from it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I decided to rethink the landscape

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
as the landscape that we've transformed.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And I ended up in a town called Frackville.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I got out of the car, and I stood up,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Totally transformed by man.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And that got me to go out and look at mines like this,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
in the landscape that I could find.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And that became the baseline of what I was doing.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and not have to re-invent myself --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
that this theme was large enough to become a life's work,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
to become something that I could sink my teeth into

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and just research and find out where these industries are.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
which I kind of missed,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to get into that place to make those photographs,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and if it wasn't for those people letting me in

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
at the heads of those corporations,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I would have never made this body of work.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I own a corporation. I work with them,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and I feel that we all need them and they're important.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But I am also for sustainability.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
but it is a slow progression.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man:

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
the Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And these ages of man are still at work today.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
But we've become totally disconnected from them.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
There's something that we're not seeing there.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
at the collective appetite for our lifestyles,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and what we're doing to that landscape --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And through my photographs,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Not to say, "Oh my God, what is it?" but to be challenged by it --

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
to say, "Wow, this is beautiful," on one level,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
but on the other level, "This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it."

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Like a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that I think is what resonates out there,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and it gets people to look at these things,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and it gets people to enter it. And it also, in a way, defines kind of what I feel, too --

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that I'm drawn to have a good life.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I want a house, and I want a car.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
But there's this consequence out there.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It's even in my own conscience I'm having it,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and here in my work, I'm trying to build that same toggle.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
These things that I photographed -- this tire pile here

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
had 45 million tires in it. It was the largest one.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me, and it caught fire

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
about four years ago. It's around Westley, California, around Modesto.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
if the earlier work of looking at the landscape

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
in the recycling work that you're seeing here

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
was starting to point to a direction. To me, it was our redemption.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
That in the recycling work that I was doing,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
That if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
back into the system --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
if we keep doing that -- we can continue on.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Of course, listening at the conference,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
there's many, many things that are coming. Bio-mimicry,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and there's many other things that are coming on stream --

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
to go into that landscape and tear it apart.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And we all look forward to those things.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
But in the meantime, these things are scaling up.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
These things are continuing to happen.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
What you're looking at here -- I went to Bangladesh,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
so I started to move away from North America;

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I started to look at our world globally.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
These images of Bangladesh

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
came out of a radio program I was listening to.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
They were talking about Exxon Valdez,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
because of the insurance industries.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And I thought, "My God, wouldn't that be something?"

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
literally, in third-world countries.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So originally I was going to go to India.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and then I was able to get into Bangladesh,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and saw for the first time a third world, a view of it,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
that I had never actually thought was possible.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
people everywhere -- the pollution was intense,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and the working conditions were horrible.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Here you're looking at some oil fields in California,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
some of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that --

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
there was another epiphany --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that the whole world I was living in was

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
a result of having plentiful oil.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And that, to me, was again something that I started building on,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and I continued to build on.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So this is a series I'm hoping to have ready

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
in about two or three years,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
under the heading of "The Oil Party."

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Because I think everything that we're involved in --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
our clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything -- are directly a result.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I'm going to move to some pictures of China.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And for me China -- I started photographing it four years ago,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
not to mention that China, as well,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I came out of a blue-collar town,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
a GM town, and my father worked at GM,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
so I was very familiar with that kind of industry

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and that also informed my work. But you know,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
to see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Most of the engineers around the world left the project

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
because they said, "It's just too big."

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
In fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
It took fifteen days to fill it.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
one of the largest reservoirs ever created.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And what was also one of the bigger projects around that

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
This is a "before and after." So that was before.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And this is like 10 weeks later, demolished by hand.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
everything else was by hand. That was 10 weeks later.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And this gives you an idea.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And it was all the people who lived in those homes,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
were the ones that were actually taking it apart

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And these are some of the images from that.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
looking at that massive transformation of a landscape.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
This is a need for power, and they're willing to go through this

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000
massive transformation, on this scale, to get that power.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And again, it's actually a relief for what's going on in China

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
because I think on the table right now,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
there's 27 nuclear power stations to be built.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
There hasn't been one built in North America for 20 years

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
because of the "NIMBY" problem -- "Not In My BackYard."

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
But in China they're saying, "No, we're putting in 27 in the next 10 years."

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And coal-burning furnaces are going in there

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
for hydroelectric power literally weekly.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges --

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost;

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
depending on whose statistics you're looking at.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And this is what they were building.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
This is Wushan, one of the largest cities that was relocated.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
This is the town hall for the city.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And again, the rebuilding of the city -- to me, it was sad to see

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
that they didn't really grab a lot of, I guess,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
what we know here, in terms of urban planning.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
There were no parks; there were no green spaces.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Very high-density living on the side of a hill.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
but somehow were not connecting with them.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Here is a sign that, translated, says, "Obey the birth control law.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Build our science, civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth."

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So here, if you look at this poster,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
it has all the trappings of Western culture.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
You're seeing the tuxedos, the bouquets.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
But what's really, to me, frightening about the picture

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and about this billboard is the refinery in the background.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So it's like marrying up all the things that we have

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and it's an adaptation of our way of life, full stop.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And again, when you start seeing that kind of embrace,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
with a very, very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
with a much higher footprint, it starts to become very sobering.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong --

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And there's about 130 million people in migration

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
trying to get into urban centers at all times,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and in the next 10 to 15 years, are expecting

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
another 400 to 500 million people to migrate

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The manufacturers are --

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
the domestics are usually -- you can tell a domestic factory by the fact

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
that they all use the same color uniforms.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
So this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And they have dorms for the workers.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
This is one of the biggest shoe factories, the Yuyuan shoe factory

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
near Shenzhen. It has 90,000 employees making shoes.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
This is a shift change, one of three.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
There's two factories of this scale in the same town.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
This is one with 45,000, so every lunch,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
there's about 12,000 coming through for lunch.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
They sit down; they have about 20 minutes.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
The next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
that's building there. Shanghai --

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and this is a whole area that will be flattened

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
What's also happening in Shanghai is --

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
China is changing because this wouldn't have happened

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
five years ago, for instance. This is a holdout.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
They're called dengzahoos -- they're like pin tacks to the ground.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
They won't move. They're not negotiating.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
They're not getting enough, so they're not going to move.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
because most of them are getting a raw deal.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
They're being put out about two hours --

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
or maybe even thousands of years,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
outside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Probably the largest urban-renewal project, I think,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
ever attempted on the planet.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with --

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
again, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and these are called the villas.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And also, like right now, they're just moving.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
The scaffolding is still on, and this is an e-waste area,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and if you looked in the foreground on the big print,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
you'd see that the industry -- their industry -- they're all recycling.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So the industry's already growing

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
around these new developments.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
This is a five-level bridge in Shanghai.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
that I don't think any city has experienced.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
In fact, even Shenzhen, the economic zone --

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which --

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
There's 9,000 of them here,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
and they're being built for most of the big cities,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Beijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And this isn't even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And what we would see here as a suburban development --

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
a similar thing, but they're all high-rises.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
So they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and they just go up in the same way

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000
as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And the density is quite incredible.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
is that when I saw these kinds of buildings,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I was shocked to see

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
that they're not using a central air-conditioning system;

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
every window has an air conditioner in it.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And I'm sure there are people here who probably

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
know better than I do about efficiencies,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
but I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And when you start looking at that,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
it's literally a forest of skyscrapers.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
It's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
And you can see in the foreground of this picture,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
it's still one of the last areas that was being held up.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Right now that's all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago --

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and high-rises are now going up into that central spot.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.000
So a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Most recently I went in, and I started looking

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
at some of the biggest industries in China.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And this is Baosteel, right outside of Shanghai.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
This is the coal supply for the steel factory -- 18 square kilometers.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000
It's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
five cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
So they're building very large blast furnaces

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
to try to deal with the demand for steel in China.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And again, looking at these images, there's this constant, like, haze that you're seeing.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
This is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
10 hours a day at this speed.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I think one of the issues

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
that we here are facing with China,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
In that one, there were 400 people that worked on the floor.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
and picked this one woman.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And it was just lightning fast;

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
the way she was working was almost unbelievable.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
But that is the trick that they've got right now,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
that they're winning with, is that they're using

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
all the latest technologies and extrusion machines,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
and bringing all the components into play,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in --

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
the country workers are very willing to work. They want to work.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
There's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
That condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
if they realize what they want, which is, you know,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
In this particular case -- this is the assembly line that you saw;

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
this is a shot of it.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
It took me five fake tries

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
because they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
They were just wound up doing these things all day long,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
until the manager had to, with a stern voice, say,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
"Okay, everybody freeze."

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
It wasn't too bad,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.000
This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk, an oil byproduct.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
And what you're seeing here is,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
again, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
There are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
So you have about 12 people running this,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
The machines are all running,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And I started getting in further and further into the factories.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
And that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
to try and get the sense of scale in these places.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
This is a line where they get the threads

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
and they wind the threads together,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
pre-going into the textile mills.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Here's something that's far more labor-intensive,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
which is the making of shoes.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
This floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
The company itself had about 10,000 employees,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
and they're doing domestic shoes.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
It was very hard to get into the international companies

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
and that's very hard to get.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
And they don't want to let me in.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
But the domestic was much easier to do.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
It just gives you a sense of, again -- and that's where,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
really, the whole migration of jobs started going over to China

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
and making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
It was such a high labor component to it

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
This is a high-tech mobile phone: Bird mobile phone,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
one of the largest mobile makers in China.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
I think mobile phone companies

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
are popping up, literally, on a weekly basis,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
This is a textile where they're doing shirts --

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Youngor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Everything is very efficient.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
While setting up this shot,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000
people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
They make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
and the biggest iron makers --

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
they make 20 million of them in the world.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
There's 21,000 employees. This one factory -- and they had several of them --

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
is half a kilometer long.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
These are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
so you're the first ones to be seeing these,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
these new factory pictures I've taken.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
The other aspect of what's happening in China

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
is that there's a real need for materials there.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
are being recycled and taken to China by ships.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
That's cubed metal. This is armatures, electrical armatures,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
where they're getting the copper and the high-end steel

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
from electrical motors out, and recycling them.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
But this is what happens to most of the computers.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
It's referred to as "e-waste" there.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
is that they actually use the coal briquettes,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
which are used all through China, but they heat up the boards,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
But the toxic smells -- when you come into a town

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Here's another operation. It's all cottage industries,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
so it's not big places -- it's all in people's front porches,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
in their backyards, even in their homes they're burning boards,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
if there's a concern for somebody coming by --

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
because it is considered in China to be illegal, doing it,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
but they can't stop the product from coming in.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
This portrait -- I'm not usually known for portraits,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
but I couldn't resist this one, where she's been through Mao,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
and she's been through the Great Leap Forward,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
and the Cultural Revolution, and now she's sitting on her porch

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
with this e-waste beside her. It's quite something.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
This is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
So that's the photographs that I wanted to show you.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
(Applause)

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
They've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
One's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
And to me the whole notion --

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
the things I'm photographing are out of a great concern

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
about the scale of our progress and what we call progress.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
And as much as there are great things around the corner --

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
and it's palpable in this room --

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
of all of the things that are just about to break

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
that can solve so many problems,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
and will start to have a positive effect.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
our footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
that's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
So part of my thinking, and part of my wishes,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
is sitting with these thoughts in mind,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
and thinking about,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
"How is their life going to be when they want to have children,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
or when they're ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
15 years from now?"

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking --

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000
in my work, and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Wish one: world-changing. I want to use my images

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
And it is through communications today

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
that I believe that that is not an unreal idea.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Oh, and I went in search -- I wanted to put what I had in mind,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
hitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
One of them I'm starting from almost nothing, but the other one,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
I wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:17.000
And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blog

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
is now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
And it just started about 14 months ago.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
And the beauty of what's going on there

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
What they're doing there is that they're not --

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
I think the environmental movement has failed

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
in that it's used the stick too much;

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
it's used the apocalyptic tone too much;

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
it hasn't sold the positive aspects of

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
is about positive movements,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
about how to change our world in a better way, quickly.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
And it's looking at technology, and it's looking at new energy-saving devices,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
the movement towards sustainability.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
And so for me, one of the things that I thought

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000
would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
the Worldchanging.com website.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Some of you might know, he's a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
are working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages;

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000
these aren't the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
can be placed into any kind of media.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
They could be posted through the Web;

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000
they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter, or anything of that nature.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
So we're looking at this as trying to build out.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And what we ended up discussing

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
and the text is blasted all over.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
What was unusual, according to Stephen,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
And so in this case,

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
and the kinds of questions they bring up,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
"Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?"

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
And hopefully inspire people to go to that website.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
So Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
and I'm hoping that it isn't -- I don't see it as the kind of blog

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
where we're all going to follow each other to death.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
This one is one that will spoke out, and will go out,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
and to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
in India, in China, in South America --

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
there's entries coming from all around the world.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
I think there's a chance to have a dialogue, a conversation

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
about sustainability at Worldchanging.com.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Wish two is more of the bottom-up, ground-up one that I'm trying to work with.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
And this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000
that motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
And one of the things that came out --

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:37.000
had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
And you think about it, you know,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
grade four -- my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
So it's this great window where they actually are --

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty?

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
You know, we know that from earlier presentations.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000
So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
to start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
and that they have a vested interest in it to happen.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
and the rest is going to be to manage this project,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
was to create these -- call them "prize targets."

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
And so one could be for the best sustainable idea

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
for an in-school project, the best one for a household project,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
or it could be the best community project for sustainability.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
And I also thought there should be a nice prize

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
for the best artwork for "In My World." And what would happen --

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
it's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things --

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
whether it's equipment, like a media lab,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
or money to make the prize significant enough --

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
or schools that are with kids that age,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
and make it a wide-open competition for them

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
to go after those prizes and to submit them.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
And the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it's not about just ideas.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
and do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
In that way, what's happening is that

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
And they're going to push that up, from the bottom -- up into,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
I believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
and trying to help them with the projects.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
in a very positive way,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
but they don't really, I think, get sustainability in all the things,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
and the energy footprint, and how that matters.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
And to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
And again, in "In My World," the competition --

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
And I like the words, "in my world,"

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
It is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it;

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas, I think, come from kids --

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
and engage their imagination into a project,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
and do something for schools.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
I think all schools could use extra equipment, extra cash --

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
it's going to be an incentive for them to do that.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
And these are some of the ideas in terms of where

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.000
we could possibly put in some promotion for "In My World."

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000
And wish three is: Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
And the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with --

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
when I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
"There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer."

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
And I think there's a real possibility

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
to reach new audiences if I had a chance.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
I'm 50, and I don't have time to go back to school right now --

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
I'm too busy. So I need somebody

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
who can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
That would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
(Applause)
