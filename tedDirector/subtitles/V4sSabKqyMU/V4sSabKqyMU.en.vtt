00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Pat Mitchell: You have brought us images from the Yemen Times.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
And take us through those,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and introduce us to another Yemen.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Nadia Al-Sakkaf: Well, I'm glad to be here.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
And I would like to share with you all

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
This picture shows a revolution

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
started by women,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
and it shows women and men

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
leading a mixed protest.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
The other picture

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.260
is the popularity of the real need for change.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
So many people are there.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.260
The intensity of the upspring.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
This picture shows that the revolution

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
has allowed opportunities for training,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
for education.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
These women are learning about first aid

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and their rights according to the constitution.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I love this picture.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
I just wanted to show

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
that over 60 percent of the Yemeni population

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
are 15 years and below.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And they were excluded from decision-making,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and now they are in the forefront of the news,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
raising the flag.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
English --

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
you will see, this is jeans

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and tights,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and an English expression --

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
the ability to share with the world

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
what is going on in our own country.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And expression also,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
it has brought talents.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Yemenis are using cartoons

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
and art,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
paintings, comics,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
to tell the world and each other

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
about what's going on.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
Obviously, there's always the dark side of it.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And this is just one of the less-gruesome pictures

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
of the revolution

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and the cost that we have to pay.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
The solidarity

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
of millions of Yemenis across the country

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
just demanding the one thing.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And finally, lots of people are saying

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
that Yemen's revolution

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
is going to break the country.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Is it going to be so many different countries?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Is it going to be another Somalia?

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
But we want to tell the world that, no,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
under the one flag, we'll still remain as Yemeni people.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
PM: Thank you for those images, Nadia.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
And they do, in many ways,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
tell a different story

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
than the story of Yemen,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
the one that is often in the news.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And yet, you yourself

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
defy all those characterizations.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.260
So let's talk about the personal story for a moment.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Your father is murdered.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
The Yemen Times already has

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
a strong reputation in Yemen

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.260
as an independent English language newspaper.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
How did you then

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
make the decision and assume the responsibilities

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
of running a newspaper,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
especially in such times of conflict?

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
NA: Well, let me first warn you

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
that I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
I've guessed you've already noticed this by now.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
(Laughter)

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
In Yemen, most women are veiled

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and they are sitting behind doors

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and not very much part of the public life.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
But there's so much potential.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
I wish I could show you my Yemen.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
I wish you could see

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
Yemen through my eyes.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Then you would know

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
that there's so much to it.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And I was privileged because I was born into a family,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.260
my father would always encourage the boys and the girls.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
He would say we are equal.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And he was such an extraordinary man.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And even my mother -- I owe it to my family.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
A story:

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
I studied in India.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And in my third year, I started becoming confused

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
because I was Yemeni,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
but I was also mixing up

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
with a lot of my friends in college.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And I went back home and I said,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
"Daddy, I don't know who I am.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
I'm not a Yemeni; I'm not an Indian."

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
And he said, "You are the bridge."

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.260
And that is something I will keep in my heart forever.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
So since then I've been the bridge,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and a lot of people have walked over me.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
PM: I don't think so. (Laughter)

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
NA: But it just helps tell

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
that some people are change agents

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
in the society.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And when I became editor-in-chief

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
after my brother actually --

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
my father passed away in 1999,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and then my brother until 2005 --

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
"What's this young girl coming in and showing off

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
because it's her family business," or something.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
It was very hard at first.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
I didn't want to clash with people.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
But with all due respect

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
to all the men, and the older men especially,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
they did not want me around.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
It was very hard, you know,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.260
to impose my authority.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.260
But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.260
(Applause)

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And in the first year,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
I had to fire half of the men.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
(Laughter)

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.260
(Applause)

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Brought in more women.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Brought in younger men.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.260
And we have a more gender-balanced newsroom today.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
The other thing is that it's about professionalism.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
It's about proving who you are and what you can do.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And I don't know if I'm going to be boasting now,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
but in 2006 alone,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
we won three international awards.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
One of them is the IPI

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
Free Media Pioneer Award.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
So that was the answer

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
to all the Yemeni people.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
And I want to score a point here,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
because my husband is in the room over there.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.260
If you could please stand up, [unclear].

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
He has been very supportive of me.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.260
(Applause)

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
PM: And we should point out

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
that he works with you as well at the paper.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
But in assuming this responsibility

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
and going about it as you have,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
you have become a bridge

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.260
between an older and traditional society

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
and the one that you are now creating at the paper.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
And so along with changing who worked there,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
you must have come up against another positioning

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
that we always run into, in particular with women,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and it has to do with outside image,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
dress, the veiled woman.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
So how have you dealt with this

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
on a personal level

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
as well as the women who worked for you?

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
NA: As you know,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
and covered, veiled women.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And this is true.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And a lot of it is

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
because women are not able, are not free,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
to show their face to their self.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
It's a lot of traditional imposing

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
coming by authority figures

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
such as the men, the grandparents and so on.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
And it's economic empowerment

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
and the ability for a woman to say,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
"I am as much contributing to this family, or more,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
than you are."

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And the more empowered the women become,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
the more they are able to remove the veil, for example,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
or to drive their own car

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
or to have a job or to be able to travel.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
So the other face of Yemen

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
is actually one

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
that lies behind the veil,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and it's economic empowerment mostly

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
that allows the woman to just uncover it.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
And I have done this throughout my work.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
I've tried to encourage young girls.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.260
We started with, you can take it off in the office.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And then after that, you can take it off on assignments.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Because I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with --

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
how can you talk to people if you have your face covered? --

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
and so on; it's just a movement.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
And I am a role model in Yemen.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
A lot of people look up to me.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
A lot of young girls look up to me.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And I need to prove to them that, yes, you can still be married,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
you can still be a mother,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
and you can still be respected within the society,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
but at the same time,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
that doesn't mean you [should] just be one of the crowd.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
You can be yourself and have your face.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.260
PM: But by putting yourself personally out there --

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
both projecting a different image

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
of Yemeni women,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
but also what you have made possible

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
for the women who work at the paper --

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.260
has this put you in personal danger?

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
NA: Well the Yemen Times, across 20 years,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
has been through so much.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
We've suffered prosecution;

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
the paper was closed down more than three times.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
It's an independent newspaper,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
but tell that to the people in charge.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
They think that if there's anything against them,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.260
then we are being an opposition newspaper.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
And very, very difficult times.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Some of my reporters were arrested.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
We had some court cases.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
My father was assassinated.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Today, we are in a much better situation.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
We've created the credibility.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
And in times of revolution or change like today,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.260
it is very important for independent media to have a voice.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
It's very important

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
for you to go to YemenTimes.com,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
and it's very important

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
to listen to our voice.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And this is probably something

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
I'm going to share with you

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
in Western media probably --

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.260
and how there's a lot of stereotypes --

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
thinking of Yemen in one single frame:

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
this is what Yemen is all about.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
And that's not fair.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
It's not fair for me; it's not fair for my country.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
A lot of reporters come to Yemen

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
and they want to write a story on Al-Qaeda or terrorism.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And I just wanted to share with you:

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
there's one reporter that came.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
He wanted to do a documentary

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.260
on what his editors wanted.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me --

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
hip hop --

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
that there are young Yemeni men

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
who express themselves

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
through dancing and puchu puchu.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
(Laughter)

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
That thing. (PM: Rap. Break dancing.)

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Yeah, break dancing.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
I'm not so old.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
I'm just not in touch.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
(Laughter)

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
(Applause)

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
PM: Yes, you are.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
Actually, that's a documentary

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
that's available online; the video's online.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
NA: ShaketheDust.org.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
PM: "Shake the Dust." (NA: "Shake the Dust.")

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
PM: ShaketheDust.org.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
And it definitely does give a different image of Yemen.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
You spoke about the responsibility of the press.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
And certainly, when we look

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
and we've created fear

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
and danger,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
often from lack of knowledge,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
lack of real understanding,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
how do you see

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
the way that the Western press in particular

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
is covering this and all other stories out of the region,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
but in particular, in your country?

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
NA: Well there is a saying that says,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
"You fear what you don't know,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
and you hate what you fear."

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
So it's about the lack of research, basically.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
It's almost, "Do your homework," --

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
some involvement.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
And you cannot do parachute reporting --

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
just jump into a country for two days

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and think that you've done your homework and a story.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
So I wish

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
that the world would know my Yemen,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
my country, my people.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
I am an example, and there are others like me.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
We may not be that many,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
but if we are promoted

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
as a good, positive example,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
there will be others -- men and women --

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
who can eventually bridge the gap --

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
again, coming to the bridge --

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
between Yemen and the world

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
and telling first

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
about recognition

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
and then about communication

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
and compassion.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
I think Yemen is going to be

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
in a very bad situation

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
in the next two or three years.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
It's natural.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
But after the two years, which is a price we are willing to pay,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
we are going to stand up again on our feet,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
but in the new Yemen

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
with a younger and more empowered people --

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
democratic.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:49.260
(Applause)

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
PM: Nadia, I think you've just given us

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
a very different view of Yemen.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
And certainly you yourself and what you do

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
have given us a view of the future

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
that we will embrace

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
and be grateful for.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And the very best of luck to you.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
YemenTimes.com.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
NA: On Twitter also.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
PM: So you are plugged in.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:32.260
(Applause)
