00:00:16.103 --> 00:00:18.148
I'd like to show you a video of some of the models

00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:19.737
I work with.

00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:23.275
They're all the perfect size, and they don't have an ounce of fat.

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:25.813
Did I mention they're gorgeous?

00:00:25.813 --> 00:00:28.943
And they're scientific models? (Laughs)

00:00:28.943 --> 00:00:31.286
As you might have guessed, I'm a tissue engineer,

00:00:31.286 --> 00:00:33.735
and this is a video of some of the beating heart

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:35.951
that I've engineered in the lab.

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:37.833
And one day we hope that these tissues

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:40.777
can serve as replacement parts for the human body.

00:00:40.777 --> 00:00:43.057
But what I'm going to tell you about today

00:00:43.057 --> 00:00:47.504
is how these tissues make awesome models.

00:00:47.504 --> 00:00:50.231
Well, let's think about the drug screening process for a moment.

00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:53.209
You go from drug formulation, lab testing, animal testing,

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:55.712
and then clinical trials, which you might call human testing,

00:00:55.712 --> 00:00:57.977
before the drugs get to market.

00:00:57.977 --> 00:01:01.120
It costs a lot of money, a lot of time,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.930
and sometimes, even when a drug hits the market,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.865
it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people.

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:11.952
And the later it fails, the worse the consequences.

00:01:11.952 --> 00:01:16.136
It all boils down to two issues. One, humans are not rats,

00:01:16.136 --> 00:01:20.224
and two, despite our incredible similarities to one another,

00:01:20.224 --> 00:01:22.665
actually those tiny differences between you and I

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.174
have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs

00:01:25.174 --> 00:01:27.043
and how those drugs affect us.

00:01:27.043 --> 00:01:29.875
So what if we had better models in the lab

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:33.145
that could not only mimic us better than rats

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:37.065
but also reflect our diversity?

00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:40.992
Let's see how we can do it with tissue engineering.

00:01:40.992 --> 00:01:43.521
One of the key technologies that's really important

00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:46.713
is what's called induced pluripotent stem cells.

00:01:46.713 --> 00:01:49.231
They were developed in Japan pretty recently.

00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:51.678
Okay, induced pluripotent stem cells.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.791
They're a lot like embryonic stem cells

00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:56.008
except without the controversy.

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:58.907
We induce cells, okay, say, skin cells,

00:01:58.907 --> 00:02:01.414
by adding a few genes to them, culturing them,

00:02:01.414 --> 00:02:03.035
and then harvesting them.

00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:05.742
So they're skin cells that can be tricked,

00:02:05.742 --> 00:02:08.526
kind of like cellular amnesia, into an embryonic state.

00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:11.238
So without the controversy, that's cool thing number one.

00:02:11.238 --> 00:02:13.787
Cool thing number two, you can grow any type of tissue

00:02:13.787 --> 00:02:16.342
out of them: brain, heart, liver, you get the picture,

00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:18.865
but out of your cells.

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:22.430
So we can make a model of your heart, your brain

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.062
on a chip.

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:27.918
Generating tissues of predictable density and behavior

00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:30.750
is the second piece, and will be really key towards

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.422
getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery.

00:02:33.422 --> 00:02:36.534
And this is a schematic of a bioreactor we're developing in our lab

00:02:36.534 --> 00:02:39.982
to help engineer tissues in a more modular, scalable way.

00:02:39.982 --> 00:02:43.381
Going forward, imagine a massively parallel version of this

00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:45.718
with thousands of pieces of human tissue.

00:02:45.718 --> 00:02:49.766
It would be like having a clinical trial on a chip.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:53.561
But another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells

00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:56.110
is that if we take some skin cells, let's say,

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.286
from people with a genetic disease

00:02:58.286 --> 00:03:00.542
and we engineer tissues out of them,

00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:02.510
we can actually use tissue-engineering techniques

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.911
to generate models of those diseases in the lab.

00:03:05.911 --> 00:03:09.495
Here's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard.

00:03:09.495 --> 00:03:11.785
He generated neurons

00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:14.500
from these induced pluripotent stem cells

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.129
from patients who have Lou Gehrig's Disease,

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.572
and he differentiated them into neurons, and what's amazing

00:03:19.572 --> 00:03:22.724
is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease.

00:03:22.724 --> 00:03:24.823
So with disease models like these, we can fight back

00:03:24.823 --> 00:03:27.405
faster than ever before and understand the disease better

00:03:27.405 --> 00:03:31.368
than ever before, and maybe discover drugs even faster.

00:03:31.368 --> 00:03:34.748
This is another example of patient-specific stem cells

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:38.757
that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa.

00:03:38.757 --> 00:03:40.511
This is a degeneration of the retina.

00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:43.268
It's a disease that runs in my family, and we really hope

00:03:43.268 --> 00:03:45.492
that cells like these will help us find a cure.

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:48.300
So some people think that these models sound well and good,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.741
but ask, "Well, are these really as good as the rat?"

00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:54.729
The rat is an entire organism, after all,

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.435
with interacting networks of organs.

00:03:56.435 --> 00:04:00.356
A drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver,

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:03.196
and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat.

00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:07.723
Don't you miss all that with these tissue-engineered models?

00:04:07.723 --> 00:04:09.837
Well, this is another trend in the field.

00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:12.704
By combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics,

00:04:12.704 --> 00:04:14.868
the field is actually evolving towards just that,

00:04:14.868 --> 00:04:17.374
a model of the entire ecosystem of the body,

00:04:17.374 --> 00:04:19.774
complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test

00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:21.377
how a drug you might take for your blood pressure

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:24.644
might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart.

00:04:24.644 --> 00:04:28.716
These systems are really hard to build, but we're just starting to be able to get there,

00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:32.020
and so, watch out.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.652
But that's not even all of it, because once a drug is approved,

00:04:34.652 --> 00:04:38.334
tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments.

00:04:38.334 --> 00:04:42.076
This is an example that you might care about someday,

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:44.196
and I hope you never do,

00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:46.716
because imagine if you ever get that call

00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:49.924
that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer.

00:04:49.924 --> 00:04:52.460
Wouldn't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.220
you're going to take are going to work on your cancer?

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.642
This is an example from Karen Burg's lab, where they're

00:04:57.642 --> 00:05:00.548
using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells

00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:03.019
and study its progressions and treatments.

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:05.572
And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models

00:05:05.572 --> 00:05:08.660
like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.380
might spread from one part of the body to the next,

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.764
and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips

00:05:13.764 --> 00:05:16.749
to be the next generation of these kinds of studies.

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.171
And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed,

00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:21.084
you can see, going forward, that tissue engineering

00:05:21.084 --> 00:05:23.540
is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.318
at every single step of the path:

00:05:26.318 --> 00:05:28.892
disease models making for better drug formulations,

00:05:28.892 --> 00:05:32.763
massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing,

00:05:32.763 --> 00:05:36.988
reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials,

00:05:36.988 --> 00:05:38.680
and individualized therapies that disrupt

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.268
what we even consider to be a market at all.

00:05:42.268 --> 00:05:44.812
Essentially, we're dramatically speeding up that feedback

00:05:44.812 --> 00:05:47.135
between developing a molecule and learning about

00:05:47.135 --> 00:05:49.484
how it acts in the human body.

00:05:49.484 --> 00:05:51.812
Our process for doing this is essentially transforming

00:05:51.812 --> 00:05:56.673
biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology,

00:05:56.673 --> 00:05:59.652
helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster,

00:05:59.652 --> 00:06:02.868
more cheaply and more effectively.

00:06:02.868 --> 00:06:06.948
It gives new meaning to models against animal testing, doesn't it?

00:06:06.948 --> 00:06:13.763
Thank you. (Applause)
