00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
There was a time in my life

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
when everything seemed perfect.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Everywhere I went, I felt at home.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Everyone I met,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I felt I knew them for as long as I could remember.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And I want to share with you how I came to that place

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and what I've learned since I left it.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
This is where it began.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
And it raises an existential question,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
which is, if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
why am I not visible in the photograph,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and where is this time and place?

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
This is Los Angeles, California, where I live.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
This is a police photo. That's actually my car.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
We're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
called Cedars-Sinai.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And the situation is that a car full of paramedics

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
on their way home from the hospital after work

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
have run across the wreckage,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and they've advised the police

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
that there were no survivors inside the car,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
that the driver's dead, that I'm dead.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
And the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
to cut apart the vehicle

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
to extract the body of the driver.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And when they do, they find that behind the glass,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
they find me.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And my skull's crushed and my collar bone is crushed;

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
all but two of my ribs,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
my pelvis and both arms --

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
they're all crushed, but there is still a pulse.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
And they get me to that nearby hospital,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Cedars-Sinai,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
where that night I receive, because of my internal bleeding,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
45 units of blood --

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
which means full replacements of all the blood in me --

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
before they're able to staunch the flow.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
I'm put on full life support,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
and I have a massive stroke,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
and my brain drops into a coma.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Now comas are measured

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
on a scale from 15 down to three.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Fifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And if you look, you'll see that there's only one way you can score three.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
It's essentially there's no sign of life

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
from outside at all.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I spent more than a month in a Glasgow Coma Scale three,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and it is inside that deepest level of coma,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
on the rim between my life and my death,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
that I'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
of inner space.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
From my family looking in from outside,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
what they're trying to figure out

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
is a different kind of existential question,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
which is, how far is it going to be possible to bridge

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
from the comatose potential mind that they're looking at

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
to an actual mind,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
which I define simply

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
as the functioning of the brain

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
that is remaining inside my head.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Now to put this into a broader context,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
I want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
watching the Earth from outer space,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
is the Earth channel,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and your favorite show is the Human Show.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
is because consciousness is so interesting.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
It's so unpredictable

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and so fragile.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And this is how we began.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
The show began with tremendous special effects,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
because there were catastrophic climate shifts --

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Because of the Earth tilting on its axis

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and those catastrophic climate shifts,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
we had to figure out how to find better food,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and we had to learn -- there's Lucy; that's how we all began --

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
we had to learn how to crack open animal bones,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
use tools to do that, to feed on the marrow,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
to grow our brains more.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
So we actually grew our consciousness

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
in response to this global threat.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Now you also continue to watch

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
as consciousness evolved to the point

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
that here in India, in Madhya Pradesh,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.260
there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.260
It's a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and it's the first known expression of art

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
on the planet.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And the reason it connects us with consciousness today

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
is that all of us still today,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
the very first shape we draw as a child

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
is a circle.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
And then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
We create an eye --

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and the eye that evolves through all of our history.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
There's the Egyptian god Horus,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
which symbolizes prosperity, wisdom and health.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
And that comes down right way to the present

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
with the dollar bill in the United States,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
which has on it an eye of providence.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
So watching all of this show from outer space,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
you think we get it, we understand

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
that the most precious resource on the blue planet

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
is our consciousness.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Because it's the first thing we draw;

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
we surround ourselves with images of it;

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
it's probably the most common image on the planet.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
But we don't. We take our consciousness for granted.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
While I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
Until it was stripped from me, I never thought about it.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And what I've learned since that event

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and during my recovery

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
is that consciousness is under threat on this planet

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
in ways it's never been under threat before.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
These are just some examples.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And the reason I'm so honored to be here

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
to talk today in India

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
is because India has the sad distinction

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
of being the head injury capital of the world.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
That statistic is so sad.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
There is no more drastic and sudden gap created

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
between potential and actual mind

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
than a severe head injury.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
which means that India, unless something changes,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
is accumulating a need

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
for millennia of rehabilitation.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
What you find in the United States

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
is an injury every 20 seconds -- that's one and a half million every year --

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
stroke every 40 seconds,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Alzheimer's disease, every 70 seconds somebody succumbs to that.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
All of these represent gaps

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
between potential mind and actual mind.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And here are some of the other categories, if you look at the whole planet.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
The World Health Organization tells us

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
that depression is the number one disease on Earth

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
in terms of years lived with disability.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
We find that the number two source of disability

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
is depression in the age group

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
of 15 to 44.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Our children are becoming depressed

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
at an alarming rate.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
I discovered during my recovery

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
is suicide.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
If you look at some of these other items -- concussions.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
Half of E.R. admissions from adolescents

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
are for concussions.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
If I talk about migraine,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
40 percent of the population

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
suffer episodic headaches.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
Fifteen percent suffer migraines

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
that wipe them out for days on end.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
All of this is leading -- computer addiction,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
just to cover that: the most frequent thing we do

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
is use digital devices.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
The average teenager

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
sends 3,300 texts every [month].

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
We're talking about a society that is retreating

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
into depression and disassociation

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
when we are potentially confronting

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
the next great catastrophic climate shift.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
So what you'd be wondering, watching the Human Show,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
is are we going to confront and address

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
by growing our consciousness,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
or are we going to continue to retreat?

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And that then might lead you

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
to watch an episode one day

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
of Cedars-Sinai medical center

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
This is a dense array EEG MRI

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
tracking 156 channels of information.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
It's not my EEG at Cedars;

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
it's your EEG tonight and last night.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
It's the what our minds do every night

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
to digest the day

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we're asleep

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
This is how I was when I returned from the hospital

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
after nearly four months.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
The horseshoe shape you can see on my skull

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
is where they operated and went inside my brain

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
But if you look into the eye of consciousness, that single eye you can see,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
I'm looking down,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
but let me tell you how I felt at that point.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
I didn't feel empty; I felt everything simultaneously.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
I felt empty and full, hot and cold,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
euphoric and depressed

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
because the brain is the world's first

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
fully functional quantum computer;

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
it can occupy multiple states at the same time.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
I felt everything simultaneously.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
But let's swivel around and look at me frontally.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
This is now flash-forward to the point in time

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
where I've been discharged by the health system.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
Look into those eyes. I'm not able to focus those eyes.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
I'm not able to follow a line of text in a book.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
But the system has moved me on

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
because, as my family started to discover,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
there is no long-term concept

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
in the health care system.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
Neurological damage, 10 years of rehab,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
requires a long-term perspective.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
But let's take a look behind my eyes.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
This is a gamma radiation spec scan

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
that uses gamma radiation

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
to map three-dimensional function within the brain.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
It requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
but in two dimensions I think you can see

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
the beautiful symmetry and illumination

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
of a normal mind at work.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
Here's my brain.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
That is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
being destroyed by the stroke.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
So my family, as we moved forward

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and discovered that the health care system had moved us by,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
had to try to find solutions and answers.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
And during that process -- it took many years --

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
one of the doctors said that my recovery, my degree of advance,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
since the amount of head injury I'd suffered,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
was miraculous.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
And that was when I started to write a book,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
because I didn't think it was miraculous.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
I thought there were miraculous elements,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
but I also didn't think it was right

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
that one should have to struggle and search for answers

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
when this is a pandemic within our society.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
So from this experience of my recovery,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
I want to share four particular aspects --

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
I call them the four C's of consciousness --

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
that helped me grow my potential mind

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
back towards the actual mind that I work with every day.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
The first C is cognitive training.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Unlike the smashed glass of my car,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
plasticity of the brain

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
means that there was always a possibility, with treatment,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
to train the brain

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Plasticity means that there was always

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
hope for our reason --

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
hope for our ability to rebuild that function.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Indeed, the mind can redefine itself,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silva

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
back in the 1970's.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
The global perspective

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
is that up to 30 percent of children in school

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
have learning weaknesses

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
that are not self-correcting,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
but with appropriate treatment,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
they can be screened for and detected and corrected

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and avoid their academic failure.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
But what I discovered is it's almost impossible to find anyone

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
who provides that treatment or care.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Here's what my neuropsychologist provided for me

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
when I actually found somebody who could apply it.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
I'm not a doctor, so I'm not going to talk about the various subtests.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Let's just talk about full-scale I.Q.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Full-scale I.Q. is the mental processing --

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
how fast you can acquire information,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
retain it and retrieve it --

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
that is essential for success in life today.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
And you can see here there are three columns.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
Untestable -- that's when I'm in my coma.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
And then I creep up to the point that I get a score of 79,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
which is just below average.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
In the health care system, if you touch average, you're done.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
That's when I was discharged from the system.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
What does average I.Q. really mean?

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
It meant that when I was given two and a half hours

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
to take a test that anyone here

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
would take in 50 minutes,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
I might score an F.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
This is a very, very low level

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
in order to be kicked out of the health care system.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
Then I underwent cognitive training.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And let me show you what happened to the right-hand column

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
when I did my cognitive training over a period of time.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
This is not supposed to occur.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
I.Q. is supposed to stabilize and solidify

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
at the age of eight.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
Now the Journal of the National Medical Association

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
gave my memoir a full clinical review,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
which is very unusual.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
I'm not a doctor. I have no medical background whatsoever.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
But they felt the evidences

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
that there was important, valuable information in the book,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
But they asked one question. They said, "Is this repeatable?"

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
That was a fair question

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
because my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
The answer is yes, and for the first time,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
it's my pleasure to be able to share two examples.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
Here's somebody, what they did as they went through cognitive training

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
at ages seven and 11.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
And here's another person in, call it, high school and college.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
And this person is particularly interesting.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
I won't go into the intrascatter that's in the subtests,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
but they still had a neurologic issue.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
But that person could be identified

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
as having a learning disability.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
And with accommodation, they went on to college

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
and had a full life in terms of their opportunities.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
Second aspect:

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
I still had crushing migraine headaches.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Two elements that worked for me here

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.260
are -- the first is 90 percent, I learned, of head and neck pain

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
is through muscular-skeletal imbalance.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.260
The craniomandibular system is critical to that.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
And when I underwent it and found solutions,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
this is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
Up to 30 percent of the population

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
have a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jaw

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
that affects the entire body.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
I was fortunate to find a dentist

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
who applied this entire universe

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
of technology you're about to see

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
to establish that if he repositioned my jaw,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
the headaches pretty much resolved,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
but that then my teeth weren't in the right place.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
He then held my jaw in the right position

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.260
while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
This affected my entire body.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
If that sounds like a very, very strange thing to say

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and rather a bold statement --

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
How can the jaw affect the entire body? --

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
let me simply point out to you,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
if I ask you tomorrow

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
to put one grain of sand between your teeth

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
and go for a nice long walk,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
how far would you last

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
before you had to remove that grain of sand?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
That tiny misalignment.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
Bear in mind, there are no nerves in the teeth.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
That's why the same between the before and after that this shows,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
it's hard to see the difference.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
Now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and see the difference it makes.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
I still had migraine headaches.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
The next issue that resolved

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
was that, if 90 percent of head and neck pain

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
is caused by imbalance,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
the other 10 percent, largely --

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
if you set aside aneurysms, brain cancer

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
and hormonal issues --

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
is the circulation.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Imagine the blood flowing through your body --

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
I was told at UCLA Medical Center --

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
as one sealed system.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
There's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
and around that pipe are the nerves

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
drawing their nutrient supply from the blood.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
That's basically it.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
If you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
it bulges someplace else.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
If that some place else where it bulges

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
is inside the biggest nerve in your body, your brain,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
you get a vascular migraine.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
This is a level of pain that's only known

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
to other people who suffer vascular migraines.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Using this technology,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
this is mapping in three dimensions.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
This is an MRI MRA MRV,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
a volumetric MRI.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
Using this technology, the specialists at UCLA Medical Center

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
were able to identify

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.260
A vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
And in the following months and years,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
I felt the neurological flow of life itself returning.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
Communication, the next C. This is critical.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
All consciousness is about communication.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
And here, by great fortune,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
one of my father's clients

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
had a husband who worked

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
at the Alfred Mann Foundation for Scientific Research.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
Alfred Mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
who's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
whether to restore hearing to the deaf, vision to the blind

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
or movement to the paralyzed.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
And I'm just going to give you an example today

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
of movement to the paralyzed.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
I've brought with me, from Southern California,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
the FM device.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
This is it being held in the hand.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
It weighs less than a gram.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
So two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
Five of them would still weigh less

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
than a rupee coin.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
Where does it go inside the body?

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
It has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
for over 80 years.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
So it goes in and it stays there.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
Here are the implantation sites.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
The concept that they're working towards -- and they have working prototypes --

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
where they're needed.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
The main unit will then go inside the brain.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
An FM device in the cortex of the brain, the motor cortex,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
will send signals in real time

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
to the motor points in the relevant muscles

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
so that the person will be able to move their arm, let's say, in real time,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
if they've lost control of their arm.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
And other FM devices implanted in fingertips,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
on contacting a surface,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
so that the person feels a sense of touch.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
Is this science fiction? No,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
because I'm wearing the first application of this technology.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
I don't have the ability to control my left foot.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
A radio device is controlling every step I take,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
and a sensor picks up my foot for me

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
every time I walk.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
And in closing, I want to share

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
the personal reason why this meant so much to me

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
and changed the direction of my life.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
In my coma, one of the presences I sensed

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
was someone I felt was a protector.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
And when I came out of my coma, I recognized my family,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
but I didn't remember my own past.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
Gradually, I remembered the protector was my wife.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
And I whispered the good news

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
through my broken jaw, which was wired shut,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
to my night nurse.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
And the following morning, my mother came to explain

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
that I'd not always been in this bed, in this room,

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
that I'd been working in film and television

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
and that I had been in a crash

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
and that, yes, I was married,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
but Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
And during my time in coma,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.260
she had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
Now in the dark years that followed, I had to work out what remained for me

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.260
if everything that made today special was gone.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
And as I discovered these threats to consciousness

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
and how they are surrounding the world

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
I discovered what truly remained.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.260
I believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
that the Human Show can stay on the air

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
for millennia to come.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
I believe that we can all rise and shine.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:06.260
(Applause)

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.260
Lakshmi Pratury: Just stay for a second. Just stay here for a second.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.260
(Applause)

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
You know,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.260
when I heard Simon's --

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
please sit down; I just want to talk to him for a second --

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.260
when I read his book, I went to LA to meet him.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.260
And so I was sitting in this restaurant,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.260
waiting for a man to come by

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.260
who obviously would have some difficulty ...

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
I don't know what I had in my mind.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
And he was walking around.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
I didn't expect that person that I was going to meet

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
to be him.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
And then we met and we talked,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
and I'm like, he doesn't look

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.260
like somebody who was built out of nothing.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
And then I was amazed

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
at what role technology played

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
in your recovery.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
And we have his book outside

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.260
in the bookshop.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
The thing that amazed me

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.260
is the painstaking detail

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.260
with which he has written

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
every hospital he has been to,

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
every treatment he got,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.260
every near-miss he had,

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.260
and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:23.260
So I think this one detail

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.260
went past people really quick.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.260
Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
Simon Lewis: I knew when I was timing this

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
that there wouldn't be time for me to do anything about --

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.260
Well this is it. This is the control unit.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.260
And this records every single step I've taken

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.260
for, ooh, five or six years now.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.260
And if I do this, probably the mic won't hear it.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.260
That little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.260
When I press it again, it'll chirp three times,

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.260
and that'll mean that it's armed and ready to go.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.260
And that's my friend. I mean, I charge it every night.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.260
And it works. It works.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.260
And what I would love to add because I didn't have time ...

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.260
What does it do? Well actually, I'll show you down here.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.260
This down here, if the camera can see that,

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.260
that is a small antenna.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.260
Underneath my heel, there is a sensor

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.260
that detects when my foot leaves the ground --

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.260
what's called the heel lift.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.260
This thing blinks all the time; I'll leave it out, so you might be able to see it.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.260
But this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.260
And if you walk faster, if I walk faster,

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.260
it detects what's called the time interval,

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.260
which is the interval between each heel lift.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.260
And it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.260
The other things they've worked on -- I didn't have time to say this in my talk --

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.260
is they've restored functional hearing

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.260
to thousands of deaf people.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.260
I could tell you the story: this was going to be an abandoned technology,

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.260
but Alfred Mann met the doctor who was going to retire,

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.260
[Dr. Schindler.]

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.260
And he was going to retire -- all the technology was going to be lost,

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.260
because not a single medical manufacturer would take it on

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.260
because it was a small issue.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.260
But there's millions of deaf people in the world,

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.260
and the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.260
It works.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.260
And the other thing is they're working on artificial retinas for the blind.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.260
And this, this is the implantable generation.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.260
Because what I didn't say in my talk

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.260
is this is actually exoskeletal.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.260
I should clarify that.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.260
Because the first generation is exoskeletal,

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.260
it's wrapped around the leg,

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.260
around the affected limb.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.260
I must tell you, they're an amazing --

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.260
there's a hundred people who work in that building --

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.260
engineers, scientists,

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.260
and other team members -- all the time.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.260
Alfred Mann has set up this foundation

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.260
to advance this research

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.260
because he saw

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.260
there's no way venture capital would come in for something like this.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.260
The audience is too small.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.260
You'd think, there's plenty of paralyzed people in the world,

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.260
but the audience is too small,

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.260
and the amount of research, the time it takes,

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.260
the FDA clearances,

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.260
the payback time is too long

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.260
for V.C. to be interested.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.260
So he saw a need and he stepped in.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.260
He's a very, very remarkable man.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.260
He's done a lot of very cutting-edge science.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.260
LP: So when you get a chance, spend some time with Simon.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.260
Thank you. Thank you.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.260
(Applause)
