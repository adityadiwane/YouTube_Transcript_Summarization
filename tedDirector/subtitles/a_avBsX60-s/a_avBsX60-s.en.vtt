00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:15.768
So, my mother's a pediatrician,

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:19.606
and when I was young,
she'd tell the craziest stories

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.853
that combined science
with her overactive imagination.

00:00:23.444 --> 00:00:27.595
One of the stories she told
was that if you eat a lot of salt,

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.288
all of the blood rushes up your legs,

00:00:31.312 --> 00:00:32.564
through your body,

00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:34.667
and shoots out the top of your head,

00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:36.393
killing you instantly.

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:37.477
(Laughter)

00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:39.313
She called it "high blood pressure."

00:00:39.337 --> 00:00:40.981
(Laughter)

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:43.915
This was my first experience
with science fiction,

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:45.224
and I loved it.

00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:48.898
So when I started to write
my own science fiction and fantasy,

00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:51.416
I was surprised that it
was considered un-African.

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:54.729
So naturally, I asked, what is African?

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:56.613
And this is what I know so far:

00:00:57.555 --> 00:00:59.077
Africa is important.

00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:01.274
Africa is the future.

00:01:01.298 --> 00:01:02.564
It is, though.

00:01:03.074 --> 00:01:07.397
And Africa is a serious place
where only serious things happen.

00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:11.896
So when I present my work somewhere,
someone will always ask,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.491
"What's so important about it?

00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:17.034
How does it deal with real African issues

00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:22.426
like war, poverty, devastation or AIDS?"

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.659
And it doesn't.

00:01:24.107 --> 00:01:29.444
My work is about Nairobi pop bands
that want to go to space

00:01:29.468 --> 00:01:32.596
or about seven-foot-tall robots

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.092
that fall in love.

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:37.706
It's nothing incredibly important.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.113
It's just fun, fierce and frivolous,

00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:43.748
as frivolous as bubble gum --

00:01:43.772 --> 00:01:45.107
"AfroBubbleGum."

00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:49.506
So I'm not saying that
agenda art isn't important;

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.805
I'm the chairperson of a charity

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:58.786
that deals with films and theaters
that write about HIV and radicalization

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.073
and female genital mutilation.

00:02:01.097 --> 00:02:03.378
It's vital and important art,

00:02:03.402 --> 00:02:06.954
but it cannot be the only art
that comes out of the continent.

00:02:08.192 --> 00:02:10.528
We have to tell more stories

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:11.967
that are vibrant.

00:02:13.097 --> 00:02:17.048
The danger of the single story
is still being realized.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.698
And maybe it's because of the funding.

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:23.625
A lot of art is still dependent
on developmental aid.

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.515
So art becomes a tool for agenda.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.148
Or maybe it's because we've only seen
one image of ourselves for so long

00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:34.619
that that's all we know how to create.

00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:37.816
Whatever the reason, we need a new way,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.685
and AfroBubbleGum is one approach.

00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:43.687
It's the advocacy of art for art's sake.

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.485
It's the advocacy of art
that is not policy-driven

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.041
or agenda-driven

00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:51.004
or based on education,

00:02:51.028 --> 00:02:54.394
just for the sake of imagination:

00:02:54.418 --> 00:02:55.971
AfroBubbleGum art.

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.035
And we can't all be AfroBubbleGumists.

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:03.105
We have to judge our work
for its potential poverty porn pitfalls.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.382
We have to have tests
that are similar to the Bechdel test,

00:03:09.184 --> 00:03:10.897
and ask questions like:

00:03:11.475 --> 00:03:15.043
Are two or more Africans
in this piece of fiction healthy?

00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:22.111
Are those same Africans financially stable
and not in need of saving?

00:03:23.193 --> 00:03:26.081
Are they having fun and enjoying life?

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:29.203
And if we can answer yes
to two or more of these questions,

00:03:29.227 --> 00:03:31.198
then surely we're AfroBubbleGumists.

00:03:31.855 --> 00:03:33.404
(Laughter)

00:03:33.428 --> 00:03:38.205
(Applause)

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:39.718
And fun is political,

00:03:40.267 --> 00:03:44.519
because imagine if we have
images of Africans who were vibrant

00:03:44.543 --> 00:03:46.586
and loving and thriving

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.898
and living a beautiful, vibrant life.

00:03:48.922 --> 00:03:51.303
What would we think of ourselves then?

00:03:51.327 --> 00:03:54.174
Would we think that maybe
we're worthy of more happiness?

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.638
Would we think of our shared humanity
through our shared joy?

00:03:59.387 --> 00:04:01.317
I think of these things when I create.

00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:04.968
I think of the people and the places
that give me immeasurable joy,

00:04:04.992 --> 00:04:06.975
and I work to represent them.

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:08.636
And that's why I write stories

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.130
about futuristic girls that risk
everything to save plants

00:04:13.154 --> 00:04:15.383
or to race camels

00:04:15.407 --> 00:04:17.847
or even just to dance,

00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:19.592
to honor fun,

00:04:19.616 --> 00:04:21.739
because my world is mostly happy.

00:04:21.763 --> 00:04:25.533
And I know happiness is a privilege
in this current splintered world

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:29.311
where remaining hopeful
requires diligence.

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:36.448
But maybe, if you join me
in creating, curating and commissioning

00:04:36.472 --> 00:04:38.501
more AfroBubbleGum art,

00:04:38.525 --> 00:04:41.303
there might be hope
for a different view of the world,

00:04:41.327 --> 00:04:43.483
a happy Africa view

00:04:43.507 --> 00:04:45.535
where children are strangely traumatized

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:47.502
by their mother's dark sense of humor,

00:04:47.526 --> 00:04:48.563
(Laughter)

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:53.149
but also they're claiming fun,
fierce and frivolous art

00:04:53.173 --> 00:04:57.378
in the name of all things
unseriously African.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.532
Because we're AfroBubbleGumists

00:05:00.556 --> 00:05:03.409
and there's so many more of us
than you can imagine.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.114
Thank you so much.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.969
(Applause)
