00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.015
So in college,

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.913
I was a government major,

00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:19.399
which means I had to write
a lot of papers.

00:00:19.423 --> 00:00:21.471
Now, when a normal student writes a paper,

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:23.868
they might spread the work out
a little like this.

00:00:23.892 --> 00:00:25.043
So, you know --

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:26.724
(Laughter)

00:00:26.748 --> 00:00:28.575
you get started maybe a little slowly,

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.567
but you get enough done in the first week

00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:32.422
that, with some heavier days later on,

00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:34.603
everything gets done, things stay civil.

00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:35.829
(Laughter)

00:00:35.853 --> 00:00:38.124
And I would want to do that like that.

00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:39.342
That would be the plan.

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.856
I would have it all ready to go,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.374
but then, actually, the paper
would come along,

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:46.339
and then I would kind of do this.

00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:48.733
(Laughter)

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.900
And that would happen every single paper.

00:00:51.638 --> 00:00:55.520
But then came my 90-page senior thesis,

00:00:55.544 --> 00:00:57.831
a paper you're supposed
to spend a year on.

00:00:57.855 --> 00:01:01.474
And I knew for a paper like that,
my normal work flow was not an option.

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:02.899
It was way too big a project.

00:01:02.923 --> 00:01:04.076
So I planned things out,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.305
and I decided I kind of had
to go something like this.

00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:09.233
This is how the year would go.

00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:11.224
So I'd start off light,

00:01:11.248 --> 00:01:13.566
and I'd bump it up in the middle months,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.216
and then at the end,
I would kick it up into high gear

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.679
just like a little staircase.

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:19.765
How hard could it be
to walk up the stairs?

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:21.552
No big deal, right?

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.900
But then, the funniest thing happened.

00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:26.235
Those first few months?

00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:27.958
They came and went,

00:01:27.982 --> 00:01:29.567
and I couldn't quite do stuff.

00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:31.440
So we had an awesome new revised plan.

00:01:31.464 --> 00:01:32.631
(Laughter)

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:33.814
And then --

00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:35.720
(Laughter)

00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:38.528
But then those middle months
actually went by,

00:01:38.552 --> 00:01:40.734
and I didn't really write words,

00:01:40.758 --> 00:01:42.593
and so we were here.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.076
And then two months turned into one month,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.725
which turned into two weeks.

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.058
And one day I woke up

00:01:49.724 --> 00:01:52.343
with three days until the deadline,

00:01:53.502 --> 00:01:55.433
still not having written a word,

00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:57.516
and so I did the only thing I could:

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.147
I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:02.447
pulling not one but two all-nighters --

00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:05.040
humans are not supposed to pull
two all-nighters --

00:02:06.373 --> 00:02:08.366
sprinted across campus,

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.876
dove in slow motion,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.956
and got it in just at the deadline.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.004
I thought that was the end of everything.

00:02:14.028 --> 00:02:15.587
But a week later I get a call,

00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:17.097
and it's the school.

00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:19.396
And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?"

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.888
And I say, "Yeah."

00:02:20.912 --> 00:02:23.252
And they say, "We need
to talk about your thesis."

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.531
And I say, "OK."

00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:26.690
And they say,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.126
"It's the best one we've ever seen."

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.855
(Laughter)

00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:34.704
(Applause)

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:38.247
That did not happen.

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:40.409
(Laughter)

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:43.056
It was a very, very bad thesis.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.354
(Laughter)

00:02:45.378 --> 00:02:49.478
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment
when all of you thought,

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.407
"This guy is amazing!"

00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:52.779
(Laughter)

00:02:52.803 --> 00:02:54.470
No, no, it was very, very bad.

00:02:55.343 --> 00:02:58.751
Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.

00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:00.518
I write the blog Wait But Why.

00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:04.278
And a couple of years ago,
I decided to write about procrastination.

00:03:04.302 --> 00:03:07.586
My behavior has always perplexed
the non-procrastinators around me,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.298
and I wanted to explain
to the non-procrastinators of the world

00:03:11.322 --> 00:03:13.429
what goes on in the heads
of procrastinators,

00:03:13.453 --> 00:03:14.893
and why we are the way we are.

00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:16.073
Now, I had a hypothesis

00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:18.952
that the brains of procrastinators
were actually different

00:03:18.976 --> 00:03:20.933
than the brains of other people.

00:03:21.698 --> 00:03:23.889
And to test this, I found an MRI lab

00:03:23.913 --> 00:03:26.345
that actually let me scan both my brain

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:29.024
and the brain of a proven
non-procrastinator,

00:03:29.048 --> 00:03:30.483
so I could compare them.

00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:32.708
I actually brought them here
to show you today.

00:03:32.732 --> 00:03:36.269
I want you to take a look carefully
to see if you can notice a difference.

00:03:36.293 --> 00:03:38.607
I know that if you're not
a trained brain expert,

00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:40.894
it's not that obvious,
but just take a look, OK?

00:03:40.918 --> 00:03:43.046
So here's the brain
of a non-procrastinator.

00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:46.109
(Laughter)

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:47.284
Now ...

00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:49.639
here's my brain.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.006
(Laughter)

00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:57.277
There is a difference.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.292
Both brains have a Rational
Decision-Maker in them,

00:04:00.316 --> 00:04:01.968
but the procrastinator's brain

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:04.978
also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.

00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:07.304
Now, what does this mean
for the procrastinator?

00:04:07.328 --> 00:04:09.769
Well, it means everything's fine
until this happens.

00:04:09.793 --> 00:04:12.415
[This is a perfect time
to get some work done.] [Nope!]

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.372
So the Rational Decision-Maker
will make the rational decision

00:04:15.396 --> 00:04:17.292
to do something productive,

00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:19.266
but the Monkey doesn't like that plan,

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.798
so he actually takes the wheel,

00:04:20.822 --> 00:04:23.703
and he says, "Actually, let's read
the entire Wikipedia page

00:04:23.727 --> 00:04:25.863
of the Nancy Kerrigan/
Tonya Harding scandal,

00:04:25.887 --> 00:04:28.018
because I just remembered
that that happened.

00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:29.058
(Laughter)

00:04:29.082 --> 00:04:30.240
Then --

00:04:30.264 --> 00:04:31.527
(Laughter)

00:04:31.551 --> 00:04:33.589
Then we're going to go over to the fridge,

00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:36.479
to see if there's anything new
in there since 10 minutes ago.

00:04:36.503 --> 00:04:39.141
After that, we're going to go
on a YouTube spiral

00:04:39.165 --> 00:04:42.415
that starts with videos
of Richard Feynman talking about magnets

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.155
and ends much, much later
with us watching interviews

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:47.059
with Justin Bieber's mom.

00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:49.271
(Laughter)

00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:51.058
"All of that's going to take a while,

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:54.584
so we're not going to really have room
on the schedule for any work today.

00:04:54.608 --> 00:04:55.771
Sorry!"

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:56.960
(Sigh)

00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:01.694
Now, what is going on here?

00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:06.172
The Instant Gratification Monkey
does not seem like a guy

00:05:06.196 --> 00:05:07.450
you want behind the wheel.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.419
He lives entirely in the present moment.

00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:12.271
He has no memory of the past,
no knowledge of the future,

00:05:12.295 --> 00:05:13.992
and he only cares about two things:

00:05:14.016 --> 00:05:15.699
easy and fun.

00:05:16.338 --> 00:05:19.430
Now, in the animal world, that works fine.

00:05:19.454 --> 00:05:20.662
If you're a dog

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:24.257
and you spend your whole life doing
nothing other than easy and fun things,

00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:25.446
you're a huge success!

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.381
(Laughter)

00:05:27.405 --> 00:05:28.691
And to the Monkey,

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.063
humans are just another animal species.

00:05:32.087 --> 00:05:36.593
You have to keep well-slept, well-fed
and propagating into the next generation,

00:05:36.617 --> 00:05:38.903
which in tribal times
might have worked OK.

00:05:38.927 --> 00:05:41.777
But, if you haven't noticed,
now we're not in tribal times.

00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:45.934
We're in an advanced civilization,
and the Monkey does not know what that is.

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.239
Which is why we have
another guy in our brain,

00:05:48.263 --> 00:05:50.628
the Rational Decision-Maker,

00:05:50.652 --> 00:05:53.679
who gives us the ability to do things
no other animal can do.

00:05:53.703 --> 00:05:55.624
We can visualize the future.

00:05:55.648 --> 00:05:57.400
We can see the big picture.

00:05:57.424 --> 00:05:58.774
We can make long-term plans.

00:05:58.798 --> 00:06:01.281
And he wants to take
all of that into account.

00:06:02.138 --> 00:06:03.829
And he wants to just have us do

00:06:03.853 --> 00:06:06.801
whatever makes sense
to be doing right now.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.214
Now, sometimes it makes sense

00:06:08.238 --> 00:06:10.267
to be doing things that are easy and fun,

00:06:10.291 --> 00:06:12.442
like when you're having dinner
or going to bed

00:06:12.466 --> 00:06:14.294
or enjoying well-earned leisure time.

00:06:14.318 --> 00:06:15.768
That's why there's an overlap.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.536
Sometimes they agree.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.382
But other times, it makes much more sense

00:06:20.406 --> 00:06:24.008
to be doing things that are harder
and less pleasant,

00:06:24.032 --> 00:06:25.572
for the sake of the big picture.

00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:27.485
And that's when we have a conflict.

00:06:28.017 --> 00:06:29.332
And for the procrastinator,

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:31.865
that conflict tends to end
a certain way every time,

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.609
leaving him spending a lot of time
in this orange zone,

00:06:35.633 --> 00:06:39.960
an easy and fun place that's entirely
out of the Makes Sense circle.

00:06:39.984 --> 00:06:42.263
I call it the Dark Playground.

00:06:42.287 --> 00:06:43.911
(Laughter)

00:06:43.935 --> 00:06:47.063
Now, the Dark Playground is a place

00:06:47.087 --> 00:06:50.279
that all of you procrastinators
out there know very well.

00:06:50.892 --> 00:06:52.696
It's where leisure activities happen

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.030
at times when leisure activities
are not supposed to be happening.

00:06:56.418 --> 00:06:58.308
The fun you have in the Dark Playground

00:06:58.332 --> 00:07:00.815
isn't actually fun,
because it's completely unearned,

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:04.054
and the air is filled with guilt,
dread, anxiety, self-hatred --

00:07:04.078 --> 00:07:06.196
all of those good procrastinator feelings.

00:07:06.703 --> 00:07:10.179
And the question is, in this situation,
with the Monkey behind the wheel,

00:07:10.203 --> 00:07:13.796
how does the procrastinator ever get
himself over here to this blue zone,

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.101
a less pleasant place, but where
really important things happen?

00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:22.162
Well, turns out the procrastinator
has a guardian angel,

00:07:22.186 --> 00:07:25.394
someone who's always looking
down on him and watching over him

00:07:25.418 --> 00:07:26.848
in his darkest moments --

00:07:26.872 --> 00:07:28.967
someone called the Panic Monster.

00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:32.069
(Laughter)

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:39.246
Now, the Panic Monster
is dormant most of the time,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.172
but he suddenly wakes up
anytime a deadline gets too close

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:45.241
or there's danger of public embarrassment,

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:47.776
a career disaster or some other
scary consequence.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.972
And importantly, he's the only thing
the Monkey is terrified of.

00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:56.574
Now, he became very relevant
in my life pretty recently,

00:07:56.598 --> 00:07:59.844
because the people of TED
reached out to me about six months ago

00:07:59.868 --> 00:08:01.889
and invited me to do a TED Talk.

00:08:01.913 --> 00:08:04.341
(Laughter)

00:08:07.058 --> 00:08:08.965
Now, of course, I said yes.

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:12.794
It's always been a dream of mine
to have done a TED Talk in the past.

00:08:12.818 --> 00:08:16.790
(Laughter)

00:08:16.814 --> 00:08:20.511
(Applause)

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:26.172
But in the middle of all this excitement,

00:08:26.196 --> 00:08:29.497
the Rational Decision-Maker seemed
to have something else on his mind.

00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:32.069
He was saying, "Are we clear
on what we just accepted?

00:08:32.093 --> 00:08:35.342
Do we get what's going to be now
happening one day in the future?

00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:37.633
We need to sit down
and work on this right now."

00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:40.922
And the Monkey said, "Totally agree,
but let's just open Google Earth

00:08:40.946 --> 00:08:44.106
and zoom in to the bottom of India,
like 200 feet above the ground,

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.751
and scroll up for two and a half hours
til we get to the top of the country,

00:08:47.775 --> 00:08:49.753
so we can get a better feel for India."

00:08:49.777 --> 00:08:54.212
(Laughter)

00:08:55.149 --> 00:08:56.634
So that's what we did that day.

00:08:56.658 --> 00:08:59.328
(Laughter)

00:09:00.604 --> 00:09:04.500
As six months turned into four
and then two and then one,

00:09:04.524 --> 00:09:07.619
the people of TED decided
to release the speakers.

00:09:07.643 --> 00:09:10.255
And I opened up the website,
and there was my face

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:11.635
staring right back at me.

00:09:11.659 --> 00:09:13.259
And guess who woke up?

00:09:13.283 --> 00:09:16.398
(Laughter)

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.880
So the Panic Monster
starts losing his mind,

00:09:19.904 --> 00:09:22.650
and a few seconds later,
the whole system's in mayhem.

00:09:22.674 --> 00:09:25.120
(Laughter)

00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:30.612
And the Monkey -- remember,
he's terrified of the Panic Monster --

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:31.794
boom, he's up the tree!

00:09:31.818 --> 00:09:32.969
And finally,

00:09:32.993 --> 00:09:35.589
finally, the Rational Decision-Maker
can take the wheel

00:09:35.613 --> 00:09:37.331
and I can start working on the talk.

00:09:37.355 --> 00:09:39.643
Now, the Panic Monster explains

00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:43.148
all kinds of pretty insane
procrastinator behavior,

00:09:43.172 --> 00:09:45.506
like how someone like me
could spend two weeks

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.374
unable to start the opening
sentence of a paper,

00:09:49.398 --> 00:09:52.169
and then miraculously find
the unbelievable work ethic

00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:55.289
to stay up all night
and write eight pages.

00:09:56.385 --> 00:09:59.367
And this entire situation,
with the three characters --

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.411
this is the procrastinator's system.

00:10:02.096 --> 00:10:05.521
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.

00:10:05.545 --> 00:10:09.607
This is what I decided to write about
on the blog a couple of years ago.

00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:12.602
When I did, I was amazed by the response.

00:10:12.626 --> 00:10:14.779
Literally thousands of emails came in,

00:10:14.803 --> 00:10:17.580
from all different kinds of people
from all over the world,

00:10:17.604 --> 00:10:19.342
doing all different kinds of things.

00:10:19.366 --> 00:10:22.332
These are people who were nurses,
bankers, painters, engineers

00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:24.678
and lots and lots of PhD students.

00:10:24.702 --> 00:10:26.703
(Laughter)

00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:29.015
And they were all writing,
saying the same thing:

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:30.991
"I have this problem too."

00:10:31.015 --> 00:10:34.844
But what struck me was the contrast
between the light tone of the post

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:36.963
and the heaviness of these emails.

00:10:36.987 --> 00:10:40.070
These people were writing
with intense frustration

00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:42.856
about what procrastination
had done to their lives,

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.910
about what this Monkey had done to them.

00:10:46.902 --> 00:10:49.868
And I thought about this, and I said,

00:10:49.892 --> 00:10:53.004
well, if the procrastinator's system
works, then what's going on?

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:55.514
Why are all of these people
in such a dark place?

00:10:55.538 --> 00:10:58.836
Well, it turns out that there's
two kinds of procrastination.

00:10:59.987 --> 00:11:02.821
Everything I've talked about today,
the examples I've given,

00:11:02.845 --> 00:11:03.996
they all have deadlines.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.318
And when there's deadlines,

00:11:05.342 --> 00:11:08.267
the effects of procrastination
are contained to the short term

00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:10.204
because the Panic Monster gets involved.

00:11:10.228 --> 00:11:12.282
But there's a second kind
of procrastination

00:11:12.306 --> 00:11:14.793
that happens in situations
when there is no deadline.

00:11:14.817 --> 00:11:17.507
So if you wanted a career
where you're a self-starter --

00:11:17.531 --> 00:11:19.944
something in the arts,
something entrepreneurial --

00:11:19.968 --> 00:11:23.493
there's no deadlines on those things
at first, because nothing's happening,

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:25.761
not until you've gone out
and done the hard work

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:27.411
to get momentum, get things going.

00:11:27.435 --> 00:11:30.513
There's also all kinds of important things
outside of your career

00:11:30.537 --> 00:11:32.142
that don't involve any deadlines,

00:11:32.166 --> 00:11:35.431
like seeing your family or exercising
and taking care of your health,

00:11:35.455 --> 00:11:36.859
working on your relationship

00:11:36.883 --> 00:11:39.564
or getting out of a relationship
that isn't working.

00:11:39.588 --> 00:11:44.736
Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism
of doing these hard things

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.645
is the Panic Monster, that's a problem,

00:11:46.669 --> 00:11:49.469
because in all of these
non-deadline situations,

00:11:49.493 --> 00:11:51.121
the Panic Monster doesn't show up.

00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:52.597
He has nothing to wake up for,

00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:55.319
so the effects of procrastination,
they're not contained;

00:11:55.343 --> 00:11:57.083
they just extend outward forever.

00:11:57.953 --> 00:12:00.693
And it's this long-term
kind of procrastination

00:12:00.717 --> 00:12:03.798
that's much less visible
and much less talked about

00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:06.723
than the funnier, short-term
deadline-based kind.

00:12:06.747 --> 00:12:09.850
It's usually suffered
quietly and privately.

00:12:10.816 --> 00:12:11.970
And it can be the source

00:12:11.994 --> 00:12:15.729
of a huge amount of long-term
unhappiness, and regrets.

00:12:16.576 --> 00:12:19.448
And I thought, that's why
those people are emailing,

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:21.974
and that's why they're
in such a bad place.

00:12:21.998 --> 00:12:24.742
It's not that they're cramming
for some project.

00:12:24.766 --> 00:12:28.187
It's that long-term procrastination
has made them feel like a spectator,

00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:30.250
at times, in their own lives.

00:12:30.594 --> 00:12:33.576
The frustration is not
that they couldn't achieve their dreams;

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.689
it's that they weren't even
able to start chasing them.

00:12:36.713 --> 00:12:40.896
So I read these emails
and I had a little bit of an epiphany --

00:12:42.182 --> 00:12:45.582
that I don't think
non-procrastinators exist.

00:12:45.979 --> 00:12:49.215
That's right -- I think all of you
are procrastinators.

00:12:49.898 --> 00:12:51.812
Now, you might not all be a mess,

00:12:51.836 --> 00:12:53.186
like some of us,

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.739
(Laughter)

00:12:54.763 --> 00:12:58.079
and some of you may have
a healthy relationship with deadlines,

00:12:58.103 --> 00:13:00.627
but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick

00:13:00.651 --> 00:13:02.491
is when the deadlines aren't there.

00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:05.281
Now, I want to show you one last thing.

00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:07.678
I call this a Life Calendar.

00:13:08.352 --> 00:13:12.631
That's one box for every week
of a 90-year life.

00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:14.934
That's not that many boxes,

00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.932
especially since we've already
used a bunch of those.

00:13:18.607 --> 00:13:23.739
So I think we need to all take a long,
hard look at that calendar.

00:13:24.977 --> 00:13:27.990
We need to think about what
we're really procrastinating on,

00:13:28.014 --> 00:13:31.379
because everyone is procrastinating
on something in life.

00:13:32.782 --> 00:13:35.812
We need to stay aware
of the Instant Gratification Monkey.

00:13:37.455 --> 00:13:39.947
That's a job for all of us.

00:13:40.669 --> 00:13:42.969
And because there's not
that many boxes on there,

00:13:42.993 --> 00:13:45.283
it's a job that should
probably start today.

00:13:45.307 --> 00:13:48.307
Well, maybe not today, but ...

00:13:48.331 --> 00:13:49.972
(Laughter)

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.146
You know.

00:13:51.576 --> 00:13:52.726
Sometime soon.

00:13:53.393 --> 00:13:54.602
Thank you.

00:13:54.626 --> 00:14:02.624
(Applause)
