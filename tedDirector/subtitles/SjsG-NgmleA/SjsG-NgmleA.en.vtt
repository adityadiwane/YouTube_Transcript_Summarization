00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:15.049
Today I am going to teach you

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.809
how to play my favorite game:

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.292
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.

00:00:22.292 --> 00:00:25.612
It's the only game in the world that I know of

00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:27.679
that allows you, the player,

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.098
the opportunity to experience

00:00:30.098 --> 00:00:34.486
10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less.

00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:36.998
This is true, so if you play this game with me today

00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:39.001
for just one single minute,

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.701
you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise,

00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:45.767
pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder,

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:47.365
contentment, and creativity,

00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:48.904
all in the span of one minute.

00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:51.236
So this sounds pretty good, right?
Now you're willing to play.

00:00:51.236 --> 00:00:52.799
In order to teach you this game,

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.172
I'm going to need some volunteers

00:00:54.172 --> 00:00:56.075
to come up onstage really quickly,

00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:57.553
and we're going to do a little hands-on demo.

00:00:57.553 --> 00:00:59.594
While they're coming up, I should let you know,

00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:02.056
this game was invented 10 years ago

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:05.353
by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom.

00:01:05.353 --> 00:01:07.098
So thank you, Monochrom.

00:01:07.098 --> 00:01:09.141
Okay, so most people are familiar

00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:11.133
with traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.721
Sunni, let's just remind them.

00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:15.507
One, two, three, four, 
I declare a thumb war, and we wrestle,

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:17.607
and of course Sunni beats me
because she's the best.

00:01:17.607 --> 00:01:21.411
Now the first thing about
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,

00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:22.822
we're the gamer generation.

00:01:22.822 --> 00:01:25.173
There are a billion gamers on the planet now,

00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:26.727
so we need more of a challenge.

00:01:26.727 --> 00:01:30.106
So the first thing we need is more thumbs.

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:31.800
So Eric, come on over.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.611
So we could get three thumbs together,

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:37.069
and Peter could join us.

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.789
We could even have four thumbs together,

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.316
and the way you win

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:43.513
is you're the first person
to pin someone else's thumb.

00:01:43.513 --> 00:01:45.371
This is really important. You can't, like,

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.908
wait while they fight it out and
then swoop in at the last minute.

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:49.403
That is not how you win.

00:01:49.403 --> 00:01:50.738
Ah, who did that? Eric you did that.

00:01:50.738 --> 00:01:53.540
So Eric would have won. He was
the first person to pin my thumb.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.950
Okay, so that's the first rule,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.809
and we can see that three or four

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:59.988
is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node,

00:01:59.988 --> 00:02:02.630
but if you feel ambitious,
you don't have to hold back.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.995
We can really go for it.

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:06.161
So you can see up here.

00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:09.133
Now the only other rule you need to remember is,

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:11.400
gamer generation, we like a challenge.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.047
I happen to notice you all have

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:14.883
some thumbs you're not using.

00:02:14.883 --> 00:02:17.890
So I think we should kind of get some more involved.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.660
And if we had just four people,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.498
we would do it just like this,

00:02:21.498 --> 00:02:23.184
and we would try and wrestle

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:24.965
both thumbs at the same time.

00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:26.272
Perfect.

00:02:26.272 --> 00:02:28.386
Now, if we had more people in the room,

00:02:28.386 --> 00:02:30.265
instead of just wrestling in a closed node,

00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:33.048
we might reach out and try
and grab some other people.

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:34.769
And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now.

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.321
We're going to try and get all, something like,

00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:40.297
I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room

00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:41.610
connected in a single node.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.650
And we have to connect both levels,

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.096
so if you're up there, you're going to be

00:02:47.096 --> 00:02:49.309
reaching down and reaching up.

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:50.983
Now — (Laughter) —

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:52.875
before we get started --

00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:55.908
This is great. You're excited to play. —

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:58.988
before we get started, can I have
the slides back up here really quick,

00:02:58.988 --> 00:03:00.945
because if you get good at this game,

00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:03.581
I want you to know there are some advanced levels.

00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:06.493
So this is the kind of simple level, right?

00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:08.405
But there are advanced configurations.

00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:10.415
This is called the Death Star Configuration.

00:03:10.415 --> 00:03:12.122
Any Star Wars fans?

00:03:12.122 --> 00:03:14.470
And this one's called the Möbius Strip.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.290
Any science geeks, you get that one.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.194
This is the hardest level. This is the extreme.

00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:21.208
So we'll stick with the normal one for now,

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.150
and I'm going to give you 30 seconds,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.175
every thumb into the node,

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:26.648
connect the upper and the lower levels,

00:03:26.648 --> 00:03:28.150
you guys go on down there.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.326
Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node.

00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:35.932
Stand up! It's easier if you stand up.

00:03:35.932 --> 00:03:39.871
Everybody, up up up up up!

00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:42.635
Stand up, my friends.

00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:44.193
All right.

00:03:44.193 --> 00:03:47.001
Don't start wrestling yet.

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:49.781
If you have a free thumb, wave it around,

00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:53.002
make sure it gets connected.

00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:55.694
Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check.

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:59.027
If you have a free thumb,
wave it around to make sure.

00:03:59.027 --> 00:04:00.520
Grab that thumb!

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.863
Reach behind you. There you go.

00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:03.421
Any other thumbs?

00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:05.936
Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go.

00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:08.649
Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it.

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:11.179
Okay? One, two, three, go!

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:15.268
(Laughter)

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.532
Did you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent!

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:24.049
(Applause)

00:04:24.049 --> 00:04:27.591
Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:04:27.591 --> 00:04:28.996
All right.

00:04:28.996 --> 00:04:32.408
While you are basking in the glow

00:04:32.408 --> 00:04:34.210
of having won your first

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.825
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game,

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:38.415
let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions.

00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:40.354
So curiosity.

00:04:40.354 --> 00:04:42.326
I said "massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling."

00:04:42.326 --> 00:04:44.126
You were like, "What the hell is she talking about?"

00:04:44.126 --> 00:04:46.003
So I provoked a little curiosity.

00:04:46.003 --> 00:04:48.672
Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem

00:04:48.672 --> 00:04:50.031
of getting all the thumbs into the node.

00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:51.444
I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up.

00:04:51.444 --> 00:04:52.998
So you used creativity. That was great.

00:04:52.998 --> 00:04:55.250
How about surprise? The actual feeling

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.912
of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once
is pretty surprising.

00:04:57.912 --> 00:04:59.772
You heard that sound go up in the room.

00:04:59.772 --> 00:05:01.611
We had excitement. As you started to wrestle,

00:05:01.611 --> 00:05:03.816
maybe you're starting to win
or this person's, like, really into it,

00:05:03.816 --> 00:05:06.302
so you kind of get the excitement going.

00:05:06.302 --> 00:05:08.245
We have relief. You got to stand up.

00:05:08.245 --> 00:05:10.003
You've been sitting for awhile, so the physical relief,

00:05:10.003 --> 00:05:11.320
getting to shake it out.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.880
We had joy. You were laughing, smiling.
Look at your faces. This room is full of joy.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.840
We had some contentment.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.529
I didn't see anybody sending text messages
or checking their email while we were playing,

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.522
so you were totally content to be playing.

00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:25.210
The most important three emotions,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.822
awe and wonder, we had everybody
connected physically for a minute.

00:05:28.822 --> 00:05:30.421
When was the last time you were at TED

00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:33.250
and you got to connect physically
with every single person in the room?

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.896
And it's truly awesome and wondrous.

00:05:34.896 --> 00:05:36.740
And speaking of physical connection,

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.743
you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin,

00:05:39.743 --> 00:05:42.920
you release oxytocin, you feel bonded
to everyone in the room.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.436
You guys know that the best way
to release oxytocin quickly

00:05:45.436 --> 00:05:47.935
is to hold someone else's hand
for at least six seconds.

00:05:47.935 --> 00:05:50.487
You guys were all holding hands
for way more than six seconds,

00:05:50.487 --> 00:05:52.267
so we are all now biochemically primed

00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:54.120
to love each other. That is great.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.044
And the last emotion of pride.

00:05:57.044 --> 00:05:59.848
How many people are like me. Just admit it.

00:05:59.848 --> 00:06:00.994
You lost both your thumbs.

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:02.943
It just didn't work out for you.

00:06:02.943 --> 00:06:05.506
That's okay, because you learned a new skill today.

00:06:05.506 --> 00:06:08.270
You learned, from scratch,
a game you never knew before.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.976
Now you know how to play it.
You can teach other people.

00:06:09.976 --> 00:06:11.544
So congratulations.

00:06:11.544 --> 00:06:13.865
How many of you won just won thumb?

00:06:13.865 --> 00:06:15.236
All right. I have very good news for you.

00:06:15.236 --> 00:06:16.368
According to the official rules

00:06:16.368 --> 00:06:18.364
of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,

00:06:18.364 --> 00:06:22.145
this makes you a grandmaster of the game.

00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:24.377
Because there aren't that many
people who know how to play,

00:06:24.377 --> 00:06:26.576
we have to kind of accelerate the program

00:06:26.576 --> 00:06:28.169
more than a game like chess.

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:29.962
So congratulations, grandmasters.

00:06:29.962 --> 00:06:32.453
Win one thumb once, you will
become a grandmaster.

00:06:32.453 --> 00:06:34.482
Did anybody win both their thumbs?

00:06:34.482 --> 00:06:35.981
Yes. Awesome. Okay.

00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:38.904
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status.

00:06:38.904 --> 00:06:40.670
You guys, according to the rules,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.346
are legendary grandmasters, so congratulations.

00:06:44.346 --> 00:06:47.075
I will just leave you with this tip,
if you want to play again.

00:06:47.075 --> 00:06:48.863
The best way to become a legendary grandmaster,

00:06:48.863 --> 00:06:50.949
you've got your two nodes going on.

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:52.671
Pick off the one that looks easiest.

00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:54.652
They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak.

00:06:54.652 --> 00:06:56.736
Focus on that one and do something crazy

00:06:56.736 --> 00:06:58.072
with this arm.

00:06:58.072 --> 00:07:00.401
As soon as you win, suddenly stop.

00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:02.201
Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill.

00:07:02.201 --> 00:07:04.767
That's how you become a legendary grandmaster
of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.

00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:07.294
Thank you for letting me
teach you my favorite game.

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:09.130
Wooo! (Applause)

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.210
Thank you. (Applause)
