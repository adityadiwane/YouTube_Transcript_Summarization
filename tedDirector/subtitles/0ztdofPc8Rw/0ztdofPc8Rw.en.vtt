00:00:12.902 --> 00:00:16.985
I come to you today to speak of liars,

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.432
lawsuits

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:19.796
and laughter.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.840
The first time I heard
about Holocaust denial,

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:25.166
I laughed.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.542
Holocaust denial?

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.437
The Holocaust which has
the dubious distinction

00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:35.956
of being the best-documented
genocide in the world?

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.892
Who could believe it didn't happen?

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:41.273
Think about it.

00:00:42.077 --> 00:00:44.358
For deniers to be right,

00:00:44.382 --> 00:00:46.278
who would have to be wrong?

00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:49.597
Well, first of all, the victims --

00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:54.338
the survivors who have told us
their harrowing stories.

00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:57.855
Who else would have to be wrong?

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.832
The bystanders.

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:03.834
The people who lived in the myriads
of towns and villages and cities

00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:05.830
on the Eastern front,

00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:08.296
who watched their neighbors
be rounded up --

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.533
men, women, children, young, old --

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:14.277
and be marched
to the outskirts of the town

00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:17.293
to be shot and left dead in ditches.

00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:19.135
Or the Poles,

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.840
who lived in towns and villages
around the death camps,

00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:26.240
who watched day after day

00:01:26.264 --> 00:01:29.006
as the trains went in filled with people

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.553
and came out empty.

00:01:31.607 --> 00:01:35.240
But above all, who would have to be wrong?

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:37.289
The perpetrators.

00:01:37.932 --> 00:01:40.838
The people who say, "We did it.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.823
I did it."

00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:44.996
Now, maybe they add a caveat.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.444
They say, "I didn't have a choice;
I was forced to do it."

00:01:49.924 --> 00:01:52.593
But nonetheless, they say, "I did it."

00:01:53.758 --> 00:01:55.309
Think about it.

00:01:55.333 --> 00:02:01.272
In not one war crimes trial
since the end of World War II

00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:07.932
has a perpetrator of any nationality
ever said, "It didn't happen."

00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:13.480
Again, they may have said, "I was forced,"
but never that it didn't happen.

00:02:13.504 --> 00:02:14.978
Having thought that through,

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:18.953
I decided denial was not
going to be on my agenda;

00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:22.685
I had bigger things to worry about,
to write about, to research,

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.023
and I moved on.

00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:27.550
Fast-forward a little over a decade,

00:02:27.574 --> 00:02:29.386
and two senior scholars --

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.568
two of the most prominent historians
of the Holocaust --

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:33.849
approached me and said,

00:02:33.873 --> 00:02:35.662
"Deborah, let's have coffee.

00:02:35.686 --> 00:02:39.283
We have a research idea
that we think is perfect for you."

00:02:39.307 --> 00:02:43.140
Intrigued and flattered
that they came to me with an idea

00:02:43.164 --> 00:02:44.741
and thought me worthy of it,

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:46.861
I asked, "What is it?"

00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:50.474
And they said, "Holocaust denial."

00:02:51.173 --> 00:02:53.668
And for the second time, I laughed.

00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:56.080
Holocaust denial?

00:02:56.104 --> 00:02:58.090
The Flat Earth folks?

00:02:58.114 --> 00:03:00.251
The Elvis-is-alive people?

00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:02.463
I should study them?

00:03:03.146 --> 00:03:04.463
And these two guys said,

00:03:04.487 --> 00:03:06.420
"Yeah, we're intrigued.

00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:08.404
What are they about?

00:03:08.428 --> 00:03:10.178
What's their objective?

00:03:10.202 --> 00:03:13.856
How do they manage to get people
to believe what they say?"

00:03:14.576 --> 00:03:18.104
So thinking, if they thought
it was worthwhile,

00:03:18.128 --> 00:03:21.502
I would take a momentary diversion --

00:03:21.526 --> 00:03:24.464
maybe a year, maybe two,
three, maybe even four --

00:03:24.488 --> 00:03:26.733
in academic terms, that's momentary.

00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:27.899
(Laughter)

00:03:27.923 --> 00:03:30.310
We work very slowly.

00:03:30.334 --> 00:03:31.906
(Laughter)

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.732
And I would look at them.

00:03:33.756 --> 00:03:34.911
So I did.

00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:37.774
I did my research, and I came up
with a number of things,

00:03:37.798 --> 00:03:40.391
two of which I'd like to share
with you today.

00:03:40.415 --> 00:03:41.748
One:

00:03:41.772 --> 00:03:46.729
deniers are wolves in sheep's clothing.

00:03:47.532 --> 00:03:50.497
They are the same: Nazis, neo-Nazis --

00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:53.748
you can decide whether you want
to put a "neo" there or not.

00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:56.939
But when I looked at them,

00:03:56.963 --> 00:04:01.689
I didn't see any SS-like uniforms,

00:04:01.713 --> 00:04:04.864
swastika-like symbols on the wall,

00:04:04.888 --> 00:04:06.945
Sieg Heil salutes --

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:08.513
none of that.

00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:11.407
What I found instead

00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:16.046
were people parading
as respectable academics.

00:04:16.736 --> 00:04:17.957
What did they have?

00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:19.679
They had an institute.

00:04:19.703 --> 00:04:23.547
An "Institute for Historical Review."

00:04:24.212 --> 00:04:26.766
They had a journal -- a slick journal --

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.744
a "Journal of Historical Review."

00:04:30.218 --> 00:04:32.924
One filled with papers --

00:04:32.948 --> 00:04:34.992
footnote-laden papers.

00:04:35.743 --> 00:04:37.683
And they had a new name.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.488
Not neo-Nazis,

00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:43.002
not anti-Semites --

00:04:43.026 --> 00:04:44.284
revisionists.

00:04:44.811 --> 00:04:47.026
They said, "We are revisionists.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.733
We are out to do one thing:

00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:53.317
to revise mistakes in history."

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:59.599
But all you had to do was go
one inch below the surface,

00:04:59.623 --> 00:05:01.530
and what did you find there?

00:05:01.554 --> 00:05:04.044
The same adulation of Hitler,

00:05:04.068 --> 00:05:05.943
praise of the Third Reich,

00:05:05.967 --> 00:05:08.909
anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice.

00:05:09.724 --> 00:05:12.170
This is what intrigued me.

00:05:12.194 --> 00:05:19.191
It was anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice,
parading as rational discourse.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.137
The other thing I found --

00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:25.906
many of us have been taught to think
there are facts and there are opinions --

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.386
after studying deniers,

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.746
I think differently.

00:05:29.258 --> 00:05:30.906
There are facts,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.644
there are opinions,

00:05:32.668 --> 00:05:34.280
and there are lies.

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:39.395
And what deniers want to do
is take their lies,

00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:42.017
dress them up as opinions --

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.031
maybe edgy opinions,

00:05:44.055 --> 00:05:46.764
maybe sort of out-of-the-box opinions --

00:05:46.788 --> 00:05:48.172
but then if they're opinions,

00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:50.328
they should be part of the conversation.

00:05:50.352 --> 00:05:53.745
And then they encroach on the facts.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:56.688
I published my work --

00:05:56.712 --> 00:05:57.886
the book was published,

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.312
"Denying the Holocaust: The Growing
Assault on Truth and Memory,"

00:06:01.336 --> 00:06:03.292
it came out in many different countries,

00:06:03.316 --> 00:06:05.476
including here in Penguin UK,

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.930
and I was done with those folks
and ready to move on.

00:06:09.983 --> 00:06:13.691
Then came the letter from Penguin UK.

00:06:14.254 --> 00:06:17.022
And for the third time, I laughed ...

00:06:18.908 --> 00:06:20.148
mistakenly.

00:06:20.792 --> 00:06:22.522
I opened the letter,

00:06:22.546 --> 00:06:28.434
and it informed me that David Irving
was bringing a libel suit against me

00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:30.055
in the United Kingdom

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:33.115
for calling him a Holocaust denier.

00:06:33.773 --> 00:06:35.707
David Irving suing me?

00:06:35.731 --> 00:06:36.935
Who was David Irving?

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:39.566
David Irving was a writer
of historical works,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.613
most of them about World War II,

00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:44.856
and virtually all of those works
took the position

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.458
that the Nazis were really not so bad,

00:06:48.482 --> 00:06:51.566
and the Allies were really not so good.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.695
And the Jews, whatever happened to them,

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:55.029
they sort of deserved it.

00:06:56.026 --> 00:06:57.517
He knew the documents,

00:06:57.541 --> 00:06:58.984
he knew the facts,

00:06:59.008 --> 00:07:02.180
but he somehow twisted them
to get this opinion.

00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:05.348
He hadn't always been a Holocaust denier,

00:07:05.372 --> 00:07:07.113
but in the late '80s,

00:07:07.137 --> 00:07:09.564
he embraced it with great vigor.

00:07:11.337 --> 00:07:15.242
The reason I laughed also
was this was a man

00:07:15.266 --> 00:07:17.200
who not only was a Holocaust denier,

00:07:17.224 --> 00:07:18.919
but seemed quite proud of it.

00:07:18.943 --> 00:07:20.567
Here was a man -- and I quote --

00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:24.285
who said, "I'm going to sink
the battleship Auschwitz."

00:07:25.165 --> 00:07:26.337
Here was a man

00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:30.381
who pointed to the number tattooed
on a survivor's arm and said,

00:07:31.536 --> 00:07:33.128
"How much money have you made

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:36.552
from having that number
tattooed on your arm?"

00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:39.277
Here was a man who said,

00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:42.257
"More people died in Senator Kennedy's car

00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:43.593
at Chappaquiddick

00:07:43.617 --> 00:07:46.931
than died in gas chambers at Auschwitz."

00:07:46.955 --> 00:07:49.792
That's an American reference,
but you can look it up.

00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:54.240
This was not a man who seemed
at all ashamed or reticent

00:07:54.264 --> 00:07:56.333
about being a Holocaust denier.

00:07:56.956 --> 00:08:00.736
Now, lots of my academic
colleagues counseled me --

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.666
"Eh, Deborah, just ignore it."

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.278
When I explained you can't just
ignore a libel suit,

00:08:06.302 --> 00:08:09.084
they said, "Who's going to
believe him anyway?"

00:08:09.603 --> 00:08:11.683
But here was the problem:

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:17.015
British law put the onus,
put the burden of proof on me

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:19.721
to prove the truth of what I said,

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:22.508
in contrast to as it would have
been in the United States

00:08:22.532 --> 00:08:24.036
and in many other countries:

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.066
on him to prove the falsehood.

00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:29.202
What did that mean?

00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:32.602
That meant if I didn't fight,

00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:35.052
he would win by default.

00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:37.366
And if he won by default,

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.031
he could then legitimately say,

00:08:40.055 --> 00:08:45.391
"My David Irving version of the Holocaust
is a legitimate version.

00:08:45.415 --> 00:08:47.599
Deborah Lipstadt was found
to have libeled me

00:08:47.623 --> 00:08:49.570
when she called me a Holocaust denier.

00:08:49.594 --> 00:08:54.022
Ipso facto, I, David Irving,
am not a Holocaust denier."

00:08:54.046 --> 00:08:55.758
And what is that version?

00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:59.247
There was no plan to murder the Jews,

00:08:59.271 --> 00:09:01.323
there were no gas chambers,

00:09:01.347 --> 00:09:03.203
there were no mass shootings,

00:09:03.227 --> 00:09:06.398
Hitler had nothing to do
with any suffering that went on,

00:09:06.422 --> 00:09:10.227
and the Jews have made this all up

00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:12.649
to get money from Germany

00:09:12.673 --> 00:09:14.380
and to get a state,

00:09:14.404 --> 00:09:17.781
and they've done it with the aid
and abettance of the Allies --

00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:21.270
they've planted the documents
and planted the evidence.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.660
I couldn't let that stand

00:09:24.684 --> 00:09:26.884
and ever face a survivor

00:09:27.643 --> 00:09:29.618
or a child of survivors.

00:09:29.642 --> 00:09:31.794
I couldn't let that stand

00:09:31.818 --> 00:09:36.069
and consider myself
a responsible historian.

00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:38.752
So we fought.

00:09:38.776 --> 00:09:41.058
And for those of you
who haven't seen "Denial,"

00:09:41.082 --> 00:09:42.241
spoiler alert:

00:09:42.265 --> 00:09:43.483
we won.

00:09:43.507 --> 00:09:44.802
(Laughter)

00:09:44.826 --> 00:09:47.393
(Applause)

00:09:51.808 --> 00:09:56.049
The judge found David Irving

00:09:56.073 --> 00:09:59.404
to be a liar,

00:09:59.428 --> 00:10:00.591
a racist,

00:10:00.615 --> 00:10:01.869
an anti-Semite.

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:04.253
His view of history was tendentious,

00:10:04.277 --> 00:10:06.203
he lied, he distorted --

00:10:06.227 --> 00:10:08.870
and most importantly,

00:10:08.894 --> 00:10:11.007
he did it deliberately.

00:10:11.031 --> 00:10:15.170
We showed a pattern,
in over 25 different major instances.

00:10:15.194 --> 00:10:18.304
Not small things -- many of us
in this audience write books,

00:10:18.328 --> 00:10:19.513
are writing books;

00:10:19.537 --> 00:10:23.003
we always make mistakes, that's why
we're glad to have second editions:

00:10:23.027 --> 00:10:24.213
correct the mistakes.

00:10:24.237 --> 00:10:25.387
(Laughter)

00:10:26.454 --> 00:10:29.590
But these always moved
in the same direction:

00:10:30.438 --> 00:10:32.649
blame the Jews,

00:10:32.673 --> 00:10:34.848
exonerate the Nazis.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.104
But how did we win?

00:10:38.016 --> 00:10:43.396
What we did is follow his footnotes
back to his sources.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.793
And what did we find?

00:10:45.817 --> 00:10:47.296
Not in most cases,

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.288
and not in the preponderance of cases,

00:10:49.312 --> 00:10:53.623
but in every single instance where
he made some reference to the Holocaust,

00:10:53.647 --> 00:10:57.889
that his supposed evidence was distorted,

00:10:57.913 --> 00:10:59.333
half-truth,

00:10:59.357 --> 00:11:00.691
date-changed,

00:11:00.715 --> 00:11:02.902
sequence-changed,

00:11:02.926 --> 00:11:05.050
someone put at a meeting who wasn't there.

00:11:05.074 --> 00:11:07.835
In other words,
he didn't have the evidence.

00:11:07.859 --> 00:11:09.968
His evidence didn't prove it.

00:11:09.992 --> 00:11:12.651
We didn't prove what happened.

00:11:13.448 --> 00:11:15.947
We proved that what he said happened --

00:11:15.971 --> 00:11:18.831
and by extension, all deniers,
because he either quotes them

00:11:18.855 --> 00:11:21.326
or they get their arguments from him --

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.596
is not true.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.809
What they claim --

00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:26.455
they don't have the evidence to prove it.

00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:33.173
So why is my story
more than just the story

00:11:33.197 --> 00:11:37.004
of a quirky, long,
six-year, difficult lawsuit,

00:11:37.028 --> 00:11:42.017
an American professor
being dragged into a courtroom

00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:45.085
by a man that the court
declared in its judgment

00:11:45.109 --> 00:11:47.359
was a neo-Nazi polemicist?

00:11:47.383 --> 00:11:49.166
What message does it have?

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.593
I think in the context
of the question of truth,

00:11:52.617 --> 00:11:55.079
it has a very significant message.

00:11:55.103 --> 00:11:56.888
Because today,

00:11:56.912 --> 00:11:58.578
as we well know,

00:11:58.602 --> 00:12:02.718
truth and facts are under assault.

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:06.774
Social media, for all
the gifts it has given us,

00:12:06.798 --> 00:12:12.379
has also allowed the difference
between facts -- established facts --

00:12:12.403 --> 00:12:14.160
and lies

00:12:14.184 --> 00:12:15.582
to be flattened.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.320
Third of all:

00:12:18.344 --> 00:12:19.815
extremism.

00:12:20.807 --> 00:12:24.384
You may not see Ku Klux Klan robes,

00:12:24.408 --> 00:12:26.479
you may not see burning crosses,

00:12:26.503 --> 00:12:30.822
you may not even hear outright
white supremacist language.

00:12:30.846 --> 00:12:35.752
It may go by names: "alt-right,"
"National Front" -- pick your names.

00:12:35.776 --> 00:12:41.611
But underneath, it's that same extremism
that I found in Holocaust denial

00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:45.029
parading as rational discourse.

00:12:46.954 --> 00:12:52.171
We live in an age
where truth is on the defensive.

00:12:52.195 --> 00:12:54.679
I'm reminded of a New Yorker cartoon.

00:12:54.703 --> 00:12:57.223
A quiz show recently appeared
in "The New Yorker"

00:12:57.247 --> 00:13:00.469
where the host of the quiz show
is saying to one of the contestants,

00:13:00.493 --> 00:13:02.802
"Yes, ma'am, you had the right answer.

00:13:02.826 --> 00:13:05.319
But your opponent yelled
more loudly than you did,

00:13:05.343 --> 00:13:06.868
so he gets the point."

00:13:08.048 --> 00:13:09.555
What can we do?

00:13:10.377 --> 00:13:11.754
First of all,

00:13:11.778 --> 00:13:17.209
we cannot be beguiled
by rational appearances.

00:13:17.233 --> 00:13:19.002
We've got to look underneath,

00:13:19.026 --> 00:13:21.827
and we will find there the extremism.

00:13:22.811 --> 00:13:24.797
Second of all,

00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:30.902
we must understand
that truth is not relative.

00:13:32.957 --> 00:13:34.421
Number three,

00:13:34.445 --> 00:13:38.134
we must go on the offensive,

00:13:38.158 --> 00:13:39.931
not the defensive.

00:13:40.496 --> 00:13:43.103
When someone makes an outrageous claim,

00:13:43.127 --> 00:13:46.631
even though they may hold
one of the highest offices in the land,

00:13:46.655 --> 00:13:48.666
if not the world --

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.200
we must say to them,

00:13:50.224 --> 00:13:52.190
"Where's the proof?

00:13:52.214 --> 00:13:54.351
Where's the evidence?"

00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:57.302
We must hold their feet to the fire.

00:13:57.326 --> 00:14:01.932
We must not treat it as if their lies
are the same as the facts.

00:14:03.215 --> 00:14:06.755
And as I said earlier,
truth is not relative.

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:09.635
Many of us have grown up
in the world of the academy

00:14:09.659 --> 00:14:11.400
and enlightened liberal thought,

00:14:11.424 --> 00:14:14.385
where we're taught
everything is open to debate.

00:14:14.984 --> 00:14:16.998
But that's not the case.

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:20.464
There are certain things that are true.

00:14:21.012 --> 00:14:24.032
There are indisputable facts --

00:14:24.056 --> 00:14:25.746
objective truths.

00:14:26.339 --> 00:14:31.156
Galileo taught it to us centuries ago.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.847
Even after being forced
to recant by the Vatican

00:14:35.871 --> 00:14:38.444
that the Earth moved around the Sun,

00:14:38.468 --> 00:14:39.622
he came out,

00:14:39.646 --> 00:14:41.956
and what is he reported to have said?

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.802
"And yet, it still moves."

00:14:47.162 --> 00:14:50.002
The Earth is not flat.

00:14:50.026 --> 00:14:52.316
The climate is changing.

00:14:53.207 --> 00:14:55.475
Elvis is not alive.

00:14:55.499 --> 00:14:57.034
(Laughter)

00:14:57.058 --> 00:14:59.374
(Applause)

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.699
And most importantly,

00:15:01.723 --> 00:15:06.372
truth and fact are under assault.

00:15:07.109 --> 00:15:08.719
The job ahead of us,

00:15:08.743 --> 00:15:09.946
the task ahead of us,

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.564
the challenge ahead of us

00:15:11.588 --> 00:15:12.822
is great.

00:15:13.567 --> 00:15:16.204
The time to fight is short.

00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:19.904
We must act now.

00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:23.994
Later will be too late.

00:15:24.018 --> 00:15:25.280
Thank you very much.

00:15:25.304 --> 00:15:29.350
(Applause)
