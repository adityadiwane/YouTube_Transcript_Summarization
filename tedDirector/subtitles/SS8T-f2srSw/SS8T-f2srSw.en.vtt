00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I woke up in the middle of the night

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
with the sound of heavy explosion.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
It was deep at night.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
I do not remember what time it was.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
I just remember the sound

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
was so heavy

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
and so very shocking.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Everything in my room was shaking --

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
my heart, my windows,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
my bed, everything.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
I looked out the windows

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and I saw a full half-circle

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
of explosion.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
I thought it was just like the movies,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
but the movies had not conveyed them

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
in the powerful image that I was seeing

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
full of bright red

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and orange and gray,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and a full circle of explosion.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And I kept on staring at it

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
until it disappeared.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
I went back to my bed,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and I prayed,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and I secretly thanked God

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
that that missile

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
did not land on my family's home,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
that it did not kill my family that night.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
Thirty years have passed,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
and I still feel guilty about that prayer,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
for the next day, I learned that that missile

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.260
landed on my brother's friend's home

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
and killed him

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and his father,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
but did not kill his mother or his sister.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
His mother showed up the next week

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
at my brother's classroom

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and begged seven-year-old kids

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
to share with her any picture they may have

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
of her son,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
for she had lost everything.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
This is not a story

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
of a nameless survivor of war,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and nameless refugees,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and our TV

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
with tattered clothes,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
dirty face, scared eyes.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
This is not a story of a nameless someone

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
who lived in some war,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
who we do not know their hopes, their dreams,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
their accomplishments, their families,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
their beliefs, their values.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
This is my story.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
I was that girl.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
I am another image and vision

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
of another survivor of war.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
I am that refugee,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and I am that girl.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
You see,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
I grew up in war-torn Iraq,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and I believe that there are two sides of wars

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and we've only seen

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
one side of it.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
We only talk about

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
one side of it.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
But there's another side

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
that I have witnessed

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
as someone who lived in it

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and someone who ended up working in it.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
I grew up with the colors of war --

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
the red colors of fire and blood,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
the brown tones of earth

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
as it explodes

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
in our faces

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
and the piercing silver

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
of an exploded missile,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
so bright

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
that nothing can protect your eyes from it.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
I grew up

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
with the sounds of war --

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
the staccato sounds of gunfire,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
the wrenching booms of explosions,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
ominous drones of jets flying overhead

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and the wailing warning sounds

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
of sirens.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
These are the sounds you would expect,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
but they are also the sounds

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
screeching in the night,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
the high-pitched honest cries

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
of children

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
and the thunderous,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
unbearable

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
silence.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
"War," a friend of mine said,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
"is not about sound at all.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
It is actually about silence,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
the silence of humanity."

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
I have since left Iraq

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and founded a group called Women for Women International

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
that ends up working

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
with women survivors of wars.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
In my travels and in my work,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
from Congo to Afghanistan,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
from Sudan to Rwanda,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
I have learned not only

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
that the colors and the sounds of war are the same,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
but the fears of war are the same.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
You know, there is a fear of dying,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
and do not believe any movie character

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
where the hero is not afraid.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
It is very scary

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
to go through that feeling

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
of "I am about to die"

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
or "I could die in this explosion."

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
But there's also the fear

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
of losing loved ones,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and I think that's even worse.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
It's too painful. You don't want to think about it.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.260
But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear --

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo;

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
she said, "The fear

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
of losing

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
the 'I' in me,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
the fear of losing

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
the 'I' in me."

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
That's what my mother in Iraq

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
used to tell me.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
It's like dying from inside-out.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
A Palestinian woman once told me,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
"It is not about the fear of one death,"

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
she said, "sometimes I feel

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
I die 10 times in one day,"

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
as she was describing the marches of soldiers

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
and the sounds of their bullets.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
She said, "But it's not fair,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
because there is only one life,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
and there should only be one death."

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
We have been only seeing

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
one side of war.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
We have only been discussing and consumed

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
with high-level preoccupations

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
over troop levels, drawdown timelines,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
surges and sting operations,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
when we should be examining the details

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
of where the social fabric

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
has been most torn,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
where the community has improvised

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
and survived

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and shown acts of resilience

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
and amazing courage

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
just to keep life going.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
We have been so consumed

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
with seemingly objective discussions

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
of politics, tactics,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
weapons, dollars

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and casualties.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
This is the language

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
of sterility.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
How casually

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
we treat casualties

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
in the context of this topic.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
This is where we conceive of rape and casualties

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
as inevitabilities.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
Eighty percent of refugees around the world

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
are women and children. Oh.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Ninety percent of modern war casualties

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
are civilians.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
How interesting.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
Oh, half a million women in Rwanda

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
get raped in 100 days.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Or, as we speak now,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
hundreds of thousands of Congolese women

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
are getting raped and mutilated.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
How interesting.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
These just become numbers that we refer to.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
The front of wars

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
is increasingly non-human eyes

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
peering down on our perceived enemies

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
from space,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
guiding missiles toward unseen targets,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
while the human conduct

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
of the orchestra of media relations

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
in the event that this particular drone attack

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
hits a villager

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
instead of an extremist.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
It is a chess game.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
You learn to play an international relations school

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
on your way out and up

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
to national and international leadership.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
Checkmate.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
We are missing

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
a completely other side of wars.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
We are missing my mother's story,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
who made sure with every siren, with every raid,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
with every cut off-of electricity,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
she played puppet shows for my brothers and I,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
so we would not be scared

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
of the sounds of explosions.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
We are missing the story of Fareeda,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
a music teacher,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
a piano teacher, in Sarajevo,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
who made sure

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
that she kept the music school open

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
every single day

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
and walked to that school,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
despite the snipers shooting

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
at that school and at her,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
and kept the piano, the violin, the cello

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
playing the whole duration of the war,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
That was her fight.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
That was her resistance.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
We are missing the story of Nehia,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
a Palestinian woman in Gaza

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
who, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
she left out of home,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
collected all the flour

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
in case there is no cease-fire the day after.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
We are missing

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
the stories of Violet,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
who, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
she kept on going on,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
burying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
We are missing stories of women

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
who are literally keeping life going

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
in the midst of wars.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
Do you know --

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
do you know that people fall in love in war

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
and go to school

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
and go to factories and hospitals

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and get divorced and go dancing and go playing

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and live life going?

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
And the ones who are keeping that life

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
are women.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
There are two sides of war.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
There is a side that fights,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and there is a side that keeps the schools

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
and the factories and the hospitals open.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
There is a side that is focused on winning battles,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
and there is a side that is focused

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
on winning life.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
There is a side that leads the front-line discussion,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
and there is a side

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
that leads the back-line discussion.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
There is a side that thinks

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
that peace is the end of fighting,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and there is a side that thinks

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
that peace is the arrival

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
of schools and jobs.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
There is a side

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
that is led by men,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
and there is a side

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
that is led by women.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
And in order for us to understand

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
how do we build lasting peace,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
we must understand war and peace

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
from both sides.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
We must have a full picture

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
of what that means.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
In order for us to understand

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
what actually peace means,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
we need to understand,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
as one Sudanese woman once told me,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
"Peace is the fact that my toenails

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
are growing back again."

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
for 20 years of war,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
where it killed one million people

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
and displaced five million refugees.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
Many women were taken as slaves

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
by rebels and soldiers,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
as sexual slaves who were forced also

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
to carry the ammunition and the water

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
and the food for the soldiers.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
So that woman walked for 20 years,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
so she would not be kidnapped again.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
And only when there was some sort of peace,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
her toenails grew back again.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
We need to understand peace

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
from a toenail's perspective.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
We need to understand

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
that we cannot actually have negotiations

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
of ending of wars or peace

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
without fully including women

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
at the negotiating table.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
I find it amazing

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
that the only group of people

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
who are not fighting and not killing

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
and not pillaging and not burning and not raping,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
and the group of people who are mostly --

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
though not exclusively --

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
who are keeping life going in the midst of war,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
are not included in the negotiating table.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
but there are also men

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
who are excluded from that discussion.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
The doctors who are not fighting,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
the artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
they are, too, excluded

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
from the negotiating tables.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
building of democracy, sustainable economies,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
any kind of stabilities,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
if we do not fully include women

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
at the negotiating table.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Not one, but 50 percent.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
There is no way we can talk about the building of stability

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
if we don't start investing

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
in women and girls.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Did you know

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
that one year

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
of the world's military spending

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
equals 700 years

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
of the U.N. budget

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and equals 2,928 years

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
of the U.N. budget allocated for women?

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
If we just reverse

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
that distribution of funds,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
perhaps we could have

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
a better lasting peace in this world.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
And last, but not least,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
we need to invest in peace and women,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
not only because it is the right thing to do,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
not only because it is the right thing to do,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
but it is for the future.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
A Congolese woman,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
who was telling me about

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
how her children saw their father killed in front of them

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
and saw her raped in front of them

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and mutilated in front of them,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
killed in front of them,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
how they're doing okay right now.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
She got into Women for Women International's program.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
She got a support network.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
She learned about her rights.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
She was sending them to school. Have a new home.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
She said, "But what I worry about the most

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
is not any of that.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
I worry that my children

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
have hate in their hearts,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
and when they want to grow up, they want to fight again

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
the killers of their father and their brother."

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
We need to invest in women,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
because that's our only chance

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
to ensure that there is no more war

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
in the future.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
That mother has a better chance to heal her children

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
than any peace agreement can do.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
Are there good news? Of course, there are good news. There are lots of good news.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
To start with, these women that I told you about

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
are dancing and singing every single day,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
and if they can,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
who are we not to dance?

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
That girl that I told you about

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
ended up starting Women for Women International Group

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
that impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
and I started this from zero,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
nothing, nada, [unclear].

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
(Laughter)

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
They are women who are standing on their feet

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
in spite of their circumstances,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
not because of it.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
Think of how the world can be a much better place

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
if, for a change,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
we have a better equality,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
we have equality,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
we have a representation

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
and we understand war,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
both from the front-line

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
and the back-line discussion.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
Rumi, a 13th-century Sufi poet,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
says, "Out beyond the worlds

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
of right-doings and wrong-doings,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
there is a field.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
I will meet you there.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
When the soul lies down in that grass,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
the world is too full

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
to talk about.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
Ideas, language,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
even the phrase 'each other'

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
no longer makes any sense."

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
I humbly add -- humbly add --

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
that out beyond

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
the worlds of war and peace,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
there is a field,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
and there are many women and men

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
[who] are meeting there.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
Let us make this field a much bigger place.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
Let us all meet in that field.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
Thank you.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:39.260
(Applause)
