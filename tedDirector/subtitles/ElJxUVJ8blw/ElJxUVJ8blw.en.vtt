00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:16.023
I'm going to share with you
a paradigm-shifting perspective

00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:19.322
on the issues of gender violence:
sexual assault, domestic violence,

00:00:19.346 --> 00:00:22.514
relationship abuse, sexual harassment,
sexual abuse of children.

00:00:22.538 --> 00:00:23.848
That whole range of issues

00:00:23.872 --> 00:00:26.759
that I'll refer to in shorthand
as "gender violence issues,"

00:00:26.783 --> 00:00:30.867
they've been seen as women's issues
that some good men help out with,

00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:33.666
but I have a problem with that frame
and I don't accept it.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.943
I don't see these as women's issues
that some good men help out with.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:39.604
In fact, I'm going to argue
that these are men's issues,

00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:41.014
first and foremost.

00:00:41.038 --> 00:00:42.226
Now obviously --

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.508
(Applause)

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:46.416
Obviously, they're also women's issues,
so I appreciate that,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.087
but calling gender violence
a women's issue is part of the problem,

00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:52.739
for a number of reasons.

00:00:52.763 --> 00:00:56.237
The first is that it gives men
an excuse not to pay attention, right?

00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:58.307
A lot of men hear
the term "women's issues"

00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:00.320
and we tend to tune it out, and we think,

00:01:00.344 --> 00:01:03.249
"I'm a guy; that's for the girls,"
or "that's for the women."

00:01:03.273 --> 00:01:07.161
And a lot of men literally don't get
beyond the first sentence as a result.

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:09.538
It's almost like a chip
in our brain is activated,

00:01:09.562 --> 00:01:12.722
and the neural pathways take
our attention in a different direction

00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:14.607
when we hear the term "women's issues."

00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:17.090
This is also true, by the way,
of the word "gender,"

00:01:17.114 --> 00:01:19.432
because a lot of people
hear the word "gender"

00:01:19.456 --> 00:01:21.036
and they think it means "women."

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.240
So they think that gender issues
is synonymous with women's issues.

00:01:24.264 --> 00:01:26.375
There's some confusion
about the term gender.

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.984
And let me illustrate
that confusion by way of analogy.

00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:30.830
So let's talk for a moment about race.

00:01:30.854 --> 00:01:32.774
In the US, when we hear the word "race,"

00:01:32.798 --> 00:01:35.160
a lot of people think
that means African-American,

00:01:35.184 --> 00:01:37.257
Latino, Asian-American, Native American,

00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:40.057
South Asian, Pacific Islander, on and on.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.281
A lot of people, when they hear
the word "sexual orientation"

00:01:43.305 --> 00:01:45.720
think it means gay, lesbian, bisexual.

00:01:45.744 --> 00:01:48.285
And a lot of people,
when they hear the word "gender,"

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:49.463
think it means women.

00:01:49.487 --> 00:01:52.463
In each case, the dominant group
doesn't get paid attention to.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:55.237
As if white people don't have
some sort of racial identity

00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:58.251
or belong to some racial
category or construct,

00:01:58.275 --> 00:02:01.811
as if heterosexual people
don't have a sexual orientation,

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:03.935
as if men don't have a gender.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.737
This is one of the ways that dominant
systems maintain and reproduce themselves,

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.350
which is to say the dominant group
is rarely challenged

00:02:10.374 --> 00:02:12.034
to even think about its dominance,

00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:15.311
because that's one of the key
characteristics of power and privilege,

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:16.746
the ability to go unexamined,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.947
lacking introspection, in fact being
rendered invisible, in large measure,

00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:25.401
in the discourse about issues
that are primarily about us.

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:28.615
And this is amazing how this works
in domestic and sexual violence,

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:32.206
how men have been largely erased
from so much of the conversation

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.221
about a subject
that is centrally about men.

00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:37.580
And I'm going to illustrate
what I'm talking about

00:02:37.604 --> 00:02:38.952
by using the old tech.

00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:41.683
I'm old school
on some fundamental regards.

00:02:41.707 --> 00:02:44.442
I make films and I work with high tech,

00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:47.086
but I'm still old school as an educator,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.696
and I want to share with you this exercise

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.453
that illustrates
on the sentence-structure level

00:02:52.477 --> 00:02:57.008
how the way that we think,
literally the way that we use language,

00:02:57.032 --> 00:02:59.175
conspires to keep
our attention off of men.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.386
This is about domestic
violence in particular,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.834
but you can plug in other analogues.

00:03:04.858 --> 00:03:07.922
This comes from the work
of the feminist linguist Julia Penelope.

00:03:07.946 --> 00:03:10.114
It starts with a very basic
English sentence:

00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:13.567
"John beat Mary."

00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:15.092
That's a good English sentence.

00:03:15.116 --> 00:03:18.602
John is the subject, beat is the verb,
Mary is the object, good sentence.

00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:20.840
Now we're going to move
to the second sentence,

00:03:20.864 --> 00:03:23.210
which says the same thing
in the passive voice.

00:03:23.234 --> 00:03:28.473
"Mary was beaten by John."

00:03:29.564 --> 00:03:32.350
And now a whole lot
has happened in one sentence.

00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:34.479
We've gone from "John beat Mary"

00:03:34.503 --> 00:03:36.298
to "Mary was beaten by John."

00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:39.585
We've shifted our focus
in one sentence from John to Mary,

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.516
and you can see John is very close
to the end of the sentence,

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.506
well, close to dropping
off the map of our psychic plain.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.250
The third sentence, John is dropped,

00:03:47.274 --> 00:03:50.588
and we have, "Mary was beaten,"

00:03:50.612 --> 00:03:52.484
and now it's all about Mary.

00:03:52.508 --> 00:03:55.570
We're not even thinking about John,
it's totally focused on Mary.

00:03:55.594 --> 00:03:56.805
Over the past generation,

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.605
the term we've used
synonymous with "beaten" is "battered,"

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.676
so we have "Mary was battered."

00:04:03.324 --> 00:04:07.118
And the final sentence in this sequence,
flowing from the others, is,

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:09.816
"Mary is a battered woman."

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.338
So now Mary's very identity --
Mary is a battered woman --

00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:20.220
is what was done to her by John
in the first instance.

00:04:20.244 --> 00:04:23.460
But we've demonstrated that John
has long ago left the conversation.

00:04:23.484 --> 00:04:26.400
Those of us who work
in the domestic and sexual violence field

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:28.941
know that victim-blaming
is pervasive in this realm,

00:04:28.965 --> 00:04:31.904
which is to say, blaming the person
to whom something was done

00:04:31.928 --> 00:04:33.559
rather than the person who did it.

00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:35.791
And we say: why do they
go out with these men?

00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:38.695
Why are they attracted to them?
Why do they keep going back?

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.671
What was she wearing at that party?
What a stupid thing to do.

00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:44.383
Why was she drinking
with those guys in that hotel room?

00:04:44.407 --> 00:04:47.172
This is victim blaming,
and there are many reasons for it,

00:04:47.196 --> 00:04:50.802
but one is that our cognitive structure
is set up to blame victims.

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:51.993
This is all unconscious.

00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:54.642
Our whole cognitive structure
is set up to ask questions

00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:58.157
about women and women's choices
and what they're doing, thinking, wearing.

00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:01.503
And I'm not going to shout down
people who ask questions about women.

00:05:01.527 --> 00:05:03.028
It's a legitimate thing to ask.

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:05.351
But's let's be clear:
Asking questions about Mary

00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:08.507
is not going to get us anywhere
in terms of preventing violence.

00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:10.592
We have to ask a different
set of questions.

00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:14.197
The questions are not about Mary,
they're about John.

00:05:14.297 --> 00:05:17.086
They include things like,
why does John beat Mary?

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.941
Why is domestic violence still a big
problem in the US and all over the world?

00:05:20.965 --> 00:05:23.615
What's going on?
Why do so many men abuse physically,

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.825
emotionally, verbally, and other ways,

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.075
the women and girls, and the men and boys,
that they claim to love?

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.299
What's going on with men?

00:05:30.678 --> 00:05:34.132
Why do so many adult men
sexually abuse little girls and boys?

00:05:34.156 --> 00:05:36.193
Why is that a common problem
in our society

00:05:36.345 --> 00:05:37.860
and all over the world today?

00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:39.844
Why do we hear over and over again

00:05:39.868 --> 00:05:43.266
about new scandals erupting
in major institutions

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.567
like the Catholic Church
or the Penn State football program

00:05:46.591 --> 00:05:48.791
or the Boy Scouts of America,
on and on and on?

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:51.030
And then local communities
all over the country

00:05:51.054 --> 00:05:52.219
and all over the world.

00:05:52.243 --> 00:05:53.703
We hear about it all the time.

00:05:53.727 --> 00:05:55.225
The sexual abuse of children.

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:58.559
What's going on with men?
Why do so many men rape women

00:05:58.663 --> 00:06:00.414
in our society and around the world?

00:06:00.438 --> 00:06:02.165
Why do so many men rape other men?

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:03.736
What is going on with men?

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.728
And then what is the role
of the various institutions in our society

00:06:08.752 --> 00:06:11.536
that are helping to produce
abusive men at pandemic rates?

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.870
Because this isn't
about individual perpetrators.

00:06:13.894 --> 00:06:16.614
That's a naive way to understanding
what is a much deeper

00:06:16.638 --> 00:06:18.325
and more systematic social problem.

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.020
The perpetrators aren't these monsters
who crawl out of the swamp

00:06:22.044 --> 00:06:24.488
and come into town
and do their nasty business

00:06:24.512 --> 00:06:26.431
and then retreat into the darkness.

00:06:26.455 --> 00:06:28.737
That's a very naive notion, right?

00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:32.055
Perpetrators are much more normal
than that, and everyday than that.

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:36.456
So the question is, what are we doing here
in our society and in the world?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.485
What are the roles of various institutions

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:41.016
in helping to produce abusive men?

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.123
What's the role of religious
belief systems,

00:06:43.147 --> 00:06:45.288
the sports culture,
the pornography culture,

00:06:45.312 --> 00:06:48.027
the family structure, economics,
and how that intersects,

00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:50.290
and race and ethnicity
and how that intersects?

00:06:50.314 --> 00:06:51.793
How does all this work?

00:06:51.817 --> 00:06:54.720
And then, once we start making
those kinds of connections

00:06:54.744 --> 00:06:57.378
and asking those important
and big questions,

00:06:57.402 --> 00:06:59.860
then we can talk about
how we can be transformative,

00:06:59.884 --> 00:07:02.335
in other words, how can we do
something differently?

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:03.937
How can we change the practices?

00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:05.967
How can we change
the socialization of boys

00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:09.416
and the definitions of manhood
that lead to these current outcomes?

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.130
These are the kind of questions
that we need to be asking

00:07:12.154 --> 00:07:14.314
and the kind of work
that we need to be doing,

00:07:14.338 --> 00:07:17.901
but if we're endlessly focused
on what women are doing and thinking

00:07:17.925 --> 00:07:19.612
in relationships or elsewhere,

00:07:19.636 --> 00:07:22.058
we're not going to get to that piece.

00:07:22.082 --> 00:07:23.745
I understand that a lot of women

00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:26.248
who have been trying to speak out
about these issues,

00:07:26.272 --> 00:07:28.339
today and yesterday
and for years and years,

00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:30.619
often get shouted down for their efforts.

00:07:30.643 --> 00:07:35.639
They get called nasty names
like "male-basher" and "man-hater,"

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:42.205
and the disgusting
and offensive "feminazi", right?

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:43.970
And you know what all this is about?

00:07:43.994 --> 00:07:45.498
It's called kill the messenger.

00:07:45.522 --> 00:07:47.529
It's because the women who are standing up

00:07:47.553 --> 00:07:49.971
and speaking out for themselves
and for other women

00:07:49.995 --> 00:07:52.180
as well as for men and boys,

00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:54.576
it's a statement to them
to sit down and shut up,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.208
keep the current system in place,

00:07:56.232 --> 00:07:58.630
because we don't like it
when people rock the boat.

00:07:58.654 --> 00:08:01.002
We don't like it when people
challenge our power.

00:08:01.026 --> 00:08:03.148
You'd better sit
down and shut up, basically.

00:08:03.172 --> 00:08:05.423
And thank goodness
that women haven't done that.

00:08:05.447 --> 00:08:07.321
Thank goodness that we live in a world

00:08:07.345 --> 00:08:10.467
where there's so much women's leadership
that can counteract that.

00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:13.333
But one of the powerful roles
that men can play in this work

00:08:13.357 --> 00:08:16.283
is that we can say some things
that sometimes women can't say,

00:08:16.307 --> 00:08:18.690
or, better yet, we can be heard
saying some things

00:08:18.714 --> 00:08:20.667
that women often can't be heard saying.

00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:24.173
Now, I appreciate that that's a problem,
it's sexism, but it's the truth.

00:08:24.197 --> 00:08:26.095
So one of the things that I say to men,

00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:28.058
and my colleagues and I always say this,

00:08:28.082 --> 00:08:30.767
is we need more men
who have the courage and the strength

00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:33.201
to start standing up and saying
some of this stuff,

00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:35.326
and standing with women
and not against them

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.318
and pretending that somehow
this is a battle between the sexes

00:08:38.342 --> 00:08:39.688
and other kinds of nonsense.

00:08:39.712 --> 00:08:41.188
We live in the world together.

00:08:41.212 --> 00:08:43.884
And by the way, one of the things
that really bothers me

00:08:43.908 --> 00:08:46.495
about some of the rhetoric
against feminists and others

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:50.221
who have built the battered women's
and rape crisis movements around the world

00:08:50.245 --> 00:08:52.749
is that somehow, like I said,
that they're anti-male.

00:08:52.773 --> 00:08:56.028
What about all the boys who are profoundly
affected in a negative way

00:08:56.052 --> 00:08:59.835
by what some adult man is doing against
their mother, themselves, their sisters?

00:08:59.859 --> 00:09:01.135
What about all those boys?

00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:02.927
What about all the young men and boys

00:09:02.951 --> 00:09:05.312
who have been traumatized
by adult men's violence?

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:06.524
You know what?

00:09:06.548 --> 00:09:08.928
The same system that produces
men who abuse women,

00:09:08.952 --> 00:09:10.539
produces men who abuse other men.

00:09:10.563 --> 00:09:14.031
And if we want to talk about male victims,
let's talk about male victims.

00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:17.361
Most male victims of violence
are the victims of other men's violence.

00:09:17.385 --> 00:09:20.171
So that's something that both women
and men have in common.

00:09:20.195 --> 00:09:22.076
We are both victims of men's violence.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.132
So we have it in our direct self-interest,

00:09:24.156 --> 00:09:26.446
not to mention the fact
that most men that I know

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.679
have women and girls
that we care deeply about,

00:09:28.703 --> 00:09:31.681
in our families and our friendship
circles and every other way.

00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:34.354
So there's so many reasons
why we need men to speak out.

00:09:34.378 --> 00:09:37.398
It seems obvious saying it
out loud, doesn't it?

00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:41.324
Now, the nature of the work
that I do and my colleagues do

00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:45.005
in the sports culture
and the US military, in schools,

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:47.877
we pioneered this approach
called the bystander approach

00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:49.889
to gender-violence prevention.

00:09:49.913 --> 00:09:53.232
And I just want to give you
the highlights of the bystander approach,

00:09:53.256 --> 00:09:55.691
because it's a big thematic shift,

00:09:55.715 --> 00:09:57.536
although there's lots of particulars,

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.858
but the heart of it is,
instead of seeing men as perpetrators

00:10:00.882 --> 00:10:02.120
and women as victims,

00:10:02.144 --> 00:10:05.600
or women as perpetrators, men as victims,

00:10:05.624 --> 00:10:07.187
or any combination in there.

00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:08.604
I'm using the gender binary.

00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:12.126
I know there's more than men and women,
there's more than male and female.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.107
And there are women who are perpetrators,

00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:16.278
and of course there are
men who are victims.

00:10:16.302 --> 00:10:17.514
There's a whole spectrum.

00:10:17.538 --> 00:10:19.749
But instead of seeing it
in the binary fashion,

00:10:19.773 --> 00:10:22.129
we focus on all of us
as what we call bystanders,

00:10:22.153 --> 00:10:26.320
and a bystander is defined as anybody
who is not a perpetrator or a victim

00:10:26.344 --> 00:10:27.952
in a given situation,

00:10:27.976 --> 00:10:32.014
so in other words friends, teammates,
colleagues, coworkers, family members,

00:10:32.038 --> 00:10:35.952
those of us who are not directly
involved in a dyad of abuse,

00:10:35.976 --> 00:10:39.298
but we are embedded in social,
family, work, school,

00:10:39.322 --> 00:10:41.082
and other peer culture relationships

00:10:41.106 --> 00:10:43.134
with people who might be
in that situation.

00:10:43.158 --> 00:10:46.358
What do we do? How do we speak up?
How do we challenge our friends?

00:10:46.382 --> 00:10:47.876
How do we support our friends?

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.411
But how do we not remain silent
in the face of abuse?

00:10:50.435 --> 00:10:53.121
Now, when it comes
to men and male culture,

00:10:53.145 --> 00:10:56.541
the goal is to get men who are not abusive
to challenge men who are.

00:10:56.565 --> 00:10:59.812
And when I say abusive, I don't mean just
men who are beating women.

00:10:59.836 --> 00:11:04.632
We're not just saying a man whose friend
is abusing his girlfriend

00:11:04.656 --> 00:11:07.473
needs to stop the guy
at the moment of attack.

00:11:07.497 --> 00:11:11.951
That's a naive way
of creating a social change.

00:11:11.975 --> 00:11:15.871
It's along a continuum, we're trying
to get men to interrupt each other.

00:11:15.895 --> 00:11:18.823
So, for example, if you're a guy
and you're in a group of guys

00:11:18.847 --> 00:11:21.715
playing poker, talking, hanging out,
no women present,

00:11:21.739 --> 00:11:28.088
and another guy says something sexist
or degrading or harassing about women,

00:11:28.112 --> 00:11:30.964
instead of laughing along
or pretending you didn't hear it,

00:11:30.988 --> 00:11:33.005
we need men to say,
"Hey, that's not funny.

00:11:33.029 --> 00:11:35.279
that could be my sister
you're talking about,

00:11:35.303 --> 00:11:37.267
and could you joke about something else?

00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:39.167
Or could you talk about something else?

00:11:39.191 --> 00:11:41.022
I don't appreciate that kind of talk."

00:11:41.046 --> 00:11:42.691
Just like if you're a white person

00:11:42.715 --> 00:11:45.958
and another white person makes
a racist comment, you'd hope, I hope,

00:11:45.982 --> 00:11:48.606
that white people would interrupt
that racist enactment

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.867
by a fellow white person.

00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:52.757
Just like with heterosexism,
if you're a heterosexual person

00:11:52.781 --> 00:11:55.588
and you yourself don't enact
harassing or abusive behaviors

00:11:55.612 --> 00:11:57.822
towards people of varying
sexual orientations,

00:11:57.846 --> 00:12:01.566
if you don't say something in the face
of other heterosexual people doing that,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.901
then, in a sense, isn't your silence
a form of consent and complicity?

00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:07.760
Well, the bystander approach
is trying to give people tools

00:12:07.784 --> 00:12:11.605
to interrupt that process and to speak up
and to create a peer culture climate

00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:14.293
where the abusive behavior
will be seen as unacceptable,

00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:17.084
not just because it's illegal,
but because it's wrong

00:12:17.108 --> 00:12:19.159
and unacceptable in the peer culture.

00:12:19.183 --> 00:12:21.579
And if we can get to the place where men

00:12:21.603 --> 00:12:23.894
who act out in sexist ways
will lose status,

00:12:23.918 --> 00:12:25.823
young men and boys who act out in sexist

00:12:25.847 --> 00:12:27.863
and harassing ways
towards girls and women,

00:12:27.887 --> 00:12:29.826
as well as towards other boys and men,

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.367
will lose status
as a result of it, guess what?

00:12:32.391 --> 00:12:35.372
We'll see a radical
diminution of the abuse.

00:12:35.396 --> 00:12:38.043
Because the typical perpetrator
is not sick and twisted.

00:12:38.067 --> 00:12:40.761
He's a normal guy
in every other way, isn't he?

00:12:40.785 --> 00:12:44.153
Now, among the many great
things that Martin Luther King

00:12:44.177 --> 00:12:45.696
said in his short life was,

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.123
"In the end, what will hurt the most
is not the words of our enemies

00:12:49.147 --> 00:12:51.201
but the silence of our friends."

00:12:51.225 --> 00:12:54.396
In the end, what will hurt the most
is not the words of our enemies

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.935
but the silence of our friends.

00:12:55.959 --> 00:12:58.414
There's been an awful lot
of silence in male culture

00:12:58.438 --> 00:13:00.511
about this ongoing tragedy
of men's violence

00:13:00.535 --> 00:13:02.505
against women and children, hasn't there?

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:04.315
There's been an awful lot of silence.

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:07.191
And all I'm saying is that we need
to break that silence,

00:13:07.215 --> 00:13:09.077
and we need more men to do that.

00:13:09.475 --> 00:13:12.774
Now, it's easier said than done,

00:13:12.798 --> 00:13:14.188
because I'm saying it now,

00:13:14.212 --> 00:13:16.686
but I'm telling you
it's not easy in male culture

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.611
for guys to challenge each other,

00:13:18.635 --> 00:13:21.016
which is one of the reasons

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.348
why part of the paradigm shift
that has to happen

00:13:23.372 --> 00:13:26.110
is not just understanding
these issues as men's issues,

00:13:26.134 --> 00:13:28.181
but they're also
leadership issues for men.

00:13:28.205 --> 00:13:31.643
Because ultimately, the responsibility
for taking a stand on these issues

00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:33.942
should not fall
on the shoulders of little boys

00:13:33.966 --> 00:13:36.786
or teenage boys in high school
or college men.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.755
It should be on adult men with power.

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:41.940
Adult men with power are the ones
we need to be holding accountable

00:13:41.964 --> 00:13:43.629
for being leaders on these issues,

00:13:43.653 --> 00:13:45.972
because when somebody
speaks up in a peer culture

00:13:45.996 --> 00:13:47.932
and challenges and interrupts,

00:13:47.956 --> 00:13:50.530
he or she is being a leader, really.

00:13:50.554 --> 00:13:53.805
But on a big scale,
we need more adult men with power

00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:55.975
to start prioritizing these issues,

00:13:55.999 --> 00:13:58.428
and we haven't seen that yet, have we?

00:13:58.452 --> 00:14:01.858
Now, I was at a dinner
a number of years ago,

00:14:01.882 --> 00:14:05.071
and I work extensively
with the US military, all the services.

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:07.937
And I was at this dinner
and this woman said to me --

00:14:08.636 --> 00:14:10.793
I think she thought
she was a little clever --

00:14:10.817 --> 00:14:15.363
she said, "So how long have you been doing
sensitivity training with the Marines?"

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:18.633
And I said, "With all due respect,

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:21.186
I don't do sensitivity training
with the Marines.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.488
I run a leadership program
in the Marine Corps."

00:14:23.512 --> 00:14:25.586
Now, I know it's a bit
pompous, my response,

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.371
but it's an important distinction,

00:14:27.395 --> 00:14:30.544
because I don't believe
that what we need is sensitivity training.

00:14:30.568 --> 00:14:33.004
We need leadership training,
because, for example,

00:14:33.028 --> 00:14:36.794
when a professional coach or a manager
of a baseball team or a football team --

00:14:36.818 --> 00:14:39.124
and I work extensively
in that realm as well --

00:14:39.148 --> 00:14:42.351
makes a sexist comment,
makes a homophobic statement,

00:14:42.375 --> 00:14:43.916
makes a racist comment,

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.320
there will be discussions on the sports
blogs and in sports talk radio.

00:14:47.344 --> 00:14:50.126
And some people will say,
"He needs sensitivity training."

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.155
Other people will say, "Well, get off it.

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:54.349
That's political correctness run amok,

00:14:54.373 --> 00:14:56.177
he made a stupid statement, move on."

00:14:56.201 --> 00:14:58.831
My argument is, he doesn't need
sensitivity training.

00:14:58.855 --> 00:15:00.263
He needs leadership training,

00:15:00.287 --> 00:15:01.823
because he's being a bad leader,

00:15:01.847 --> 00:15:04.974
because in a society with gender diversity
and sexual diversity --

00:15:04.998 --> 00:15:06.063
(Applause)

00:15:06.087 --> 00:15:07.626
and racial and ethnic diversity,

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.857
you make those kind of comments,
you're failing at your leadership.

00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:13.069
If we can make this point that I'm making

00:15:13.093 --> 00:15:15.734
to powerful men and women in our society

00:15:15.758 --> 00:15:18.829
at all levels of institutional
authority and power,

00:15:18.853 --> 00:15:22.083
it's going to change
the paradigm of people's thinking.

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:24.161
You know, for example,

00:15:24.185 --> 00:15:26.461
I work a lot in college
and university athletics

00:15:26.485 --> 00:15:28.019
throughout North America.

00:15:29.087 --> 00:15:32.902
We know so much about how to prevent
domestic and sexual violence, right?

00:15:33.613 --> 00:15:35.985
There's no excuse
for a college or university

00:15:36.009 --> 00:15:38.867
to not have domestic and sexual
violence prevention training

00:15:38.891 --> 00:15:41.701
mandated for all student athletes,
coaches, administrators,

00:15:41.725 --> 00:15:44.073
as part of their educational process.

00:15:44.097 --> 00:15:46.645
We know enough to know
that we can easily do that.

00:15:46.669 --> 00:15:48.757
But you know what's missing?
The leadership.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.021
But it's not the leadership
of student athletes.

00:15:51.045 --> 00:15:53.175
It's the leadership
of the athletic director,

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:55.710
the president of the university,
the people in charge

00:15:55.734 --> 00:15:57.403
who make decisions about resources

00:15:57.427 --> 00:16:00.730
and who make decisions about priorities
in the institutional settings.

00:16:00.754 --> 00:16:03.290
That's a failure, in most cases,
of men's leadership.

00:16:03.314 --> 00:16:04.508
Look at Penn State.

00:16:04.532 --> 00:16:08.640
Penn State is the mother of all teachable
moments for the bystander approach.

00:16:08.664 --> 00:16:11.125
You had so many situations in that realm

00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:14.792
where men in powerful
positions failed to act

00:16:14.816 --> 00:16:17.227
to protect children, in this case, boys.

00:16:17.251 --> 00:16:18.504
It's unbelievable, really.

00:16:18.528 --> 00:16:21.611
But when you get into it,
you realize there are pressures on men.

00:16:21.635 --> 00:16:24.436
There are constraints
within peer cultures on men,

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.644
which is why we need to encourage men
to break through those pressures.

00:16:28.668 --> 00:16:30.597
And one of the ways to do that is to say

00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:33.601
there's an awful lot of men
who care deeply about these issues.

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.106
I know this, I work with men,

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.309
and I've been working
with tens of thousands,

00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:39.697
hundreds of thousands of men
for many decades now.

00:16:39.721 --> 00:16:42.195
It's scary, when you think
about it, how many years.

00:16:42.219 --> 00:16:45.675
But there's so many men
who care deeply about these issues,

00:16:45.699 --> 00:16:47.840
but caring deeply is not enough.

00:16:47.864 --> 00:16:50.354
We need more men with the guts,

00:16:50.378 --> 00:16:53.813
with the courage, with the strength,
with the moral integrity

00:16:53.837 --> 00:16:57.829
to break our complicit silence
and challenge each other

00:16:57.853 --> 00:16:59.853
and stand with women and not against them.

00:17:00.192 --> 00:17:01.883
By the way, we owe it to women.

00:17:01.907 --> 00:17:03.349
There's no question about it.

00:17:03.373 --> 00:17:04.994
But we also owe it to our sons.

00:17:05.018 --> 00:17:08.237
We also owe it to young men
who are growing up all over the world

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:10.528
in situations where they didn't
make the choice

00:17:10.552 --> 00:17:13.925
to be a man in a culture that tells them
that manhood is a certain way.

00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:15.615
They didn't make the choice.

00:17:15.639 --> 00:17:20.636
We that have a choice, have an opportunity
and a responsibility to them as well.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.591
I hope that, going forward, men and women,

00:17:23.615 --> 00:17:25.907
working together, can begin the change

00:17:25.931 --> 00:17:27.907
and the transformation that will happen

00:17:27.931 --> 00:17:30.706
so that future generations
won't have the level of tragedy

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.506
that we deal with on a daily basis.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.340
I know we can do it, we can do better.

00:17:34.364 --> 00:17:35.747
Thank you very much.
