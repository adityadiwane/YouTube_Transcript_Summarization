00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:21.950
What is going to be the future of learning?

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.230
I do have a plan,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.310
but in order for me to tell you what that plan is,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.280
I need to tell you a little story,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.126
which kind of sets the stage.

00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:34.913
I tried to look at

00:00:34.913 --> 00:00:38.320
where did the kind of learning we do in schools,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.590
where did it come from?

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.022
And you can look far back into the past,

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:46.835
but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is,

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:50.537
it's quite easy to figure out where it came from.

00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:54.485
It came from about 300 years ago,

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.702
and it came from the last

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:59.670
and the biggest of the empires on this planet. ["The British Empire"]

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.015
Imagine trying to run the show,

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:04.423
trying to run the entire planet,

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:08.247
without computers, without telephones,

00:01:08.247 --> 00:01:12.379
with data handwritten on pieces of paper,

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:15.929
and traveling by ships.

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.083
But the Victorians actually did it.

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:21.251
What they did was amazing.

00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:24.563
They created a global computer

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:27.619
made up of people.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.412
It's still with us today.

00:01:29.412 --> 00:01:35.391
It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine.

00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:38.718
In order to have that machine running,

00:01:38.718 --> 00:01:41.919
you need lots and lots of people.

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:46.278
They made another machine to produce those people:

00:01:46.278 --> 00:01:49.174
the school.

00:01:49.174 --> 00:01:51.951
The schools would produce the people

00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:55.800
who would then become parts of the

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.185
bureaucratic administrative machine.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:03.575
They must be identical to each other.

00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:05.732
They must know three things:

00:02:05.732 --> 00:02:08.772
They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten;

00:02:08.772 --> 00:02:10.927
they must be able to read;

00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:13.206
and they must be able to do multiplication,

00:02:13.206 --> 00:02:16.869
division, addition and subtraction in their head.

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.396
They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand

00:02:20.396 --> 00:02:22.731
and ship them to Canada

00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:26.812
and he would be instantly functional.

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:29.681
The Victorians were great engineers.

00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:33.170
They engineered a system that was so robust

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.625
that it's still with us today,

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:39.601
continuously producing identical people

00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:44.417
for a machine that no longer exists.

00:02:44.417 --> 00:02:47.345
The empire is gone,

00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:50.249
so what are we doing with that design

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:52.618
that produces these identical people,

00:02:52.618 --> 00:02:55.521
and what are we going to do next

00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:59.441
if we ever are going to do anything else with it?

00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:01.131
["Schools as we know them are obsolete"]

00:03:01.131 --> 00:03:03.023
So that's a pretty strong comment there.

00:03:03.023 --> 00:03:06.817
I said schools as we know them now, they're obsolete.

00:03:06.817 --> 00:03:08.551
I'm not saying they're broken.

00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:11.548
It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken.

00:03:11.548 --> 00:03:15.199
It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:21.425
It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated.

00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:23.832
What are the kind of jobs that we have today?

00:03:23.832 --> 00:03:25.966
Well, the clerks are the computers.

00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:28.497
They're there in thousands in every office.

00:03:28.497 --> 00:03:31.702
And you have people who guide those computers

00:03:31.702 --> 00:03:34.179
to do their clerical jobs.

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.443
Those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand.

00:03:37.443 --> 00:03:40.475
They don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads.

00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:42.747
They do need to be able to read.

00:03:42.747 --> 00:03:46.897
In fact, they need to be able to read discerningly.

00:03:46.897 --> 00:03:50.004
Well, that's today, but we don't even know

00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:52.563
what the jobs of the future are going to look like.

00:03:52.563 --> 00:03:55.207
We know that people will work from wherever they want,

00:03:55.207 --> 00:03:58.405
whenever they want, in whatever way they want.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:02.593
How is present-day schooling going to prepare them

00:04:02.593 --> 00:04:05.136
for that world?

00:04:05.136 --> 00:04:10.184
Well, I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident.

00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:12.816
I used to teach people how to write computer programs

00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:15.280
in New Delhi, 14 years ago.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.037
And right next to where I used to work, there was a slum.

00:04:19.037 --> 00:04:21.624
And I used to think, how on Earth are those kids

00:04:21.624 --> 00:04:24.144
ever going to learn to write computer programs?

00:04:24.144 --> 00:04:27.224
Or should they not?

00:04:27.224 --> 00:04:29.841
At the same time, we also had lots of parents,

00:04:29.841 --> 00:04:32.272
rich people, who had computers,

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.403
and who used to tell me, "You know, my son,

00:04:35.403 --> 00:04:37.592
I think he's gifted,

00:04:37.592 --> 00:04:40.466
because he does wonderful things with computers.

00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:44.442
And my daughter -- oh, surely she is extra-intelligent."

00:04:44.442 --> 00:04:46.550
And so on. So I suddenly figured that,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.346
how come all the rich people are having

00:04:48.346 --> 00:04:50.487
these extraordinarily gifted children?

00:04:50.487 --> 00:04:52.402
(Laughter)

00:04:52.402 --> 00:04:55.226
What did the poor do wrong?

00:04:55.226 --> 00:04:58.229
I made a hole in the boundary wall

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.261
of the slum next to my office,

00:05:00.261 --> 00:05:03.005
and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen

00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:05.989
if I gave a computer to children who never would have one,

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:09.325
didn't know any English, didn't know what the Internet was.

00:05:09.325 --> 00:05:10.277
The children came running in.

00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:12.447
It was three feet off the ground, and they said, "What is this?"

00:05:12.447 --> 00:05:15.431
And I said, "Yeah, it's, I don't know."

00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:17.647
(Laughter)

00:05:17.647 --> 00:05:20.203
They said, "Why have you put it there?"

00:05:20.203 --> 00:05:21.418
I said, "Just like that."

00:05:21.418 --> 00:05:24.427
And they said, "Can we touch it?"I said, "If you wish to."

00:05:24.427 --> 00:05:26.804
And I went away.

00:05:26.804 --> 00:05:28.548
About eight hours later,

00:05:28.548 --> 00:05:31.503
we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse.

00:05:31.503 --> 00:05:34.000
So I said, "Well that's impossible, because --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.541
How is it possible? They don't know anything."

00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:40.405
My colleagues said, "No, it's a simple solution.

00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:43.228
One of your students must have been passing by,

00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:45.323
showed them how to use the mouse."

00:05:45.323 --> 00:05:46.846
So I said, "Yeah, that's possible."

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.905
So I repeated the experiment. I went 300 miles out of Delhi

00:05:49.905 --> 00:05:51.896
into a really remote village

00:05:51.896 --> 00:05:55.688
where the chances of a passing software development engineer

00:05:55.688 --> 00:06:00.104
was very little. (Laughter)

00:06:00.104 --> 00:06:02.767
I repeated the experiment there.

00:06:02.767 --> 00:06:05.054
There was no place to stay, so I stuck my computer in,

00:06:05.054 --> 00:06:07.254
I went away, came back after a couple of months,

00:06:07.254 --> 00:06:08.949
found kids playing games on it.

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:09.900
When they saw me, they said,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.382
"We want a faster processor and a better mouse."

00:06:12.382 --> 00:06:16.676
(Laughter)

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:20.085
So I said, "How on Earth do you know all this?"

00:06:20.085 --> 00:06:22.540
And they said something very interesting to me.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.205
In an irritated voice, they said,

00:06:24.205 --> 00:06:26.758
"You've given us a machine that works only in English,

00:06:26.758 --> 00:06:32.843
so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it." (Laughter)

00:06:32.843 --> 00:06:34.820
That's the first time, as a teacher,

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.911
that I had heard the word "teach ourselves" said so casually.

00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:43.513
Here's a short glimpse from those years.

00:06:43.513 --> 00:06:46.160
That's the first day at the Hole in the Wall.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.398
On your right is an eight-year-old.

00:06:48.398 --> 00:06:54.118
To his left is his student. She's six.

00:06:54.118 --> 00:06:57.715
And he's teaching her how to browse.

00:06:57.715 --> 00:07:01.001
Then onto other parts of the country,

00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:03.284
I repeated this over and over again,

00:07:03.284 --> 00:07:06.729
getting exactly the same results that we were.

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:10.656
["Hole in the wall film - 1999"]

00:07:10.656 --> 00:07:14.921
An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.277
And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is,

00:07:25.277 --> 00:07:29.526
and said, "There's a processor inside."

00:07:29.526 --> 00:07:32.019
So I started publishing.

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.574
I published everywhere. I wrote down and measured everything,

00:07:34.574 --> 00:07:36.776
and I said, in nine months, a group of children

00:07:36.776 --> 00:07:39.474
left alone with a computer in any language

00:07:39.474 --> 00:07:43.989
will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West.

00:07:43.989 --> 00:07:48.749
I'd seen it happen over and over and over again.

00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:51.481
But I was curious to know, what else would they do

00:07:51.481 --> 00:07:53.721
if they could do this much?

00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:56.249
I started experimenting with other subjects,

00:07:56.249 --> 00:07:59.217
among them, for example, pronunciation.

00:07:59.217 --> 00:08:01.665
There's one community of children in southern India

00:08:01.665 --> 00:08:04.433
whose English pronunciation is really bad,

00:08:04.433 --> 00:08:07.953
and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs.

00:08:07.953 --> 00:08:12.031
I gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer,

00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:15.305
and I said, "Keep talking into it until it types what you say."

00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:19.937
(Laughter)

00:08:19.937 --> 00:08:25.121
They did that, and watch a little bit of this.

00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:30.633
Computer: Nice to meet you.Child: Nice to meet you.

00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:32.904
Sugata Mitra: The reason I ended with the face

00:08:32.904 --> 00:08:36.721
of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her.

00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:40.217
She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad

00:08:40.217 --> 00:08:44.939
and may have tortured you about your credit card bills

00:08:44.939 --> 00:08:49.712
in a very clear English accent.

00:08:49.712 --> 00:08:54.089
So then people said, well, how far will it go?

00:08:54.089 --> 00:08:55.659
Where does it stop?

00:08:55.659 --> 00:08:59.022
I decided I would destroy my own argument

00:08:59.022 --> 00:09:01.526
by creating an absurd proposition.

00:09:01.526 --> 00:09:05.414
I made a hypothesis, a ridiculous hypothesis.

00:09:05.414 --> 00:09:07.218
Tamil is a south Indian language, and I said,

00:09:07.218 --> 00:09:09.863
can Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village

00:09:09.863 --> 00:09:13.368
learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English

00:09:13.368 --> 00:09:15.615
from a streetside computer?

00:09:15.615 --> 00:09:17.800
And I said, I'll measure them. They'll get a zero.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.854
I'll spend a couple of months, I'll leave it for a couple of months,

00:09:20.854 --> 00:09:23.158
I'll go back, they'll get another zero.

00:09:23.158 --> 00:09:27.514
I'll go back to the lab and say, we need teachers.

00:09:27.514 --> 00:09:31.577
I found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India.

00:09:31.577 --> 00:09:34.254
I put in Hole in the Wall computers there,

00:09:34.254 --> 00:09:37.941
downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication,

00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:41.246
most of which I didn't understand.

00:09:41.246 --> 00:09:44.223
The children came rushing, said, "What's all this?"

00:09:44.223 --> 00:09:49.231
So I said, "It's very topical, very important. But it's all in English."

00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:52.585
So they said, "How can we understand such big English words

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:54.663
and diagrams and chemistry?"

00:09:54.663 --> 00:09:57.487
So by now, I had developed a new pedagogical method,

00:09:57.487 --> 00:10:00.371
so I applied that. I said, "I haven't the foggiest idea."

00:10:00.371 --> 00:10:03.566
(Laughter)

00:10:03.566 --> 00:10:06.516
"And anyway, I am going away."

00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:10.884
(Laughter)

00:10:10.884 --> 00:10:14.473
So I left them for a couple of months.

00:10:14.473 --> 00:10:17.108
They'd got a zero. I gave them a test.

00:10:17.108 --> 00:10:18.032
I came back after two months

00:10:18.032 --> 00:10:21.692
and the children trooped in and said, "We've understood nothing."

00:10:21.692 --> 00:10:23.767
So I said, "Well, what did I expect?"

00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:27.852
So I said, "Okay, but how long did it take you

00:10:27.852 --> 00:10:30.613
before you decided that you can't understand anything?"

00:10:30.613 --> 00:10:32.561
So they said, "We haven't given up.

00:10:32.561 --> 00:10:34.537
We look at it every single day."

00:10:34.537 --> 00:10:37.002
So I said, "What? You don't understand these screens

00:10:37.002 --> 00:10:39.706
and you keep staring at it for two months? What for?"

00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:42.219
So a little girl who you see just now,

00:10:42.219 --> 00:10:44.951
she raised her hand, and she says to me in broken Tamil and English,

00:10:44.951 --> 00:10:47.148
she said, "Well, apart from the fact that

00:10:47.148 --> 00:10:50.299
improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease,

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:52.820
we haven't understood anything else."

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:58.532
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:58.532 --> 00:11:02.652
So I tested them.

00:11:02.652 --> 00:11:05.924
I got an educational impossibility, zero to 30 percent

00:11:05.924 --> 00:11:08.228
in two months in the tropical heat

00:11:08.228 --> 00:11:11.668
with a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know

00:11:11.668 --> 00:11:14.740
doing something that's a decade ahead of their time.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:20.117
Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm.

00:11:20.117 --> 00:11:23.517
Thirty percent is a fail.

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:26.453
How do I get them to pass? I have to get them 20 more marks.

00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:31.290
I couldn't find a teacher. What I did find was a friend that they had,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.676
a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant

00:11:33.676 --> 00:11:36.124
and she played with them all the time.

00:11:36.124 --> 00:11:38.245
So I asked this girl, "Can you help them?"

00:11:38.245 --> 00:11:40.516
So she says, "Absolutely not.

00:11:40.516 --> 00:11:43.593
I didn't have science in school. I have no idea

00:11:43.593 --> 00:11:48.122
what they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you."

00:11:48.122 --> 00:11:52.653
I said, "I'll tell you what. Use the method of the grandmother."

00:11:52.653 --> 00:11:53.983
So she says, "What's that?"

00:11:53.983 --> 00:11:55.370
I said, "Stand behind them.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:56.976
Whenever they do anything, you just say,

00:11:56.992 --> 00:11:59.773
'Well, wow, I mean, how did you do that?

00:11:59.789 --> 00:12:02.885
What's the next page? Gosh, when I was your age, I could have never done that.'

00:12:02.885 --> 00:12:05.807
You know what grannies do."

00:12:05.807 --> 00:12:07.981
So she did that for two more months.

00:12:07.981 --> 00:12:10.895
The scores jumped to 50 percent.

00:12:10.895 --> 00:12:12.549
Kallikuppam had caught up

00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:14.427
with my control school in New Delhi,

00:12:14.427 --> 00:12:18.563
a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher.

00:12:18.563 --> 00:12:23.400
When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.496
Here's Kallikuppam.

00:12:25.496 --> 00:12:33.691
(Children speaking) Neurons ... communication.

00:12:33.691 --> 00:12:37.382
I got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff,

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:39.878
but what she was saying, as you could make out,

00:12:39.878 --> 00:12:42.285
was about neurons, with her hands were like that,

00:12:42.285 --> 00:12:45.841
and she was saying neurons communicate.

00:12:45.841 --> 00:12:49.185
At 12.

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:52.395
So what are jobs going to be like?

00:12:52.395 --> 00:12:54.686
Well, we know what they're like today.

00:12:54.686 --> 00:12:57.024
What's learning going to be like? We know what it's like today,

00:12:57.024 --> 00:13:00.077
children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand

00:13:00.077 --> 00:13:03.850
and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.809
What will it be tomorrow?

00:13:07.809 --> 00:13:12.709
Could it be that we don't need to go to school at all?

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:16.249
Could it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something,

00:13:16.249 --> 00:13:19.569
you can find out in two minutes?

00:13:19.569 --> 00:13:23.674
Could it be -- a devastating question,

00:13:23.674 --> 00:13:26.466
a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte --

00:13:26.466 --> 00:13:29.505
could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in

00:13:29.505 --> 00:13:32.865
a future where knowing is obsolete?

00:13:32.865 --> 00:13:35.398
But that's terrible. We are homo sapiens.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:39.315
Knowing, that's what distinguishes us from the apes.

00:13:39.315 --> 00:13:41.092
But look at it this way.

00:13:41.092 --> 00:13:43.638
It took nature 100 million years

00:13:43.638 --> 00:13:45.774
to make the ape stand up

00:13:45.774 --> 00:13:47.958
and become Homo sapiens.

00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:51.654
It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete.

00:13:51.654 --> 00:13:53.836
What an achievement that is.

00:13:53.836 --> 00:13:57.863
But we have to integrate that into our own future.

00:13:57.863 --> 00:14:00.822
Encouragement seems to be the key.

00:14:00.822 --> 00:14:02.032
If you look at Kuppam,

00:14:02.032 --> 00:14:04.846
if you look at all of the experiments that I did,

00:14:04.846 --> 00:14:11.981
it was simply saying, "Wow," saluting learning.

00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:14.375
There is evidence from neuroscience.

00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:17.577
The reptilian part of our brain, which sits in the center of our brain,

00:14:17.577 --> 00:14:21.313
when it's threatened, it shuts down everything else,

00:14:21.313 --> 00:14:24.991
it shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the parts which learn,

00:14:24.991 --> 00:14:27.735
it shuts all of that down.

00:14:27.735 --> 00:14:31.883
Punishment and examinations are seen as threats.

00:14:31.883 --> 00:14:35.508
We take our children, we make them shut their brains down,

00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:38.204
and then we say, "Perform."

00:14:38.204 --> 00:14:41.685
Why did they create a system like that?

00:14:41.685 --> 00:14:43.331
Because it was needed.

00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:45.916
There was an age in the Age of Empires

00:14:45.916 --> 00:14:50.186
when you needed those people who can survive under threat.

00:14:50.186 --> 00:14:52.453
When you're standing in a trench all alone,

00:14:52.453 --> 00:14:56.484
if you could have survived, you're okay, you've passed.

00:14:56.484 --> 00:14:59.457
If you didn't, you failed.

00:14:59.457 --> 00:15:02.113
But the Age of Empires is gone.

00:15:02.113 --> 00:15:05.751
What happens to creativity in our age?

00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:08.766
We need to shift that balance back

00:15:08.766 --> 00:15:12.175
from threat to pleasure.

00:15:12.175 --> 00:15:16.127
I came back to England looking for British grandmothers.

00:15:16.127 --> 00:15:19.144
I put out notices in papers saying,

00:15:19.144 --> 00:15:22.564
if you are a British grandmother, if you have broadband and a web camera,

00:15:22.564 --> 00:15:25.791
can you give me one hour of your time per week for free?

00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:27.903
I got 200 in the first two weeks.

00:15:27.903 --> 00:15:32.811
I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe. (Laughter)

00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:36.626
They're called the Granny Cloud.

00:15:36.626 --> 00:15:38.356
The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet.

00:15:38.356 --> 00:15:42.730
If there's a child in trouble, we beam a Gran.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.299
She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out.

00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:49.918
I've seen them do it from a village called Diggles

00:15:49.918 --> 00:15:51.963
in northwestern England,

00:15:51.963 --> 00:15:55.267
deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu, India,

00:15:55.267 --> 00:15:57.507
6,000 miles away.

00:15:57.507 --> 00:16:01.083
She does it with only one age-old gesture.

00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:02.798
"Shhh."

00:16:02.798 --> 00:16:05.523
Okay?

00:16:05.523 --> 00:16:07.059
Watch this.

00:16:07.059 --> 00:16:11.315
Grandmother: You can't catch me. You say it.

00:16:11.315 --> 00:16:15.083
You can't catch me.

00:16:15.083 --> 00:16:18.051
Children: You can't catch me.

00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:23.633
Grandmother: I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children: I'm the Gingerbread Man.

00:16:23.633 --> 00:16:28.223
Grandmother: Well done! Very good.

00:16:28.223 --> 00:16:30.681
SM: So what's happening here?

00:16:30.681 --> 00:16:32.525
I think what we need to look at is

00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:34.906
we need to look at learning

00:16:34.906 --> 00:16:39.494
as the product of educational self-organization.

00:16:39.494 --> 00:16:42.339
If you allow the educational process to self-organize,

00:16:42.339 --> 00:16:44.830
then learning emerges.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.223
It's not about making learning happen.

00:16:47.223 --> 00:16:49.439
It's about letting it happen.

00:16:49.439 --> 00:16:52.712
The teacher sets the process in motion

00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:55.431
and then she stands back in awe

00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:57.799
and watches as learning happens.

00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:00.752
I think that's what all this is pointing at.

00:17:00.752 --> 00:17:03.504
But how will we know? How will we come to know?

00:17:03.504 --> 00:17:05.179
Well, I intend to build

00:17:05.179 --> 00:17:08.480
these Self-Organized Learning Environments.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.165
They are basically broadband, collaboration

00:17:12.165 --> 00:17:14.558
and encouragement put together.

00:17:14.558 --> 00:17:16.264
I've tried this in many, many schools.

00:17:16.264 --> 00:17:18.799
It's been tried all over the world, and teachers

00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:22.425
sort of stand back and say, "It just happens by itself?"

00:17:22.425 --> 00:17:25.542
And I said, "Yeah, it happens by itself.""How did you know that?"

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:29.035
I said, "You won't believe the children who told me

00:17:29.035 --> 00:17:31.963
and where they're from."

00:17:31.963 --> 00:17:34.707
Here's a SOLE in action.

00:17:34.707 --> 00:17:40.816
(Children talking)

00:17:40.816 --> 00:17:47.105
This one is in England.

00:17:47.105 --> 00:17:50.871
He maintains law and order,

00:17:50.871 --> 00:17:59.386
because remember, there's no teacher around.

00:18:01.356 --> 00:18:05.259
Girl: The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons -- SM: Australia

00:18:05.259 --> 00:18:11.994
Girl: -- giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge.

00:18:11.994 --> 00:18:15.578
The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons

00:18:15.578 --> 00:18:18.871
in the ion minus the number of electrons.

00:18:18.871 --> 00:18:21.920
SM: A decade ahead of her time.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.523
So SOLEs, I think we need a curriculum of big questions.

00:18:25.523 --> 00:18:27.729
You already heard about that. You know what that means.

00:18:27.729 --> 00:18:31.130
There was a time when Stone Age men and women

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.234
used to sit and look up at the sky and say,

00:18:33.234 --> 00:18:35.713
"What are those twinkling lights?"

00:18:35.713 --> 00:18:40.507
They built the first curriculum, but we've lost sight of those wondrous questions.

00:18:40.507 --> 00:18:44.637
We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle.

00:18:44.637 --> 00:18:48.345
But that's not sexy enough.

00:18:48.345 --> 00:18:51.306
The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say,

00:18:51.306 --> 00:18:54.459
"If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth,

00:18:54.459 --> 00:18:57.857
how would you figure out if it was going to or not?"

00:18:57.857 --> 00:19:00.417
And if he says, "Well, what? how?"

00:19:00.417 --> 00:19:03.402
you say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle,"

00:19:03.402 --> 00:19:06.273
and leave him alone. He'll figure it out.

00:19:06.273 --> 00:19:10.731
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs.

00:19:10.731 --> 00:19:16.320
I've tried incredible, incredible questions --

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.608
"When did the world begin? How will it end?" —

00:19:20.608 --> 00:19:22.553
to nine-year-olds.

00:19:22.553 --> 00:19:25.529
This one is about what happens to the air we breathe.

00:19:25.529 --> 00:19:30.487
This is done by children without the help of any teacher.

00:19:30.487 --> 00:19:32.871
The teacher only raises the question,

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:36.535
and then stands back and admires the answer.

00:19:36.535 --> 00:19:40.271
So what's my wish?

00:19:40.271 --> 00:19:42.487
My wish is

00:19:42.487 --> 00:19:46.801
that we design the future of learning.

00:19:46.801 --> 00:19:48.767
We don't want to be spare parts

00:19:48.767 --> 00:19:51.159
for a great human computer, do we?

00:19:51.159 --> 00:19:54.815
So we need to design a future for learning.

00:19:54.815 --> 00:19:56.451
And I've got to -- hang on,

00:19:56.451 --> 00:19:59.151
I've got to get this wording exactly right,

00:19:59.151 --> 00:20:01.795
because, you know, it's very important.

00:20:01.795 --> 00:20:04.111
My wish is to help design a future of learning

00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:06.345
by supporting children all over the world

00:20:06.345 --> 00:20:09.391
to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together.

00:20:09.391 --> 00:20:11.623
Help me build this school.

00:20:11.623 --> 00:20:14.959
It will be called the School in the Cloud.

00:20:14.959 --> 00:20:20.032
It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures

00:20:20.032 --> 00:20:23.889
driven by the big questions which their mediators put in.

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:26.160
The way I want to do this

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.520
is to build a facility where I can study this.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.320
It's a facility which is practically unmanned.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.087
There's only one granny

00:20:35.087 --> 00:20:37.528
who manages health and safety.

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:38.961
The rest of it's from the cloud.

00:20:38.961 --> 00:20:40.876
The lights are turned on and off by the cloud,

00:20:40.876 --> 00:20:42.904
etc., etc., everything's done from the cloud.

00:20:42.904 --> 00:20:46.129
But I want you for another purpose.

00:20:46.129 --> 00:20:48.888
You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments

00:20:48.888 --> 00:20:53.904
at home, in the school, outside of school, in clubs.

00:20:53.904 --> 00:20:56.032
It's very easy to do. There's a great document

00:20:56.032 --> 00:20:57.920
produced by TED which tells you how to do it.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.296
If you would please, please do it

00:21:01.296 --> 00:21:03.661
across all five continents

00:21:03.661 --> 00:21:05.872
and send me the data,

00:21:05.872 --> 00:21:09.376
then I'll put it all together, move it into the School of Clouds,

00:21:09.376 --> 00:21:12.640
and create the future of learning.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.432
That's my wish.

00:21:14.432 --> 00:21:15.855
And just one last thing.

00:21:15.855 --> 00:21:18.448
I'll take you to the top of the Himalayas.

00:21:18.448 --> 00:21:21.751
At 12,000 feet, where the air is thin,

00:21:21.751 --> 00:21:24.736
I once built two Hole in the Wall computers,

00:21:24.736 --> 00:21:26.191
and the children flocked there.

00:21:26.191 --> 00:21:29.088
And there was this little girl who was following me around.

00:21:29.088 --> 00:21:33.804
And I said to her, "You know, I want to give a computer to everybody, every child.

00:21:33.804 --> 00:21:36.205
I don't know, what should I do?"

00:21:36.205 --> 00:21:40.236
And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly.

00:21:40.236 --> 00:21:44.292
She suddenly raised her hand like this, and said to me,

00:21:44.292 --> 00:21:46.181
"Get on with it."

00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:58.045
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:21:58.045 --> 00:21:59.906
I think it was good advice.

00:21:59.906 --> 00:22:01.974
I'll follow her advice. I'll stop talking.

00:22:01.974 --> 00:22:05.964
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:22:05.964 --> 00:22:09.715
(Applause)

00:22:09.715 --> 00:22:18.039
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:24.454
Thank you very much. Wow. (Applause)
