00:00:12.976 --> 00:00:14.370
As a conceptual artist,

00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:18.702
I'm constantly looking for creative ways
to spark challenging conversations.

00:00:18.726 --> 00:00:22.425
I do this though painting, sculpture,
video and performance.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.888
But regardless of the format,

00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:27.364
two of my favorite materials
are history and dialogue.

00:00:27.796 --> 00:00:30.235
In 2007, I created "Lotus,"

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.033
a seven-and-a-half-foot diameter,

00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:35.612
600-pound glass depiction
of a lotus blossom.

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:39.406
In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol
for transcendence

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.858
and for purity of mind and spirit.

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:44.303
But a closer look at this lotus

00:00:44.327 --> 00:00:47.541
reveals each petal
to be the cross-section of a slave ship.

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:51.660
This iconic diagram was taken
from a British slaving manual

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:55.517
and later used by abolitionists to show
the atrocities of slavery.

00:00:56.104 --> 00:00:58.509
In America, we don't like
to talk about slavery,

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.373
nor do we look at it as a global industry.

00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:03.025
But by using this Buddhist symbol,

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.652
I hope to universalize and transcend

00:01:05.676 --> 00:01:08.065
the history and trauma of black America

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:11.453
and encourage discussions
about our shared past.

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:16.128
To create "Lotus,"
we carved over 6,000 figures.

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:19.192
And this later led to a commission
by the City of New York

00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:21.470
to create a 28-foot version in steel

00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:24.936
as a permanent installation
at the Eagle Academy for Young Men,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.098
a school for black and latino students,

00:01:27.122 --> 00:01:29.795
the two groups most affected
by this history.

00:01:30.244 --> 00:01:33.795
The same two groups are very affected
by a more recent phenomenon,

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.442
but let me digress.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.007
I've been collecting
wooden African figures

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.515
from tourist shops and flea markets
around the world.

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.621
The authenticity and origin
of them is completely debatable,

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:46.303
but people believe these
to be imbued with power,

00:01:46.327 --> 00:01:47.659
or even magic.

00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:50.809
Only recently have I figured out
how to use this in my own work.

00:01:51.412 --> 00:01:58.221
(Gun shots)

00:02:05.253 --> 00:02:09.421
Since 2012, the world has witnessed
the killings of Trayvon Martin,

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:13.185
Michael Brown, Eric Garner,
Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.169
and literally countless other
unarmed black citizens

00:02:16.193 --> 00:02:17.622
at the hands of the police,

00:02:17.646 --> 00:02:20.454
who frequently walk away
with no punishment at all.

00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:22.804
In consideration of these victims

00:02:22.828 --> 00:02:24.638
and the several times that even I,

00:02:24.662 --> 00:02:27.135
a law-abiding, Ivy League professor,

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.623
have been targeted and harassed
at gunpoint by the police.

00:02:30.647 --> 00:02:34.301
I created this body of work
simply entitled "BAM."

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.888
It was important to erase
the identity of each of these figures,

00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:43.661
to make them all look the same
and easier to disregard.

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:45.885
To do this, I dip them in a thick,
brown wax

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.872
before taking them to a shooting range

00:02:47.896 --> 00:02:50.694
where I re-sculpted them using bullets.

00:02:51.098 --> 00:02:52.279
And it was fun,

00:02:52.303 --> 00:02:55.140
playing with big guns and
high-speed video cameras.

00:02:55.164 --> 00:02:58.821
But my reverence for these figures
kept me from actually pulling the trigger,

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.503
somehow feeling as if I would
be shooting myself.

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:05.225
Finally, my cameraman, Raul,
fired the shots.

00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:08.372
I then took the fragments of these

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:11.924
and created molds,
and cast them first in wax,

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.852
and finally in bronze
like the image you see here,

00:03:15.876 --> 00:03:17.980
which bears the marks
of its violent creation

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:19.812
like battle wounds or scars.

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:22.591
When I showed this work recently in Miami,

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:25.400
a woman told me she felt
every gun shot to her soul.

00:03:25.424 --> 00:03:28.015
But she also felt that these artworks

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:30.039
memorialized the victims of these killings

00:03:30.063 --> 00:03:33.252
as well as other victims of
racial violence throughout US history.

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:36.846
But "Lotus" and "BAM" are larger
than just US history.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.734
While showing in Berlin last year,

00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:42.319
a philosophy student asked me
what prompted these recent killings.

00:03:42.343 --> 00:03:44.961
I showed him a photo
of a lynching postcard

00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:46.350
from the early 1900s

00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:51.446
and reminded him that these killings
have been going on for over 500 years.

00:03:51.922 --> 00:03:53.828
But it's only through questions like his

00:03:53.852 --> 00:03:56.694
and more thoughtful dialogue
about history and race

00:03:56.718 --> 00:03:59.296
can we evolve as individuals and society.

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.542
I hope my artwork creates a safe space

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:04.978
for this type of honest exchange

00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:07.741
and an opportunity for people
to engage one another

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:10.653
in real and necessary conversation.

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:11.901
Thank you.

00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:18.388
(Applause)
