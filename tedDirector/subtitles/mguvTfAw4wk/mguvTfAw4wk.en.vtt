00:00:12.727 --> 00:00:13.939
Loneliness.

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:17.646
All of us in this room
will experience loneliness

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.032
at some point in our lives.

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:22.120
Loneliness is not
a function of being alone,

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:25.468
but rather, a function
of how socially connected you are

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:26.653
to those around you.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.973
There could be somebody
in this room right now

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:31.534
surrounded by a thousand people

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:32.912
experiencing loneliness.

00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:38.757
And while loneliness
can be attributed to many things,

00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:40.512
as an architect,

00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:43.473
I'm going to tell you today
how loneliness can be the result

00:00:43.497 --> 00:00:45.453
of our built environments --

00:00:45.477 --> 00:00:47.387
the very homes we choose to live in.

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:50.881
Let's take a look at this house.

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:52.560
It's a nice house.

00:00:52.584 --> 00:00:54.999
There's a big yard, picket fence,

00:00:55.023 --> 00:00:56.224
two-car garage.

00:00:58.018 --> 00:01:00.574
And the home might be
in a neighborhood like this.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.900
And for many people around the globe,

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:06.144
this home, this neighborhood --

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:08.065
it's a dream.

00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:11.519
And yet the danger of achieving this dream

00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:13.245
is a false sense of connection

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:16.540
and an increase in social isolation.

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:18.708
I know, I can hear you now,

00:01:18.732 --> 00:01:22.059
there's somebody in the room
screaming at me inside their head,

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:24.374
"That's my house,
and that's my neighborhood,

00:01:24.398 --> 00:01:26.071
and I know everyone on my block!"

00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:29.175
To which I would answer, "Terrific!"

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:31.345
And I wish there were
more people like you,

00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:35.354
because I'd wager to guess
there's more people in the room

00:01:35.378 --> 00:01:37.100
living in a similar situation

00:01:37.124 --> 00:01:39.009
that might not know their neighbors.

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.277
They might recognize them and say hello,

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.641
but under their breath,

00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:47.039
they're asking their spouse,

00:01:47.063 --> 00:01:48.461
"What was their name again?"

00:01:49.413 --> 00:01:52.494
so they can ask a question by name
to signify they know them.

00:01:54.975 --> 00:01:59.474
Social media also contributes
to this false sense of connection.

00:01:59.498 --> 00:02:01.496
This image is probably all too familiar.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.089
You're standing in the elevator,

00:02:03.113 --> 00:02:04.267
sitting in a cafe,

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:05.927
and you look around,

00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:07.395
and everyone's on their phone.

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:11.098
You're not texting or checking Facebook,

00:02:11.122 --> 00:02:12.529
but everyone else is,

00:02:12.553 --> 00:02:14.772
and maybe, like me,
you've been in a situation

00:02:14.796 --> 00:02:16.680
where you've made eye contact,

00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:18.997
smiled and said hello,

00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:21.712
and have that person
yank out their earbuds

00:02:22.354 --> 00:02:24.347
and say, "I'm sorry, what did you say?"

00:02:25.697 --> 00:02:27.715
I find this incredibly isolating.

00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:30.505
The concept I'd like
to share with you today

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:32.113
is an antidote to isolation.

00:02:32.523 --> 00:02:33.774
It's not a new concept.

00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:35.901
In fact, it's an age-old way of living,

00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:38.405
and it still exists in many
non-European cultures

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:39.656
around the world.

00:02:40.337 --> 00:02:42.215
And about 50 years ago,

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.356
the Danes decided to make up a new name,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.538
and since then,

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:50.659
tens of thousands of Danish people
have been living in this connected way.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.658
And it's being pursued
more widely around the globe

00:02:55.682 --> 00:02:57.962
as people are seeking community.

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:00.511
This concept

00:03:01.638 --> 00:03:02.838
is cohousing.

00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.694
Cohousing is an intentional neighborhood
where people know each other

00:03:08.718 --> 00:03:10.069
and look after one another.

00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:13.228
In cohousing, you have your own home,

00:03:13.252 --> 00:03:16.389
but you also share significant spaces,
both indoors and out.

00:03:16.857 --> 00:03:19.179
Before I show you
some pictures of cohousing,

00:03:19.203 --> 00:03:22.295
I'd like to first introduce you
to my friends Sheila and Spencer.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.251
When I first met Sheila and Spencer,
they were just entering their 60s,

00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:29.002
and Spencer was looking ahead
at the end of a long career

00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:30.260
in elementary education.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:32.513
And he really disliked the idea

00:03:32.537 --> 00:03:35.050
that he might not have
children in his life

00:03:35.074 --> 00:03:36.263
upon retirement.

00:03:38.873 --> 00:03:40.294
They're now my neighbors.

00:03:40.318 --> 00:03:43.332
We live in a cohousing community
that I not only designed,

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.520
but developed

00:03:44.544 --> 00:03:46.368
and have my architecture practice in.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.306
This community is very intentional
about our social interactions.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.845
So let me take you on a tour.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:56.531
From the outside, we look like
any other small apartment building.

00:03:56.555 --> 00:03:59.213
In fact, we look identical
to the one next door,

00:03:59.237 --> 00:04:00.901
except that we're bright yellow.

00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:04.472
Inside, the homes are fairly conventional.

00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:07.009
We all have living rooms and kitchens,

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:08.931
bedrooms and baths,

00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:12.347
and there are nine of these homes
around a central courtyard.

00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:13.540
This one's mine,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.056
and this one is Spencer and Sheila's.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:19.392
The thing that makes this building
uniquely cohousing

00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:20.698
are not the homes,

00:04:21.563 --> 00:04:23.430
but rather, what happens here --

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.075
the social interactions that happen
in and around that central courtyard.

00:04:28.728 --> 00:04:30.414
When I look across the courtyard,

00:04:30.438 --> 00:04:32.453
I look forward to see Spencer and Sheila.

00:04:32.477 --> 00:04:34.513
In fact, every morning,
this is what I see,

00:04:34.537 --> 00:04:37.754
Spencer waving at me furiously
as we're making our breakfasts.

00:04:38.884 --> 00:04:41.374
From our homes, we look down
into the courtyard,

00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.750
and depending on the time of year,

00:04:43.774 --> 00:04:45.123
we see this:

00:04:45.147 --> 00:04:48.553
kids and grownups in various combinations

00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:50.941
playing and hanging out with each other.

00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:53.275
There's a lot of giggling and chatter.

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:54.934
There's a lot of hula-hooping.

00:04:55.887 --> 00:04:59.447
And every now and then,
"Hey, quit hitting me!"

00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:01.953
or a cry from one of the kids.

00:05:01.977 --> 00:05:04.288
These are the sounds of our daily lives,

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:07.526
and the sounds of social connectedness.

00:05:08.296 --> 00:05:11.687
At the bottom of the courtyard,
there are a set of double doors,

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:13.776
and those lead into the common house.

00:05:14.323 --> 00:05:18.179
I consider the common house
the secret sauce of cohousing.

00:05:18.203 --> 00:05:19.366
It's the secret sauce

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.264
because it's the place
where the social interactions

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:24.810
and community life begin,

00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:28.493
and from there, it radiates out
through the rest of the community.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.047
Inside our common house,
we have a large dining room

00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:36.653
to seat all 28 of us and our guests,

00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:38.851
and we dine together three times a week.

00:05:39.978 --> 00:05:42.769
In support of those meals,
we have a large kitchen

00:05:42.793 --> 00:05:45.288
so that we can take turns
cooking for each other

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:46.550
in teams of three.

00:05:46.574 --> 00:05:48.773
So that means, with 17 adults,

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:52.368
I lead cook once every six weeks.

00:05:52.392 --> 00:05:54.770
Two other times, I show up
and help my team

00:05:54.794 --> 00:05:56.591
with the preparation and cleanup.

00:05:56.615 --> 00:05:58.180
And all those other nights,

00:05:58.204 --> 00:05:59.441
I just show up.

00:06:00.243 --> 00:06:02.695
I have dinner, talk with my neighbors,

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:05.064
and I go home, having been fed
a delicious meal

00:06:05.088 --> 00:06:07.932
by someone who cares
about my vegetarian preferences.

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:13.397
Our nine families
have intentionally chosen

00:06:13.421 --> 00:06:14.942
an alternative way of living.

00:06:15.655 --> 00:06:17.775
Instead of pursuing the American dream,

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:20.697
where we might have been isolated
in our single-family homes,

00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:22.388
we instead chose cohousing,

00:06:23.287 --> 00:06:25.550
so that we can increase
our social connections.

00:06:26.197 --> 00:06:28.059
And that's how cohousing starts:

00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:29.737
with a shared intention

00:06:29.761 --> 00:06:31.245
to live collaboratively.

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:34.148
And intention is the single most
important characteristic

00:06:34.172 --> 00:06:37.231
that differentiates cohousing
from any other housing model.

00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:40.590
And while intention is difficult to see

00:06:40.614 --> 00:06:42.444
or even show,

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:45.412
I'm an architect, and I can't help
but show you more pictures.

00:06:45.436 --> 00:06:47.502
So here are a few examples to illustrate

00:06:47.526 --> 00:06:49.810
how intention has been expressed

00:06:49.834 --> 00:06:51.946
in some of the communities I've visited.

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:56.517
Through the careful
selection of furniture,

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.971
lighting and acoustic materials
to support eating together;

00:07:01.876 --> 00:07:04.290
in the careful visual location
and visual access

00:07:05.032 --> 00:07:08.750
to kids' play areas around
and inside the common house;

00:07:11.218 --> 00:07:13.557
in the consideration of scale

00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:16.368
and distribution of social gathering nodes

00:07:16.392 --> 00:07:19.709
in and around the community
to support our daily lives,

00:07:19.733 --> 00:07:23.079
all of these spaces help
contribute to and elevate

00:07:23.103 --> 00:07:24.421
the sense of communitas

00:07:24.445 --> 00:07:25.784
in each community.

00:07:26.893 --> 00:07:28.720
What was that word? "Communitas."

00:07:29.937 --> 00:07:34.661
Communitas is a fancy social science way
of saying "spirit of community."

00:07:35.585 --> 00:07:38.047
And in visiting
over 80 different communities,

00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:40.527
my measure of communitas became:

00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:43.369
How frequently did residents eat together?

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:46.767
While it's completely up to each group

00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:48.854
how frequently they have common meals,

00:07:50.226 --> 00:07:53.265
I know some that have eaten together
every single night

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:55.141
for the past 40 years.

00:07:56.118 --> 00:07:57.329
I know others

00:07:58.059 --> 00:08:00.611
that have an occasional potluck
once or twice a month.

00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:03.565
And from my observations, I can tell you,

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:05.678
those that eat together more frequently,

00:08:05.702 --> 00:08:08.447
exhibit higher levels of communitas.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.786
It turns out, when you eat together,

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.973
you start planning
more activities together.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.193
When you eat together,
you share more things.

00:08:18.217 --> 00:08:20.001
You start to watch each other's kids.

00:08:20.025 --> 00:08:22.940
You lend our your power tools.
You borrow each other's cars.

00:08:22.964 --> 00:08:24.285
And despite all this,

00:08:25.398 --> 00:08:26.915
as my daughter loves to say,

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:30.387
everything is not rainbows
and unicorns in cohousing,

00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:34.878
and I'm not best friends
with every single person in my community.

00:08:34.902 --> 00:08:37.321
We even have differences and conflicts.

00:08:39.234 --> 00:08:42.632
But living in cohousing,
we're intentional about our relationships.

00:08:43.505 --> 00:08:45.916
We're motivated
to resolve our differences.

00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:48.655
We follow up, we check in,

00:08:49.266 --> 00:08:51.360
we speak our personal truths

00:08:51.384 --> 00:08:52.723
and, when appropriate,

00:08:53.552 --> 00:08:54.773
we apologize.

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:59.942
Skeptics will say that cohousing
is only interesting or attractive

00:08:59.966 --> 00:09:01.551
to a very small group of people.

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:03.708
And I'll agree with that.

00:09:04.468 --> 00:09:06.809
If you look at Western cultures
around the globe,

00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:09.549
those living in cohousing
are just a fractional percent.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.100
But that needs to change,

00:09:12.992 --> 00:09:15.075
because our very lives depend upon it.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.323
In 2015, Brigham Young University
completed a study

00:09:20.347 --> 00:09:25.076
that showed a significant
increase risk of premature death

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.236
in those who were living in isolation.

00:09:28.725 --> 00:09:31.119
The US Surgeon General
has declared isolation

00:09:31.143 --> 00:09:32.710
to be a public health epidemic.

00:09:33.244 --> 00:09:36.834
And this epidemic
is not restricted to the US alone.

00:09:38.999 --> 00:09:41.073
So when I said earlier

00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:43.975
that cohousing
is an antidote to isolation,

00:09:45.587 --> 00:09:47.208
what I should have said

00:09:47.232 --> 00:09:50.386
is that cohousing can save your life.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.619
If I was a doctor, I would tell you
to take two aspirin,

00:09:55.643 --> 00:09:57.002
and call me in the morning.

00:09:58.356 --> 00:09:59.675
But as an architect,

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:02.730
I'm going to suggest
that you take a walk with your neighbor,

00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:04.213
share a meal together,

00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:06.795
and call me in 20 years.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.108
Thank you.

00:10:09.132 --> 00:10:12.899
(Applause)
