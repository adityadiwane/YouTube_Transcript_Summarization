00:00:15.358 --> 00:00:18.419
So I have bad news, I have good news,

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:20.284
and I have a task.

00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:23.227
So the bad news is that we all get sick.

00:00:23.227 --> 00:00:25.499
I get sick. You get sick.

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.041
And every one of us gets sick, and the question really is,

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:30.918
how sick do we get? Is it something that kills us?

00:00:30.918 --> 00:00:32.263
Is it something that we survive?

00:00:32.263 --> 00:00:34.191
Is it something that we can treat?

00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:37.447
And we've gotten sick as long as we've been people.

00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:40.933
And so we've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick.

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.890
And for a long time, it was the gods, right?

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.044
The gods are angry with me, or the gods are testing me,

00:00:46.044 --> 00:00:48.460
right? Or God, singular, more recently,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.124
is punishing me or judging me.

00:00:51.124 --> 00:00:53.804
And as long as we've looked for explanations,

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:57.515
we've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science,

00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:00.004
which is hypotheses as to why we get sick,

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:04.744
and as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick, we've tried to treat it as well.

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:08.777
So this is Avicenna. He wrote a book over a thousand years ago called "The Canon of Medicine,"

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:11.183
and the rules he laid out for testing medicines

00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:12.972
are actually really similar to the rules we have today,

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.917
that the disease and the medicine must be the same strength,

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:18.314
the medicine needs to be pure, and in the end we need

00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:21.455
to test it in people. And so if you put together these themes

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:25.920
of a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.576
right, you get some beautiful results,

00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:30.018
even when we didn't have very good technologies.

00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:33.080
This is a guy named Carlos Finlay. He had a hypothesis

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.985
that was way outside the box for his time, in the late 1800s.

00:01:35.985 --> 00:01:38.833
He thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing.

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:41.259
He thought it was transmitted by mosquitos.

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.621
And they laughed at him. For 20 years, they called this guy

00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:47.110
"the mosquito man." But he ran an experiment in people,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.213
right? He had this hypothesis, and he tested it in people.

00:01:50.213 --> 00:01:54.855
So he got volunteers to go move to Cuba and live in tents

00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:57.890
and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.912
So some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:02.131
and some of the people were in tents that were full

00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:04.387
of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever.

00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:07.788
And it definitively proved that it wasn't this magic dust

00:02:07.788 --> 00:02:11.210
called fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.586
But it wasn't until we tested it in people that we actually knew.

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:16.545
And this is what those people signed up for.

00:02:16.545 --> 00:02:19.635
This is what it looked like to have yellow fever in Cuba

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:24.169
at that time. You suffered in a tent, in the heat, alone,

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.865
and you probably died.

00:02:26.865 --> 00:02:30.082
But people volunteered for this.

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:33.393
And it's not just a cool example of a scientific design

00:02:33.393 --> 00:02:36.306
of experiment in theory. They also did this beautiful thing.

00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:40.225
They signed this document, and it's called an informed consent document.

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:42.738
And informed consent is an idea that we should be

00:02:42.738 --> 00:02:44.964
very proud of as a society, right? It's something that

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:47.730
separates us from the Nazis at Nuremberg,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.605
enforced medical experimentation. It's the idea

00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:54.393
that agreement to join a study without understanding isn't agreement.

00:02:54.393 --> 00:02:58.502
It's something that protects us from harm, from hucksters,

00:02:58.502 --> 00:03:01.355
from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical

00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:05.107
study that we don't understand, or that we don't agree to.

00:03:05.107 --> 00:03:09.436
And so you put together the thread of narrative hypothesis,

00:03:09.436 --> 00:03:12.033
experimentation in humans, and informed consent,

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:14.698
and you get what we call clinical study, and it's how we do

00:03:14.698 --> 00:03:17.713
the vast majority of medical work. It doesn't really matter

00:03:17.713 --> 00:03:20.055
if you're in the north, the south, the east, the west.

00:03:20.055 --> 00:03:24.168
Clinical studies form the basis of how we investigate,

00:03:24.168 --> 00:03:26.027
so if we're going to look at a new drug, right,

00:03:26.027 --> 00:03:29.025
we test it in people, we draw blood, we do experiments,

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:31.354
and we gain consent for that study, to make sure

00:03:31.354 --> 00:03:34.003
that we're not screwing people over as part of it.

00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:37.667
But the world is changing around the clinical study,

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:41.033
which has been fairly well established for tens of years

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:42.933
if not 50 to 100 years.

00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:45.984
So now we're able to gather data about our genomes,

00:03:45.984 --> 00:03:48.844
but, as we saw earlier, our genomes aren't dispositive.

00:03:48.844 --> 00:03:51.610
We're able to gather information about our environment.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.520
And more importantly, we're able to gather information

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.360
about our choices, because it turns out that what we think of

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.080
as our health is more like the interaction of our bodies,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.729
our genomes, our choices and our environment.

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.473
And the clinical methods that we've got aren't very good

00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:08.105
at studying that because they are based on the idea

00:04:08.105 --> 00:04:10.019
of person-to-person interaction. You interact

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.114
with your doctor and you get enrolled in the study.

00:04:12.114 --> 00:04:14.729
So this is my grandfather. I actually never met him,

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:18.524
but he's holding my mom, and his genes are in me, right?

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:21.415
His choices ran through to me. He was a smoker,

00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:23.999
like most people were. This is my son.

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:27.441
So my grandfather's genes go all the way through to him,

00:04:27.441 --> 00:04:29.993
and my choices are going to affect his health.

00:04:29.993 --> 00:04:32.687
The technology between these two pictures

00:04:32.687 --> 00:04:36.360
cannot be more different, but the methodology

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.484
for clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period.

00:04:40.484 --> 00:04:43.152
We just have better statistics.

00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:46.604
The way we gain informed consent was formed in large part

00:04:46.604 --> 00:04:49.195
after World War II, around the time that picture was taken.

00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:53.129
That was 70 years ago, and the way we gain informed consent,

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.006
this tool that was created to protect us from harm,

00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:59.672
now creates silos. So the data that we collect

00:04:59.672 --> 00:05:02.398
for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's trials

00:05:02.398 --> 00:05:05.013
goes into silos where it can only be used

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:08.237
for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's research.

00:05:08.237 --> 00:05:11.131
Right? It can't be networked. It can't be integrated.

00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:14.664
It cannot be used by people who aren't credentialed.

00:05:14.664 --> 00:05:17.617
So a physicist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:20.685
A computer scientist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.

00:05:20.685 --> 00:05:24.828
Computer scientists aren't patient. They don't file paperwork.

00:05:24.828 --> 00:05:28.814
And this is an accident. These are tools that we created

00:05:28.814 --> 00:05:32.081
to protect us from harm, but what they're doing

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.611
is protecting us from innovation now.

00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:37.876
And that wasn't the goal. It wasn't the point. Right?

00:05:37.876 --> 00:05:40.575
It's a side effect, if you will, of a power we created

00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:42.934
to take us for good.

00:05:42.934 --> 00:05:46.078
And so if you think about it, the depressing thing is that

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:48.211
Facebook would never make a change to something

00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:50.782
as important as an advertising algorithm

00:05:50.782 --> 00:05:55.193
with a sample size as small as a Phase III clinical trial.

00:05:55.193 --> 00:05:58.855
We cannot take the information from past trials

00:05:58.855 --> 00:06:03.009
and put them together to form statistically significant samples.

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.493
And that sucks, right? So 45 percent of men develop

00:06:06.493 --> 00:06:09.590
cancer. Thirty-eight percent of women develop cancer.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.934
One in four men dies of cancer.

00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:15.490
One in five women dies of cancer, at least in the United States.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.718
And three out of the four drugs we give you

00:06:17.718 --> 00:06:21.231
if you get cancer fail. And this is personal to me.

00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:23.194
My sister is a cancer survivor.

00:06:23.194 --> 00:06:26.783
My mother-in-law is a cancer survivor. Cancer sucks.

00:06:26.783 --> 00:06:28.973
And when you have it, you don't have a lot of privacy

00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:32.460
in the hospital. You're naked the vast majority of the time.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.155
People you don't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you,

00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:39.596
and when I tell cancer survivors that this tool we created

00:06:39.596 --> 00:06:42.694
to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used,

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.744
especially when only three to four percent of people

00:06:44.744 --> 00:06:47.542
who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study,

00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:51.100
their reaction is not, "Thank you, God, for protecting my privacy."

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.797
It's outrage

00:06:53.797 --> 00:06:55.922
that we have this information and we can't use it.

00:06:55.922 --> 00:06:58.398
And it's an accident.

00:06:58.398 --> 00:07:01.453
So the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous.

00:07:01.453 --> 00:07:05.108
Two hundred and twenty-six billion a year is spent on cancer in the United States.

00:07:05.108 --> 00:07:08.327
Fifteen hundred people a day die in the United States.

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:10.900
And it's getting worse.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.882
So the good news is that some things have changed,

00:07:13.882 --> 00:07:15.435
and the most important thing that's changed

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.773
is that we can now measure ourselves in ways

00:07:17.773 --> 00:07:20.831
that used to be the dominion of the health system.

00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:22.989
So a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust.

00:07:22.989 --> 00:07:26.031
I like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid.

00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:28.407
We can reach back and grab that dust,

00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:30.821
and we can learn a lot about health from it, so if our choices

00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:33.501
are part of our health, what we eat is a really important

00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:36.190
aspect of our health. So you can do something very simple

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.147
and basic and take a picture of your food,

00:07:38.147 --> 00:07:41.031
and if enough people do that, we can learn a lot about

00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:42.456
how our food affects our health.

00:07:42.456 --> 00:07:46.972
One interesting thing that came out of this — this is an app for iPhones called The Eatery —

00:07:46.972 --> 00:07:49.462
is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier

00:07:49.462 --> 00:07:52.900
than other people's pizza is. Okay? (Laughter)

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.508
And it seems like a trivial result, but this is the sort of research

00:07:56.508 --> 00:07:58.822
that used to take the health system years

00:07:58.822 --> 00:08:01.115
and hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish.

00:08:01.115 --> 00:08:04.839
It was done in five months by a startup company of a couple of people.

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:07.463
I don't have any financial interest in it.

00:08:07.463 --> 00:08:10.159
But more nontrivially, we can get our genotypes done,

00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:12.977
and although our genotypes aren't dispositive, they give us clues.

00:08:12.977 --> 00:08:15.783
So I could show you mine. It's just A's, T's, C's and G's.

00:08:15.783 --> 00:08:18.015
This is the interpretation of it. As you can see,

00:08:18.015 --> 00:08:20.615
I carry a 32 percent risk of prostate cancer,

00:08:20.615 --> 00:08:24.838
22 percent risk of psoriasis and a 14 percent risk of Alzheimer's disease.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.445
So that means, if you're a geneticist, you're freaking out,

00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:31.479
going, "Oh my God, you told everyone you carry the ApoE E4 allele. What's wrong with you?"

00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:35.167
Right? When I got these results, I started talking to doctors,

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:37.576
and they told me not to tell anyone, and my reaction is,

00:08:37.576 --> 00:08:40.864
"Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease?"

00:08:40.864 --> 00:08:43.928
And no one could tell me yes.

00:08:43.928 --> 00:08:46.734
And I live in a web world where, when you share things,

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:49.444
beautiful stuff happens, not bad stuff.

00:08:49.444 --> 00:08:51.344
So I started putting this in my slide decks,

00:08:51.344 --> 00:08:53.805
and I got even more obnoxious, and I went to my doctor,

00:08:53.805 --> 00:08:55.787
and I said, "I'd like to actually get my bloodwork.

00:08:55.787 --> 00:08:58.577
Please give me back my data." So this is my most recent bloodwork.

00:08:58.577 --> 00:09:00.946
As you can see, I have high cholesterol.

00:09:00.946 --> 00:09:03.697
I have particularly high bad cholesterol, and I have some

00:09:03.697 --> 00:09:06.700
bad liver numbers, but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.409
the night before we ran the test. (Laughter)

00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:13.822
Right. But look at how non-computable this information is.

00:09:13.822 --> 00:09:16.796
This is like the photograph of my granddad holding my mom

00:09:16.796 --> 00:09:20.395
from a data perspective, and I had to go into the system

00:09:20.395 --> 00:09:22.557
and get it out.

00:09:22.557 --> 00:09:25.839
So the thing that I'm proposing we do here

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:28.255
is that we reach behind us and we grab the dust,

00:09:28.255 --> 00:09:31.233
that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype,

00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:33.934
and we reach into the medical system and we grab our records,

00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:37.374
and we use it to build something together, which is a commons.

00:09:37.374 --> 00:09:40.518
And there's been a lot of talk about commonses, right,

00:09:40.518 --> 00:09:43.466
here, there, everywhere, right. A commons is nothing more

00:09:43.466 --> 00:09:46.394
than a public good that we build out of private goods.

00:09:46.394 --> 00:09:49.163
We do it voluntarily, and we do it through standardized

00:09:49.163 --> 00:09:51.963
legal tools. We do it through standardized technologies.

00:09:51.963 --> 00:09:55.234
Right. That's all a commons is. It's something that we build

00:09:55.234 --> 00:09:57.754
together because we think it's important.

00:09:57.754 --> 00:10:00.386
And a commons of data is something that's really unique,

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:03.254
because we make it from our own data. And although

00:10:03.254 --> 00:10:05.541
a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control

00:10:05.541 --> 00:10:07.796
around data, and obsess around privacy, at least

00:10:07.796 --> 00:10:10.844
some of us really like to share as a form of control,

00:10:10.844 --> 00:10:13.197
and what's remarkable about digital commonses

00:10:13.197 --> 00:10:16.729
is you don't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough

00:10:16.729 --> 00:10:19.240
to generate something massive and beautiful.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.798
So not that many programmers write free software,

00:10:21.798 --> 00:10:24.133
but we have the Apache web server.

00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:26.830
Not that many people who read Wikipedia edit,

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.839
but it works. So as long as some people like to share

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:34.583
as their form of control, we can build a commons, as long as we can get the information out.

00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:36.959
And in biology, the numbers are even better.

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:39.511
So Vanderbilt ran a study asking people, we'd like to take

00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:42.833
your biosamples, your blood, and share them in a biobank,

00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:45.205
and only five percent of the people opted out.

00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:48.297
I'm from Tennessee. It's not the most science-positive state

00:10:48.297 --> 00:10:51.336
in the United States of America. (Laughter)

00:10:51.336 --> 00:10:53.714
But only five percent of the people wanted out.

00:10:53.714 --> 00:10:57.737
So people like to share, if you give them the opportunity and the choice.

00:10:57.737 --> 00:11:02.220
And the reason that I got obsessed with this, besides the obvious family aspects,

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.493
is that I spend a lot of time around mathematicians,

00:11:05.493 --> 00:11:08.407
and mathematicians are drawn to places where there's a lot of data

00:11:08.407 --> 00:11:11.350
because they can use it to tease signals out of noise.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.318
And those correlations that they can tease out, they're not

00:11:14.318 --> 00:11:18.190
necessarily causal agents, but math, in this day and age,

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.550
is like a giant set of power tools

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.425
that we're leaving on the floor, not plugged in in health,

00:11:24.425 --> 00:11:26.737
while we use hand saws.

00:11:26.737 --> 00:11:31.175
If we have a lot of shared genotypes, and a lot of shared

00:11:31.175 --> 00:11:33.923
outcomes, and a lot of shared lifestyle choices,

00:11:33.923 --> 00:11:36.699
and a lot of shared environmental information, we can start

00:11:36.699 --> 00:11:39.595
to tease out the correlations between subtle variations

00:11:39.595 --> 00:11:44.906
in people, the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices,

00:11:44.906 --> 00:11:47.392
and there's open-source infrastructure to do all of this.

00:11:47.392 --> 00:11:50.486
Sage Bionetworks is a nonprofit that's built a giant math system

00:11:50.486 --> 00:11:55.058
that's waiting for data, but there isn't any.

00:11:55.058 --> 00:11:58.946
So that's what I do. I've actually started what we think is

00:11:58.946 --> 00:12:02.884
the world's first fully digital, fully self-contributed,

00:12:02.884 --> 00:12:07.919
unlimited in scope, global in participation, ethically approved

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:11.574
clinical research study where you contribute the data.

00:12:11.574 --> 00:12:13.780
So if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust,

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.406
if you reach into your body and grab your genome,

00:12:16.406 --> 00:12:19.453
if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record,

00:12:19.453 --> 00:12:22.776
you can actually go through an online informed consent process --

00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:25.422
because the donation to the commons must be voluntary

00:12:25.422 --> 00:12:28.215
and it must be informed -- and you can actually upload

00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:30.807
your information and have it syndicated to the

00:12:30.807 --> 00:12:33.903
mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research,

00:12:33.903 --> 00:12:36.759
and the goal is to get 100,000 in the first year

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:39.117
and a million in the first five years so that we have

00:12:39.117 --> 00:12:42.951
a statistically significant cohort that you can use to take

00:12:42.951 --> 00:12:45.373
smaller sample sizes from traditional research

00:12:45.373 --> 00:12:46.972
and map it against,

00:12:46.972 --> 00:12:49.894
so that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.423
between the variations that make us unique

00:12:52.423 --> 00:12:56.447
and the kinds of health that we need to move forward as a society.

00:12:56.447 --> 00:12:59.471
And I've spent a lot of time around other commons.

00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:02.151
I've been around the early web. I've been around

00:13:02.151 --> 00:13:04.759
the early creative commons world, and there's four things

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:08.113
that all of these share, which is, they're all really simple.

00:13:08.113 --> 00:13:10.840
And so if you were to go to the website and enroll in this study,

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.095
you're not going to see something complicated.

00:13:13.095 --> 00:13:18.144
But it's not simplistic. These things are weak intentionally,

00:13:18.144 --> 00:13:21.167
right, because you can always add power and control to a system,

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:25.131
but it's very difficult to remove those things if you put them in at the beginning,

00:13:25.131 --> 00:13:27.676
and so being simple doesn't mean being simplistic,

00:13:27.676 --> 00:13:29.860
and being weak doesn't mean weakness.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.211
Those are strengths in the system.

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:34.876
And open doesn't mean that there's no money.

00:13:34.876 --> 00:13:37.896
Closed systems, corporations, make a lot of money

00:13:37.896 --> 00:13:41.435
on the open web, and they're one of the reasons why the open web lives

00:13:41.435 --> 00:13:44.262
is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness

00:13:44.262 --> 00:13:46.596
of the system.

00:13:46.596 --> 00:13:50.390
And so all of these things are part of the clinical study that we've created,

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.819
so you can actually come in, all you have to be is 14 years old,

00:13:53.819 --> 00:13:55.846
willing to sign a contract that says I'm not going to be a jerk,

00:13:55.846 --> 00:13:58.511
basically, and you're in.

00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:00.084
You can start analyzing the data.

00:14:00.084 --> 00:14:04.243
You do have to solve a CAPTCHA as well. (Laughter)

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:07.824
And if you'd like to build corporate structures on top of it,

00:14:07.824 --> 00:14:10.970
that's okay too. That's all in the consent,

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.534
so if you don't like those terms, you don't come in.

00:14:13.534 --> 00:14:16.626
It's very much the design principles of a commons

00:14:16.626 --> 00:14:19.220
that we're trying to bring to health data.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.199
And the other thing about these systems is that it only takes

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:25.378
a small number of really unreasonable people working together

00:14:25.378 --> 00:14:28.560
to create them. It didn't take that many people

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.032
to make Wikipedia Wikipedia, or to keep it Wikipedia.

00:14:32.032 --> 00:14:34.100
And we're not supposed to be unreasonable in health,

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.376
and so I hate this word "patient."

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:39.543
I don't like being patient when systems are broken,

00:14:39.543 --> 00:14:42.170
and health care is broken.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:46.334
I'm not talking about the politics of health care, I'm talking about the way we scientifically approach health care.

00:14:46.334 --> 00:14:49.604
So I don't want to be patient. And the task I'm giving to you

00:14:49.604 --> 00:14:52.650
is to not be patient. So I'd like you to actually try,

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.367
when you go home, to get your data.

00:14:55.367 --> 00:14:58.084
You'll be shocked and offended and, I would bet, outraged,

00:14:58.084 --> 00:15:00.960
at how hard it is to get it.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.579
But it's a challenge that I hope you'll take,

00:15:03.579 --> 00:15:06.040
and maybe you'll share it. Maybe you won't.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.484
If you don't have anyone in your family who's sick,

00:15:07.484 --> 00:15:10.477
maybe you wouldn't be unreasonable. But if you do,

00:15:10.477 --> 00:15:12.684
or if you've been sick, then maybe you would.

00:15:12.684 --> 00:15:15.772
And we're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months

00:15:15.772 --> 00:15:18.929
that lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there.

00:15:18.929 --> 00:15:21.051
So this is the Athena Breast Health Network. It's a study

00:15:21.051 --> 00:15:24.869
of 150,000 women in California, and they're going to

00:15:24.869 --> 00:15:27.587
return all the data to the participants of the study

00:15:27.587 --> 00:15:30.733
in a computable form, with one-clickability to load it into

00:15:30.733 --> 00:15:33.349
the study that I've put together. So we'll know exactly

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:35.653
how many people are willing to be unreasonable.

00:15:35.653 --> 00:15:38.037
So what I'd end [with] is,

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:41.357
the most beautiful thing I've learned since I quit my job

00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:44.740
almost a year ago to do this, is that it really doesn't take

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.548
very many of us to achieve spectacular results.

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:51.260
You just have to be willing to be unreasonable,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.591
and the risk we're running is not the risk those 14 men

00:15:53.591 --> 00:15:55.459
who got yellow fever ran. Right?

00:15:55.459 --> 00:15:58.320
It's to be naked, digitally, in public. So you know more

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.753
about me and my health than I know about you. It's asymmetric now.

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:05.383
And being naked and alone can be terrifying.

00:16:05.383 --> 00:16:09.850
But to be naked in a group, voluntarily, can be quite beautiful.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.738
And so it doesn't take all of us.

00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:14.744
It just takes all of some of us. Thank you.

00:16:14.744 --> 00:16:20.334
(Applause)
