00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Chris has been so nice.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
So nice, all week. He's the kind of man you could say to,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
"Chris, I'm really sorry, I've crashed your car.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And it gets worse, I crashed it into your house.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Your house has caught fire.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
And what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend."

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And you know that Chris would say, "Thank you."

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
(Laughter)

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
"Thank you for sharing, that's really interesting."

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.260
(Laughter)

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.260
"Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you."

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.260
(Laughter)

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
One of the -- (Applause) Thank you for inviting us.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
gradually, as the days go by,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.260
(Laughter)

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.260
Nuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Spectroscopy, that was another one.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Parallel universes.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And so this morning I thought, "Oh well, I'll just do a card trick."

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
(Laughter)

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
That one's gone as well.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
And today is Emmanuel's day, I think we've agreed that, already, haven't we?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Emmanuel? Absolutely. (Applause)

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
I was planning on finishing on a dance ...

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.260
(Laughter)

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
So, that's going to look pretty shabby now.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
So, what I thought I'd do is -- in honor of Emmanuel --

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.260
is, what I can do is to launch today the first

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
TED Global auction.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.260
If I could start, this is the Enigma decoding machine.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.260
(Laughter)

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Who will start me with $1,000? Anyone?

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Thank you. Bruno's face, just then,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
he said, "No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Don't go through this. Don't do it."

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.260
(Laughter)

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
I'm worried. When I first got the invitation,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
they said somewhere in the thing, they said, "15 minutes to change the world,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
your moment onstage." 15 minutes to change the world.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
I don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.260
(Laughter)

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.260
So, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Well, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
now we've seen that wonderful demonstration

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
of the wireless electric -- fantastic. You know, it inspires us.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.260
(Laughter)

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And now it's an idea.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.260
(Laughter)

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
It's great. It's fantastic.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
But you do meet some fantastic people,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
people who look at the world in a totally different way.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
Yesterday, David Deutsch, another one

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
who covered most of what I was going to say.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
(Laughter)

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
But when you think of the world in that way,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think?

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
I mean, he must walk in and they will say,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
"Would you like a macchiato,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
or a latte, or an Americano,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
or a cappuccino?"

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And he'll say,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
"You're offering me things that are infinitely variable."

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
(Laughter)

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
"How can your coffee be true?"

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
(Laughter)

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And they will say,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
"Would you mind if I serve the next customer?"

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
(Laughter)

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And Elaine Morgan yesterday, wasn't she wonderful?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Fantastic. Really good.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Her talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
the link between Darwinism

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and the fact that we are all naked beneath this --

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
And she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And I think, "I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh."

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.260
(Laughter)

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.260
This man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want?

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
(Laughter)

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And there he is.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.260
(Applause)

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
That's how TED brings these connections together.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
I wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
job application -- um, sorry.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.260
(Laughter)

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
I'm so sorry. (Applause)

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
I'm so sorry. No, no. (Applause)

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.260
No, no, ahh ... (Applause)

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.260
(As Brown): "Global problems require Scottish solutions."

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
(Laughter)

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
The problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and he looks for all the world like a man

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
who's just taken the head off a bear suit.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.260
(As Brown): "Hello, can I tell you what happened in the woods back there?

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Uh, no." (Laughter)

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.260
"I'm sorry. I've only got 18 minutes, 18 minutes to talk about saving the world,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
saving the planet, global institutions.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Our work on climate change,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
I've only got 18 minutes, unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.260
all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
in Great Britain,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ..."

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
(Laughter)

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
"The large coal-fired power station we're building

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
at King's North,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
and of course the exciting news that only today,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
only this week, Britain's only manufacturer

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
of wind turbines has been forced to close.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
No time, unfortunately,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
to mention those."

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.260
(Applause)

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
"British jobs for Scottish people ...

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.260
No." (Laughter)

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
"Christian principles, Christian values.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife."

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
(Laughter)

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
"Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem."

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
(Laughter)

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.260
(As Tony Blair): "Yeah, alright, come on, eh.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Alright Gordon, come on, eh.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
I just, can I just say a few things about,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
first about Cherie, because she's a wonderful lady,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.260
my wife, with a wonderful smile.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
That reminds me, I must post that letter."

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
(Laughter)

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
"I just think, you know, what people forget,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Gordon and I, we always got on perfectly well.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Alright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'"

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
(Laughter)

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
"You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
'Can I rely on your support for the next month?'

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.'

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Which kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before."

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.260
(Laughter)

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
to the Mansion House in 2002 --

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
that was to the building; the people weren't listening.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
But the people, when talking about the finance industry, he said,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.260
"What you as the city of London have done for financial services,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
we, as a government, hope to do for the economy as a whole."

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
(Laughter)

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
When you think what's happened to financial services,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and you see what's happened to the economy, you think,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
"Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises."

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.260
(Laughter)

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
But we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
This is the first time that I can remember, where if you get a letter

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
from the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
money from him, or if he's borrowing money from you.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
Am I right?

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
These extraordinary things, Icelandic Internet accounts.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account?

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Why would you do that? Why would -- It's like one step up

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria, isn't it?

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.260
(Laughter)

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
Asking for your bank details.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
It didn't have that kind of collateral.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
What does it have? It has fish, that's all.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
That's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
"This has left us all

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
with a very big haddock."

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.260
(Laughter)

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
A lot of what I do -- I have to try and make sense

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
of things before I can make nonsense of them.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
And making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
Luckily, somebody like George Bush was really helpful.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
He summed it up, really, at a dinner.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
He was speaking at a dinner, he said,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
"Wall Street got drunk."

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
(Laughter)

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
"And now it's got a hangover."

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
And that's, you know, that's something --

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:39.260
(Applause)

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
And that's something we can relate to.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
It's certainly something he can relate to.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
(Laughter)

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
And the other one, of course, is Donald Rumsfeld, who said,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.260
"There are the known knowns, the things we know we know.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
And then you got the known unknowns,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
the things we know we don't know.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And then you got the unknown unknowns, those are the things

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
we don't know we don't know."

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
And being English, when I first heard that I thought, "What a load of cock."

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And then, you're now, well, actually, that's what this is about.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
This whole, what Ben Bernanke has said,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.260
the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
it's about -- they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.260
In 2006, the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said, quote,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.260
"As we can clearly see,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
no seismic occurrence

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy."

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
Now, there is a man on top of his job.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.260
(Laughter)

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
at Lehman Brothers said,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
"Events which models predicted would happen

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
once every 10,000 years

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
happened every day for three days."

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
So, it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very, very difficult to make sense of.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.260
But we have a new hope. We have a new man.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
America has now elected its first openly black President.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
(Laughter)

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Wonderful news.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
Not only that, he's left-handed. Have you noticed this?

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
How many people here are left-handed?

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
You see, a lot of the people that I most admire,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
they're left-handed.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
And somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.260
you have to learn to write without smudging the ink.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
And I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it? An American President who

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
has to write without smudging the ink.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
You like that one? As opposed to you could see

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
George Bush, well, what's the metaphor there?

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it?

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
"Well, you know I'm sorry about that.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
I'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well."

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
(Laughter)

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
But, you know, he's gone. Now he's gone.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
That's eight years of American History, eight minutes of my act,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
just gone like that.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
"You know, it's the end of an error [sic].

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
I happen to believe it was a great error.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
in the history of the United States.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
But we proved them wrong in Iraq.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
There is now."

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.260
(Laughter)

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
"But I have a message for the suicide bombers,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
for those people who've blown themselves up."

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
(Laughter)

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
"We're going to find you."

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.260
(Laughter)

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
"We're going to make sure you don't do it again."

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.260
(Laughter)

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
But now he's gone, and it's great to see one of the --

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
arguably one of the worst speech makers

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
in American history,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
now given way to one of the greatest, in Obama.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
You were there, maybe, on the night of his victory.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago, he said,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:32.260
"If there is anyone out there

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
who still doubts

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:40.260
that America is a place

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
where all things are possible ..."

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long, it really would.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.260
(Laughter)

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.260
But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
And he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
And there is George Bush sitting there going, "Heh heh heh heh ..."

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.260
(Laughter)

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
"Not so easy is it? Heh heh heh."

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
(Laughter)

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
But the interesting thing is, Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
who said, people would listen to a speech, they said, "Great speech."

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
And then they'd listen to Demosthenes,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
and they'd say, "Let's march."

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
And we all want to believe in President Obama.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
It's rather like that line in the film "As Good As it Gets."

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, "What do you see in me?"

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
And Jack Nicholson just says,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
"You make me want to be a better man."

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
And you want a leader who inspires and challenges

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right?

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
But at the moment, it's a Cicero thing.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
We like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
So he comes over to this country, and he says,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
"We need

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
a big fiscal stimulus."

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
And everyone goes, "Great!" He leaves the country

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
and the French and the Germans go, "No, no, forget about that,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
absolutely not." Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.260
He says, "We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan."

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
And everyone goes, "Great idea."

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
He leaves, people go, "No no no, we're not going to do that.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it."

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
He goes to Prague, he says, "We believe in a nuclear-free world."

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And it's great to have an American president who can say the word "nuclear,"

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
let's just point that out first.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
Do you remember that? George Bush, "A nu-ca-ler."

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
Sorry, what? "A nu-ca-ler."

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.260
(Laughter)

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Could you say "avuncular"? "Avunclear."

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.260
(Laughter)

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Thank you very much.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
But he says, "We want a nuclear-free world."

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
And that day, North Korea, that very day,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
North Korea is just seeing if it can

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
just get one over Japan --

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.260
(Laughter) --

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
and land it before ...

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
So, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
"Travels the world." (Laughs)

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:45.260
"I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ..."

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.260
(Laughter)

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
"Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ..."

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.260
(Laughter)

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
"... who said, reach out and touch ..."

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
(Laughter)

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
"... somebody's gla -- hand."

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
(Laughter)

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
"Make this world a better place, if you can.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
I just think that's important. I really do.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
because she'd have been out of our home for four years.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
And I, you know." (Laughter)

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
"So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you."

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
(Laughter)

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
So, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles:

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
"And the environment is so important, all we can do.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
push emissions up her agenda."

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
(Laughter)

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:32.260
Or, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
Mandela, the great man Mandela.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
He's been honored with a statue now.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
The previous highest honor he had in Britain

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
was a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.260
"So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?"

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.260
"Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh."

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
(Laughter)

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:56.260
"I was held in prison

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
for nearly 30 years

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
on an island

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
in the middle of the ocean.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
Why would I need a bloody water feature?"

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
(Laughter)

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Very quickly: I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
from the "Japanese Essays on Idleness"

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
because it implies there is still room for growth.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
Thank you very much indeed.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:35.260
(Applause)
