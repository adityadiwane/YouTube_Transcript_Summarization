00:00:15.513 --> 00:00:17.443
I am a cultural omnivore,

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:22.103
one whose daily commute is made possible
by attachment to an iPod --

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:24.356
an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.396
pop diva Christina Aguilera,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.036
country singer Josh Turner,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.495
gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin,

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.892
concerti, symphonies and more and more.

00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:34.430
I'm a voracious reader,

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:37.385
a reader who deals with Ian McEwan
down to Stephanie Meyer.

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.614
I have read the Twilight tetralogy.

00:00:40.638 --> 00:00:43.056
And one who lives for my home theater,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.059
a home theater where I devour
DVDs, video on demand

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:47.473
and a lot of television.

00:00:47.497 --> 00:00:50.878
For me, "Law &amp; Order: SVU,"
Tina Fey and "30 Rock"

00:00:50.902 --> 00:00:52.474
and "Judge Judy" --

00:00:52.498 --> 00:00:55.895
"The people are real, the cases are real,
the rulings are final."

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:56.931
(Laughter)

00:00:56.955 --> 00:01:00.236
Now, I'm convinced a lot of you
probably share my passions,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.547
especially my passion for "Judge Judy,"

00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:06.061
and you'd fight anybody
who attempted to take her away from us,

00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:09.825
but I'm a little less convinced that you
share the central passion of my life,

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:12.562
a passion for the live
professional performing arts,

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:15.568
performing arts that represent
the orchestral repertoire, yes,

00:01:15.592 --> 00:01:18.236
but jazz as well, modern dance, opera,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.236
theater and more and more and more.

00:01:21.108 --> 00:01:24.236
Frankly, it's a sector that many of us
who work in the field

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.985
worry is being endangered
and possibly dismantled by technology.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.399
While we initially heralded the Internet
as the fantastic new marketing device

00:01:32.423 --> 00:01:34.642
that was going to solve all our problems,

00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:37.063
we now realize that the Internet
is, if anything,

00:01:37.087 --> 00:01:38.706
too effective in that regard.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.236
Depending on who you read,
an arts organization

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.726
or an artist, who tries
to attract the attention

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.971
of a potential single ticket buyer,

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:51.236
now competes with between three and 5,000
different marketing messages

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.754
a typical citizen sees every single day.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.237
We now know, in fact,

00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:59.028
that technology is our biggest
competitor for leisure time.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.303
Five years ago,

00:02:00.327 --> 00:02:05.036
Gen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV,
the majority on TV.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.895
Gen Yers spent even more --

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:09.481
23.8 hours, the majority online.

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:15.521
And now, a typical university-entering
student arrives at college

00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:19.856
already having spent 20,000 hours online

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.216
and an additional 10,000 hours
playing video games --

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:26.934
a stark reminder that we operate
in a cultural context

00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:31.731
where video games now outsell
music and movie recordings combined.

00:02:33.165 --> 00:02:35.920
Moreover, we're afraid that technology

00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:38.983
has altered our very assumptions
of cultural consumption.

00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:40.171
Thanks to the Internet,

00:02:40.195 --> 00:02:43.169
we believe we can get anything
we want whenever we want it,

00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:45.012
delivered to our own doorstep.

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:47.580
We can shop at three in the morning
or eight at night,

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:50.537
ordering jeans tailor-made
for our unique body types.

00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:54.487
Expectations of personalization
and customization

00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:56.360
that the live performing arts --

00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:59.236
which have set curtain times, set venues,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.634
attendant inconveniences
of travel, parking and the like --

00:03:02.658 --> 00:03:04.063
simply cannot meet.

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:06.526
And we're all acutely aware:

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.345
what's it going to mean in the future

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:10.545
when we ask someone
to pay a hundred dollars

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.037
for a symphony, opera or ballet ticket,

00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:16.373
when that cultural consumer
is used to downloading on the internet

00:03:16.397 --> 00:03:20.310
24 hours a day
for 99 cents a song or for free?

00:03:22.662 --> 00:03:26.701
These are enormous questions
for those of us that work in this terrain.

00:03:26.725 --> 00:03:29.836
But as particular as they feel to us,
we know we're not alone.

00:03:30.417 --> 00:03:31.791
All of us are engaged

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:36.479
in a seismic, fundamental realignment
of culture and communications,

00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:40.267
a realignment that is shaking
and decimating the newspaper industry,

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:44.321
the magazine industry,
the book and publishing industry and more.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.832
Saddled in the performing arts as we are,
by antiquated union agreements

00:03:48.856 --> 00:03:53.844
that inhibit and often prohibit
mechanical reproduction and streaming,

00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:57.712
locked into large facilities
that were designed to ossify

00:03:57.736 --> 00:04:01.083
the ideal relationship
between artist and audience

00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:03.392
most appropriate to the 19th century

00:04:03.416 --> 00:04:06.593
and locked into a business model
dependent on high ticket revenues,

00:04:06.617 --> 00:04:08.690
where we charge exorbitant prices.

00:04:09.097 --> 00:04:12.502
Many of us shudder in the wake
of the collapse of Tower Records

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:14.841
and ask ourselves, "Are we next?"

00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:21.236
Everyone I talk to in performing arts
resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.434
who, in "Dreams of a Common
Language," wrote,

00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:26.605
"We are out in a country
that has no language, no laws.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.708
Whatever we do together is pure invention.

00:04:29.732 --> 00:04:33.645
The maps they gave us
are out of date by years."

00:04:35.464 --> 00:04:37.369
And for those of you who love the arts,

00:04:37.393 --> 00:04:40.236
aren't you glad you invited
me here to brighten your day?

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.236
(Laughter)

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.702
(Applause)

00:04:43.726 --> 00:04:47.236
Now, rather than saying that we're
on the brink of our own annihilation,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.906
I prefer to believe that we are engaged
in a fundamental reformation,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.655
a reformation like the religious
Reformation of the 16th century.

00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:58.236
The arts reformation,
like the religious Reformation,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.910
is spurred in part by technology,

00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:02.671
with indeed, the printing press
really leading the charge

00:05:02.695 --> 00:05:04.522
on the religious Reformation.

00:05:04.546 --> 00:05:07.597
Both reformations were predicated
on fractious discussion,

00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:09.030
internal self-doubt

00:05:09.054 --> 00:05:12.467
and massive realignment
of antiquated business models.

00:05:13.106 --> 00:05:16.492
And at heart, both reformations, I think,
were asking the questions:

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.236
who's entitled to practice?

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.966
How are they entitled to practice?

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.978
And indeed, do we need anyone
to intermediate for us

00:05:24.002 --> 00:05:27.084
in order to have an experience
with a spiritual divine?

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:31.797
Chris Anderson,
someone I trust you all know,

00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:34.833
editor in chief of Wired magazine
and author of The Long Tail,

00:05:34.857 --> 00:05:37.961
really was the first, for me,
to nail a lot of this.

00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:39.656
He wrote a long time ago, you know,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.205
thanks to the invention of the Internet,
web technology, minicams and more,

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.684
the means of artistic production
have been democratized

00:05:48.708 --> 00:05:51.432
for the first time
in all of human history.

00:05:52.483 --> 00:05:54.936
In the 1930s, if any of you wanted
to make a movie,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.236
you had to work for
Warner Brothers or RKO,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.236
because who could afford a movie set

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.356
and lighting equipment
and editing equipment

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.163
and scoring, and more?

00:06:03.187 --> 00:06:06.366
And now who in this room
doesn't know a 14 year-old

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.921
hard at work on her second,
third, or fourth movie?

00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:10.740
(Laughter)

00:06:10.764 --> 00:06:13.848
Similarly, the means
of artistic distribution

00:06:13.872 --> 00:06:16.653
have been democratized
for the first time in human history.

00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:19.628
Again, in the '30s, Warner Brothers,
RKO did that for you.

00:06:19.652 --> 00:06:21.692
Now, go to YouTube, Facebook;

00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:23.640
you have worldwide distribution

00:06:23.664 --> 00:06:26.260
without leaving the privacy
of your own bedroom.

00:06:27.214 --> 00:06:29.590
This double impact is occasioning

00:06:29.614 --> 00:06:32.602
a massive redefinition
of the cultural market,

00:06:32.626 --> 00:06:35.374
a time when anyone is a potential author.

00:06:36.542 --> 00:06:38.889
Frankly, what we're seeing now
in this environment

00:06:38.913 --> 00:06:42.013
is a massive time,
when the entire world is changing

00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:45.175
as we move from a time
when audience numbers are plummeting.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.613
But the number of arts participants,

00:06:47.637 --> 00:06:51.450
people who write poetry, who sing songs,
who perform in church choirs,

00:06:51.474 --> 00:06:54.643
is exploding beyond
our wildest imaginations.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.073
This group, others have
called the pro-ams,

00:06:58.097 --> 00:07:00.994
amateur artists doing work
at a professional level.

00:07:01.018 --> 00:07:03.211
You see them on YouTube,
in dance competitions,

00:07:03.235 --> 00:07:04.918
film festivals and more.

00:07:04.942 --> 00:07:06.857
They are radically expanding

00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:10.060
our notions of the potential
of an aesthetic vocabulary,

00:07:10.084 --> 00:07:12.236
while they are challenging and undermining

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.236
the cultural autonomy
of our traditional institutions.

00:07:15.697 --> 00:07:19.537
Ultimately, we now live in a world
defined not by consumption,

00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:20.831
but by participation.

00:07:22.557 --> 00:07:24.324
But I want to be clear,

00:07:24.348 --> 00:07:27.128
just as the religious Reformation
did not spell the end

00:07:27.152 --> 00:07:29.165
to the formal Church or to the priesthood;

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:33.373
I believe that our artistic institutions
will continue to have importance.

00:07:33.397 --> 00:07:35.575
They currently are the best opportunities

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:37.875
for artists to have lives
of economic dignity --

00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:40.084
not opulence, of dignity.

00:07:40.108 --> 00:07:41.890
And they are the places where artists

00:07:41.914 --> 00:07:44.734
who deserve and want to work
at a certain scale of resources

00:07:44.758 --> 00:07:45.967
will find a home.

00:07:46.843 --> 00:07:50.972
But to view them as synonymous
with the entirety of the arts community

00:07:50.996 --> 00:07:52.827
is, by far, too shortsighted.

00:07:53.722 --> 00:07:57.432
And indeed, while we've tended to polarize
the amateur from the professional,

00:07:57.456 --> 00:08:01.686
the single most exciting development
in the last five to 10 years

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.513
has been the rise
of the professional hybrid artist,

00:08:05.537 --> 00:08:07.167
the professional artist who works,

00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:09.912
not primarily in the concert hall
or on the stage;

00:08:09.936 --> 00:08:13.236
but most frequently around
women's rights, or human rights,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.157
or on global warming issues
or AIDS relief for more --

00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:18.311
not out of economic necessity,

00:08:18.335 --> 00:08:20.889
but out of a deep, organic conviction

00:08:20.913 --> 00:08:23.405
that the work that she or he
is called to do

00:08:23.429 --> 00:08:27.105
cannot be accomplished in the traditional
hermetic arts environment.

00:08:27.994 --> 00:08:30.465
Today's dance world is not defined solely

00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:33.678
by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet
or the National Ballet of Canada,

00:08:33.702 --> 00:08:36.148
but by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange --

00:08:36.172 --> 00:08:39.236
a multi-generational,
professional dance company,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.868
whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82,

00:08:42.892 --> 00:08:46.478
and who work with genomic scientists
to embody the DNA strand

00:08:46.502 --> 00:08:48.687
and with nuclear physicists at CERN.

00:08:49.438 --> 00:08:51.570
Today's professional theater community

00:08:51.594 --> 00:08:54.859
is defined, not only the Shaw
and Stratford Festivals,

00:08:54.883 --> 00:08:57.427
but by the Cornerstone Theater
of Los Angeles --

00:08:57.451 --> 00:09:00.236
a collective of artists that after 9/11,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.747
brought together 10 different
religious communities --

00:09:03.771 --> 00:09:05.559
the Baha'i, the Catholic,

00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:07.236
the Muslim, the Jewish,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.988
even the Native American

00:09:09.012 --> 00:09:11.185
and the gay and lesbian
communities of faith,

00:09:11.209 --> 00:09:14.236
helping them create
their own individual plays

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.236
and one massive play,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.890
where they explored
the differences in their faith

00:09:18.914 --> 00:09:20.236
and found commonality

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.697
as an important first step
toward cross-community healing.

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:28.610
Today's performers, like Rhodessa Jones,
work in women's prisons,

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:32.146
helping women prisoners
articulate the pain of incarceration,

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.068
while today's playwrights
and directors work with youth gangs

00:09:35.092 --> 00:09:39.091
to find alternate channels to violence
and more and more and more.

00:09:40.618 --> 00:09:43.236
And indeed, I think,
rather than being annihilated,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.738
the performing arts
are poised on the brink of a time

00:09:45.762 --> 00:09:48.373
when we will be more important
than we have ever been.

00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:51.464
You know, we've said for a long time,

00:09:51.488 --> 00:09:54.828
we are critical to the health
of the economic communities in your town.

00:09:54.852 --> 00:09:56.011
And absolutely --

00:09:56.035 --> 00:09:59.998
I hope you know that every dollar spent
on a performing arts ticket in a community

00:10:00.022 --> 00:10:03.120
generates five to seven
additional dollars for the local economy,

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.162
dollars spent in restaurants
or on parking,

00:10:05.186 --> 00:10:07.734
at the fabric stores
where we buy fabric for costumes,

00:10:07.758 --> 00:10:10.236
the piano tuner who tunes
the instruments, and more.

00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:14.877
But the arts are going to be more
important to economies as we go forward,

00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:17.402
especially in industries
we can't even imagine yet,

00:10:17.426 --> 00:10:21.362
just as they have been central to the iPod
and the computer game industries,

00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:25.219
which few, if any of us,
could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:30.412
Business leadership will depend
more and more on emotional intelligence,

00:10:30.436 --> 00:10:32.401
the ability to listen deeply,

00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:33.908
to have empathy,

00:10:33.932 --> 00:10:36.644
to articulate change,
to motivate others --

00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:40.488
the very capacities that the arts
cultivate with every encounter.

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:43.759
Especially now,

00:10:43.783 --> 00:10:48.313
as we all must confront
the fallacy of a market-only orientation,

00:10:48.337 --> 00:10:50.684
uninformed by social conscience;

00:10:50.708 --> 00:10:53.513
we must seize and celebrate
the power of the arts

00:10:53.537 --> 00:10:56.097
to shape our individual
and national characters,

00:10:56.121 --> 00:10:59.188
and especially characters
of the young people,

00:10:59.212 --> 00:11:02.236
who all too often are subjected
to bombardment of sensation,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
rather than digested experience.

00:11:05.506 --> 00:11:08.498
Ultimately, especially now in this world,

00:11:08.522 --> 00:11:13.143
where we live in a context of regressive
and onerous immigration laws,

00:11:13.167 --> 00:11:16.506
in reality TV that thrives on humiliation,

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.236
and in a context of analysis,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.938
where the thing we hear most repeatedly,
day in, day out in the United States,

00:11:22.962 --> 00:11:26.067
in every train station, every bus station,
every plane station is,

00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:27.354
"Ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:27.378 --> 00:11:31.408
please report any suspicious behavior
or suspicious individuals

00:11:31.432 --> 00:11:33.394
to the authorities nearest to you,"

00:11:33.418 --> 00:11:35.356
when all of these ways we are encouraged

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.428
to view our fellow human being
with hostility and fear

00:11:38.452 --> 00:11:40.180
and contempt and suspicion.

00:11:41.176 --> 00:11:44.019
The arts, whatever they do,
whenever they call us together,

00:11:44.043 --> 00:11:48.685
invite us to look at our fellow
human being with generosity and curiosity.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:54.681
God knows, if we ever needed
that capacity in human history,

00:11:54.705 --> 00:11:56.723
we need it now.

00:12:00.374 --> 00:12:02.236
You know, we're bound together,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.687
not, I think by technology,
entertainment and design,

00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:06.950
but by common cause.

00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:11.064
We work to promote
healthy vibrant societies,

00:12:11.088 --> 00:12:13.529
to ameliorate human suffering,

00:12:13.553 --> 00:12:18.157
to promote a more thoughtful,
substantive, empathic world order.

00:12:20.131 --> 00:12:22.711
I salute all of you
as activists in that quest

00:12:22.735 --> 00:12:25.903
and urge you to embrace
and hold dear the arts in your work,

00:12:25.927 --> 00:12:27.677
whatever your purpose may be.

00:12:28.606 --> 00:12:31.525
I promise you the hand
of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation

00:12:31.549 --> 00:12:34.248
is stretched out in friendship
for now and years to come.

00:12:34.272 --> 00:12:36.658
And I thank you for your kindness
and your patience

00:12:36.682 --> 00:12:38.340
in listening to me this afternoon.

00:12:38.364 --> 00:12:39.604
Thank you, and Godspeed.
