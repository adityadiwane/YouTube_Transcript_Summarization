00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I had a fire nine days ago.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
My archive:

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
175 films, my 16-millimeter negative,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
all my books, my dad's books, my photographs.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
I'd collected --

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
I was a collector, major, big-time.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
It's gone.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
I just looked at it,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
and I didn't know what to do.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
I mean, this was --

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
was I my things?

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
I always live in the present -- I love the present.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
I cherish the future.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
And I was taught some strange thing as a kid,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
like, you've got to make something good out of something bad.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
You've got to make something good out of something bad.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
This was bad! Man, I was --

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
I cough. I was sick.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
That's my camera lens. The first one --

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
That's my feature film. "King, Murray"

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
won Cannes Film Festival 1970 --

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
the only print I had.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
That's my papers.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
That was in minutes -- 20 minutes.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
"You've got to make something good out of something bad,"

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
I started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
By the way, that's "Sputnik." I ran it last year.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
"Sputnik" was downtown, the negative. It wasn't touched.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
which opens in New York in two weeks

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
downtown.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said, "Come dig."

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
That's me at my desk.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
That was a desk took 40-some years to build.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
You know -- all the stuff.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
That's my daughter, Jean.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
She came. She's a nurse in San Francisco.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
"Dig it up," I said. "Pieces.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
I want pieces. Bits and pieces."

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
I came up with this idea: a life of bits and pieces,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
which I'm just starting to work on -- my next project.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
That's my sister. She took care of pictures,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
because I was a big collector of snapshot photography

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
that I believed said a lot.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
And those are some of the pictures that --

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
something was good about the burnt pictures.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
I didn't know. I looked at that --

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
I said, "Wow, is that better than the --"

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
That's my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
It's the only copy I had. Pieces of it.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
Idea about women.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
So I started to say, "Hey, man, you are too much!

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
You could cry about this." I really didn't.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
I just instead said,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
"I'm going to make something out of it, and maybe next year ... "

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
And I appreciate this moment

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
to come up on this stage with so many people

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
who've already given me so much solace,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
and just say to TEDsters:

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
I'm proud of me. That I take something bad,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
I turn it, and I'm going to make something good out of this,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
all these pieces.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
That's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
I was a big record collector --

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
the records didn't make it. Boy, I tell you,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
film burns. Film burns.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
I mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
The negatives are gone.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.330
That's my father's letter to me, telling me to

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
marry the woman I first married when I was 20.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
That's my daughter and me.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
She's still there. She's there this morning, actually.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
That's my house.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
My family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
That's my wife, Heidi,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
who didn't take it as well as I did.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
My children, Davey and Henry.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
My son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
So, my message to you folks,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
from my three minutes, is that I appreciate the chance

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
to share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
I came to live it, and I am living it.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.330
That's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz, in Bonny Doon,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.330
just 35 miles from here.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
Thank you everybody.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
(Applause)
