00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'd like to begin this song I wrote

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder:

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
"I find no peace, and all my war is done;

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I fly above the wind,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and yet I cannot arise;

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And naught I have,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and all the world I seize upon."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
♫ Have but I don't have ♫

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
♫ It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back ♫

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
♫ Gone with the last train, honey don't you fret ♫

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
♫ Every cloud has a silver lining ♫

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
♫ Just a little rain, just a little rain, just a little rain ♫

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
♫ Have but I don't have ♫

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says, ♫

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
♫ "Good things come to those who wait" ♫

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
♫ And I can't stand in ... ♫

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
♫ I can't stand in line forever ♫

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
♫ Stand the cold air ♫

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
♫ Glad-handed ♫

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
♫ Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe" ♫

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
♫ Take it, fake it, take it, take-it-or-leave-it life ♫

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
♫ And I gotta just tame it ♫

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
♫ I gotta just name it ♫

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
♫ I gotta just seize, so please, oh please, oh please, oh please ♫

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
♫ Oh please me right, 'cause ♫

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
♫ My mind won't stop ♫

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
♫ And my heart says go ♫

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
♫ My mind won't stop -- and my heart says go-ooooo ... ♫

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
♫ Good things must be here -- yes, right here ♫

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
♫ Here, right here, right here ♫

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
♫ I won't live this life forever ♫

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
♫ One time round is all the offer is ♫

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
♫ Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe" ♫

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
♫ Take it, fake it, make it, leave it life ♫

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
♫ And I gotta just name it, I gotta just claim it ♫

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
♫ I gotta just seize ♫

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
♫ Oh please, oh please, oh please me right ♫

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
♫ Have but I don't have -- you know that ♫

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me, no ♫

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
♫ 'Cause I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
♫ Have but I -- have what I want ♫

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
♫ Have but I don't have, what I want ♫

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
♫ Have but I don't have, what I want ♫

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
♫ Have but I don't have what I want ♫

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
(Applause)
