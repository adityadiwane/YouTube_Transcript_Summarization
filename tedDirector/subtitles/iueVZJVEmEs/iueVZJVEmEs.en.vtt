00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:17.887
What you have here

00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:21.180
is an electronic cigarette.

00:00:22.097 --> 00:00:25.316
It's something that, since it was
invented a year or two ago,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.811
has given me untold happiness.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:28.016
(Laughter)

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.475
A little bit of it,
I think, is the nicotine,

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.709
but there's something
much bigger than that;

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:38.300
which is, ever since, in the UK,
they banned smoking in public places,

00:00:38.324 --> 00:00:41.144
I've never enjoyed
a drinks party ever again.

00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:43.026
(Laughter)

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.146
And the reason, I only worked out
just the other day,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.838
which is: when you go
to a drinks party and you stand up

00:00:48.862 --> 00:00:51.822
and hold a glass of red wine
and you talk endlessly to people,

00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:54.420
you don't actually want to spend
all the time talking.

00:00:54.444 --> 00:00:55.915
It's really, really tiring.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:59.952
Sometimes you just want to stand there
silently, alone with your thoughts.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:03.978
Sometimes you just want to stand
in the corner and stare out of the window.

00:01:04.907 --> 00:01:08.081
Now the problem is, when you can't smoke,

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:11.756
if you stand and stare
out of the window on your own,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.002
you're an antisocial, friendless idiot.

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:16.336
(Laughter)

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.765
If you stand and stare out of the window
on your own with a cigarette,

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.542
you're a fucking philosopher.

00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.369
(Laughter)

00:01:24.393 --> 00:01:30.045
(Applause)

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.514
So the power of reframing things

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:37.434
cannot be overstated.

00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:40.830
What we have is exactly
the same thing, the same activity,

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:43.172
but one of them makes you feel great

00:01:43.196 --> 00:01:46.897
and the other one,
with just a small change of posture,

00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:48.142
makes you feel terrible.

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:52.434
And I think one of the problems
with classical economics is,

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:54.891
it's absolutely preoccupied with reality.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:58.549
And reality isn't a particularly good
guide to human happiness.

00:01:59.155 --> 00:02:04.163
Why, for example,
are pensioners much happier

00:02:04.187 --> 00:02:05.568
than the young unemployed?

00:02:06.553 --> 00:02:09.799
Both of them, after all,
are in exactly the same stage of life.

00:02:09.823 --> 00:02:12.775
You both have too much time
on your hands and not much money.

00:02:13.616 --> 00:02:16.317
But pensioners are reportedly
very, very happy,

00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:19.768
whereas the unemployed
are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed.

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.091
The reason, I think,
is that the pensioners believe

00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:24.688
they've chosen to be pensioners,

00:02:24.712 --> 00:02:28.665
whereas the young unemployed
feel it's been thrust upon them.

00:02:29.998 --> 00:02:34.034
In England, the upper-middle classes have
actually solved this problem perfectly,

00:02:34.058 --> 00:02:36.384
because they've re-branded unemployment.

00:02:36.408 --> 00:02:38.674
If you're an upper-middle-class
English person,

00:02:38.698 --> 00:02:41.026
you call unemployment "a year off."

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.744
(Laughter)

00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:46.812
And that's because having a son
who's unemployed in Manchester

00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:48.763
is really quite embarrassing.

00:02:48.787 --> 00:02:51.865
But having a son
who's unemployed in Thailand

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.972
is really viewed
as quite an accomplishment.

00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:56.025
(Laughter)

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.372
But actually, the power
to re-brand things --

00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:03.935
to understand that
our experiences, costs, things

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.409
don't actually much depend
on what they really are,

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:08.006
but on how we view them --

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.939
I genuinely think can't be overstated.

00:03:10.963 --> 00:03:13.419
There's an experiment
I think Daniel Pink refers to,

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.962
where you put two dogs in a box

00:03:15.986 --> 00:03:19.199
and the box has an electric floor.

00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:25.045
Every now and then,
an electric shock is applied to the floor,

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.896
which pains the dogs.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.758
The only difference is one of the dogs
has a small button in its half of the box.

00:03:31.782 --> 00:03:35.576
And when it nuzzles the button,
the electric shock stops.

00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:39.140
The other dog doesn't have the button.

00:03:39.164 --> 00:03:43.405
It's exposed to exactly the same level
of pain as the dog in the first box,

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.303
but it has no control
over the circumstances.

00:03:47.438 --> 00:03:50.333
Generally, the first dog
can be relatively content.

00:03:50.357 --> 00:03:53.301
The second dog lapses
into complete depression.

00:03:54.642 --> 00:03:58.930
The circumstances of our lives
may actually matter less to our happiness

00:03:58.954 --> 00:04:02.691
than the sense of control
we feel over our lives.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.334
It's an interesting question.

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:09.607
We ask the question -- the whole
debate in the Western world

00:04:09.631 --> 00:04:11.465
is about the level of taxation.

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.712
But I think there's another
debate to be asked,

00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:17.167
which is the level of control
we have over our tax money,

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:21.827
that what costs us 10 pounds
in one context can be a curse;

00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:26.453
what costs us 10 pounds in a different
context, we may actually welcome.

00:04:27.564 --> 00:04:31.878
You know, pay 20,000 pounds
in tax toward health,

00:04:31.902 --> 00:04:33.831
and you're merely feeling a mug.

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:37.117
Pay 20,000 pounds
to endow a hospital ward,

00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:39.007
and you're called a philanthropist.

00:04:40.177 --> 00:04:43.578
I'm probably in the wrong country
to talk about willingness to pay tax.

00:04:43.602 --> 00:04:45.289
(Laughter)

00:04:45.313 --> 00:04:50.513
So I'll give you one in return:
how you frame things really matters.

00:04:50.537 --> 00:04:52.815
Do you call it "The bailout of Greece"?

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:56.035
Or "The bailout of a load of stupid banks
which lent to Greece"?

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:57.070
(Laughter)

00:04:57.094 --> 00:04:59.444
Because they are actually the same thing.

00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:03.328
What you call them
actually affects how you react to them,

00:05:03.352 --> 00:05:05.386
viscerally and morally.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.604
I think psychological value is great,
to be absolutely honest.

00:05:08.628 --> 00:05:11.500
One of my great friends,
a professor called Nick Chater,

00:05:11.524 --> 00:05:14.398
who's the Professor of Decision
Sciences in London,

00:05:14.422 --> 00:05:18.922
believes we should spend far less time
looking into humanity's hidden depths,

00:05:18.946 --> 00:05:22.369
and spend much more time
exploring the hidden shallows.

00:05:22.393 --> 00:05:23.905
I think that's true, actually.

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:29.003
I think impressions have an insane effect
on what we think and what we do.

00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:32.610
But what we don't have is a really
good model of human psychology --

00:05:32.634 --> 00:05:34.919
at least pre-Kahneman, perhaps,

00:05:34.943 --> 00:05:37.907
we didn't have a really good model
of human psychology

00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:42.804
to put alongside models of engineering,
of neoclassical economics.

00:05:42.828 --> 00:05:46.151
So people who believed in psychological
solutions didn't have a model.

00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:48.110
We didn't have a framework.

00:05:48.134 --> 00:05:51.481
This is what Warren Buffett's
business partner Charlie Munger calls

00:05:51.505 --> 00:05:53.866
"a latticework on which
to hang your ideas."

00:05:54.707 --> 00:05:57.580
Engineers, economists,
classical economists

00:05:57.604 --> 00:06:00.535
all had a very, very robust
existing latticework

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:03.254
on which practically
every idea could be hung.

00:06:03.278 --> 00:06:06.674
We merely have a collection
of random individual insights

00:06:06.698 --> 00:06:08.099
without an overall model.

00:06:08.872 --> 00:06:13.311
And what that means
is that, in looking at solutions,

00:06:13.335 --> 00:06:16.061
we've probably given too much priority

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:20.206
to what I call technical engineering
solutions, Newtonian solutions,

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.608
and not nearly enough
to the psychological ones.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:24.945
You know my example of the Eurostar:

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:26.167
six million pounds spent

00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:29.411
to reduce the journey time
between Paris and London

00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:30.873
by about 40 minutes.

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:35.677
For 0.01 percent of this money,
you could have put wi-fi on the trains,

00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:38.369
which wouldn't have reduced
the duration of the journey,

00:06:38.393 --> 00:06:42.312
but would have improved its enjoyment
and its usefulness far more.

00:06:43.285 --> 00:06:44.953
For maybe 10 percent of the money,

00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:48.311
you could have paid all of the world's top
male and female supermodels

00:06:48.335 --> 00:06:51.270
to walk up and down the train
handing out free Château Pétrus

00:06:51.294 --> 00:06:52.568
to all the passengers.

00:06:52.592 --> 00:06:53.634
(Laughter)

00:06:53.658 --> 00:06:56.008
You'd still have five million
pounds in change,

00:06:56.032 --> 00:06:58.657
and people would ask
for the trains to be slowed down.

00:06:58.681 --> 00:07:02.775
(Laughter)

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:06.161
Why were we not given the chance
to solve that problem psychologically?

00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:08.669
I think it's because there's an imbalance,

00:07:08.693 --> 00:07:15.327
an asymmetry in the way we treat creative,
emotionally driven psychological ideas

00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:20.252
versus the way we treat rational,
numerical, spreadsheet-driven ideas.

00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:22.743
If you're a creative person,
I think, quite rightly,

00:07:22.767 --> 00:07:24.902
you have to share
all your ideas for approval

00:07:24.926 --> 00:07:26.863
with people much more rational than you.

00:07:26.887 --> 00:07:30.151
You have to go in
and have a cost-benefit analysis,

00:07:30.175 --> 00:07:33.228
a feasibility study,
an ROI study and so forth.

00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:34.994
And I think that's probably right.

00:07:35.903 --> 00:07:38.549
But this does not apply
the other way around.

00:07:38.573 --> 00:07:40.601
People who have an existing framework --

00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:43.004
an economic framework,
an engineering framework --

00:07:43.028 --> 00:07:46.194
feel that, actually,
logic is its own answer.

00:07:46.763 --> 00:07:49.669
What they don't say is,
"Well, the numbers all seem to add up,

00:07:49.693 --> 00:07:53.145
but before I present this idea,
I'll show it to some really crazy people

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:55.535
to see if they can come up with
something better."

00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:58.314
And so we -- artificially,
I think -- prioritize

00:07:58.338 --> 00:08:02.089
what I'd call mechanistic ideas
over psychological ideas.

00:08:02.837 --> 00:08:04.869
An example of a great psychological idea:

00:08:04.893 --> 00:08:07.509
the single best improvement
in passenger satisfaction

00:08:07.533 --> 00:08:08.837
on the London Underground,

00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:10.431
per pound spent,

00:08:10.455 --> 00:08:12.790
came when they didn't add
any extra trains,

00:08:12.814 --> 00:08:14.719
nor change the frequency of the trains;

00:08:14.743 --> 00:08:17.872
they put dot matrix display boards
on the platforms --

00:08:18.877 --> 00:08:22.728
because the nature of a wait is not just
dependent on its numerical quality,

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:23.995
its duration,

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:27.433
but on the level of uncertainty
you experience during that wait.

00:08:27.457 --> 00:08:30.346
Waiting seven minutes for a train
with a countdown clock

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.263
is less frustrating and irritating

00:08:32.287 --> 00:08:35.226
than waiting four minutes,
knuckle biting, going,

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.538
"When's this train
going to damn well arrive?"

00:08:38.139 --> 00:08:40.696
Here's a beautiful example
of a psychological solution

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.891
deployed in Korea.

00:08:41.915 --> 00:08:44.324
Red traffic lights have a countdown delay.

00:08:44.348 --> 00:08:47.374
It's proven to reduce
the accident rate in experiments.

00:08:47.398 --> 00:08:48.556
Why?

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.101
Because road rage, impatience and general
irritation are massively reduced

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:55.974
when you can actually see
the time you have to wait.

00:08:55.998 --> 00:08:58.901
In China, not really understanding
the principle behind this,

00:08:58.925 --> 00:09:01.664
they applied the same principle
to green traffic lights --

00:09:01.688 --> 00:09:05.526
(Laughter)

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.072
which isn't a great idea.

00:09:07.096 --> 00:09:10.186
You're 200 yards away, you realize
you've got five seconds to go,

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.362
you floor it.

00:09:11.386 --> 00:09:14.709
(Laughter)

00:09:14.733 --> 00:09:17.234
The Koreans, very assiduously,
did test both.

00:09:17.258 --> 00:09:20.593
The accident rate goes down
when you apply this to red traffic lights;

00:09:20.617 --> 00:09:23.205
it goes up when you apply it
to green traffic lights.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:26.167
This is all I'm asking for, really,
in human decision making,

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.296
is the consideration
of these three things.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.285
I'm not asking for the complete primacy
of one over the other.

00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:33.549
I'm merely saying
that when you solve problems,

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.055
you should look
at all three of these equally,

00:09:36.079 --> 00:09:38.280
and you should seek as far as possible

00:09:38.304 --> 00:09:41.163
to find solutions which sit
in the sweet spot in the middle.

00:09:41.187 --> 00:09:43.158
If you actually look at a great business,

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:46.771
you'll nearly always see all of these
three things coming into play.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.478
Really successful businesses --

00:09:48.502 --> 00:09:51.164
Google is a great, great
technological success,

00:09:51.188 --> 00:09:54.387
but it's also based
on a very good psychological insight:

00:09:55.354 --> 00:09:57.911
people believe something
that only does one thing

00:09:57.935 --> 00:10:02.094
is better at that thing than something
that does that thing and something else.

00:10:02.118 --> 00:10:04.824
It's an innate thing
called "goal dilution."

00:10:04.848 --> 00:10:07.609
Ayelet Fishbach has written
a paper about this.

00:10:07.633 --> 00:10:10.123
Everybody else at the time
of Google, more or less,

00:10:10.147 --> 00:10:11.394
was trying to be a portal.

00:10:11.418 --> 00:10:14.244
Yes, there's a search function,
but you also have weather,

00:10:14.268 --> 00:10:15.926
sports scores, bits of news.

00:10:17.189 --> 00:10:19.731
Google understood
that if you're just a search engine,

00:10:19.755 --> 00:10:22.593
people assume you're a very,
very good search engine.

00:10:22.617 --> 00:10:26.099
All of you know this, actually,
from when you go in to buy a television,

00:10:26.123 --> 00:10:29.025
and in the shabbier end
of the row of flat-screen TVs,

00:10:29.049 --> 00:10:31.354
you can see, are these
rather despised things

00:10:31.378 --> 00:10:34.352
called "combined TV and DVD players."

00:10:35.062 --> 00:10:38.253
And we have no knowledge whatsoever
of the quality of those things,

00:10:38.277 --> 00:10:41.716
but we look at a combined
TV and DVD player and we go, "Uck.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.672
It's probably a bit of a crap telly
and a bit rubbish as a DVD player."

00:10:45.696 --> 00:10:48.113
So we walk out of the shops
with one of each.

00:10:48.586 --> 00:10:53.186
Google is as much a psychological success
as it is a technological one.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.893
I propose that we can use
psychology to solve problems

00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:59.248
that we didn't even realize
were problems at all.

00:10:59.272 --> 00:11:03.035
This is my suggestion for getting people
to finish their course of antibiotics.

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:04.628
Don't give them 24 white pills;

00:11:04.652 --> 00:11:07.665
give them 18 white pills and six blue ones

00:11:07.689 --> 00:11:09.756
and tell them to take
the white pills first,

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.250
and then take the blue ones.

00:11:12.146 --> 00:11:13.297
It's called "chunking."

00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:16.297
The likelihood that people will get
to the end is much greater

00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:18.901
when there is a milestone
somewhere in the middle.

00:11:20.107 --> 00:11:22.453
One of the great mistakes,
I think, of economics

00:11:22.477 --> 00:11:24.880
is it fails to understand
that what something is --

00:11:24.904 --> 00:11:27.412
whether it's retirement,
unemployment, cost --

00:11:28.676 --> 00:11:32.400
is a function, not only of its amount,
but also its meaning.

00:11:33.231 --> 00:11:36.033
This is a toll crossing in Britain.

00:11:36.057 --> 00:11:38.994
Quite often queues happen at the tolls.

00:11:39.018 --> 00:11:41.242
Sometimes you get very,
very severe queues.

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:43.456
You could apply
the same principle, actually,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.220
to the security lanes in airports.

00:11:45.244 --> 00:11:48.230
What would happen if you could actually
pay twice as much money

00:11:48.254 --> 00:11:49.405
to cross the bridge,

00:11:49.429 --> 00:11:51.548
but go through a lane
that's an express lane?

00:11:51.572 --> 00:11:53.342
It's not an unreasonable thing to do;

00:11:53.366 --> 00:11:55.377
it's an economically
efficient thing to do.

00:11:55.401 --> 00:11:57.442
Time means more
to some people than others.

00:11:57.466 --> 00:11:59.897
If you're waiting trying
to get to a job interview,

00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:04.135
you'd patently pay a couple of pounds more
to go through the fast lane.

00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:06.488
If you're on the way
to visit your mother-in-law,

00:12:06.512 --> 00:12:07.663
you'd probably prefer --

00:12:07.687 --> 00:12:08.870
(Laughter)

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:11.028
you'd probably prefer to stay on the left.

00:12:11.616 --> 00:12:15.093
The only problem is if you introduce
this economically efficient solution,

00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:16.267
people hate it ...

00:12:16.894 --> 00:12:20.225
because they think you're deliberately
creating delays at the bridge

00:12:20.249 --> 00:12:21.903
in order to maximize your revenue,

00:12:21.927 --> 00:12:25.315
and, "Why on earth should I pay
to subsidize your incompetence?"

00:12:25.636 --> 00:12:27.816
On the other hand,
change the frame slightly

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.131
and create charitable yield management,

00:12:30.155 --> 00:12:33.289
so the extra money you get
goes not to the bridge company,

00:12:33.313 --> 00:12:34.504
it goes to charity ...

00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:38.316
and the mental willingness
to pay completely changes.

00:12:39.388 --> 00:12:42.031
You have a relatively
economically efficient solution,

00:12:42.055 --> 00:12:44.374
but one that actually meets
with public approval

00:12:44.398 --> 00:12:46.398
and even a small degree of affection,

00:12:46.422 --> 00:12:48.611
rather than being seen as bastardy.

00:12:49.764 --> 00:12:52.418
So where economists
make the fundamental mistake

00:12:52.442 --> 00:12:54.407
is they think that money is money.

00:12:55.535 --> 00:12:59.766
Actually, my pain experienced
in paying five pounds

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.937
is not just proportionate to the amount,

00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:03.945
but where I think that money is going.

00:13:04.574 --> 00:13:07.570
And I think understanding that
could revolutionize tax policy.

00:13:07.594 --> 00:13:09.597
It could revolutionize
the public services.

00:13:09.621 --> 00:13:12.134
It could actually change things
quite significantly.

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:13.620
[Ludwig Von Mises is my hero.]

00:13:13.644 --> 00:13:15.358
Here's a guy you all need to study.

00:13:15.382 --> 00:13:16.987
He's an Austrian School economist

00:13:17.011 --> 00:13:21.575
who was first active in the first half
of the 20th century in Vienna.

00:13:21.599 --> 00:13:23.791
What was interesting
about the Austrian School

00:13:23.815 --> 00:13:26.848
is they actually grew up alongside Freud.

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:29.525
And so they're predominantly
interested in psychology.

00:13:29.549 --> 00:13:34.102
They believed that there was
a discipline called praxeology,

00:13:34.126 --> 00:13:36.722
which is a prior discipline
to the study of economics.

00:13:36.746 --> 00:13:41.194
Praxeology is the study of human choice,
action and decision-making.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.245
I think they're right.

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:45.337
I think the danger
we have in today's world

00:13:45.361 --> 00:13:47.041
is we have the study of economics

00:13:47.065 --> 00:13:51.095
considers itself to be a prior discipline
to the study of human psychology.

00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:54.088
But as Charlie Munger says,
"If economics isn't behavioral,

00:13:54.112 --> 00:13:55.659
I don't know what the hell is."

00:13:57.064 --> 00:14:02.865
Von Mises, interestingly, believes
economics is just a subset of psychology.

00:14:02.889 --> 00:14:04.794
I think he just refers to economics

00:14:04.818 --> 00:14:08.098
as "the study of human praxeology
under conditions of scarcity."

00:14:09.002 --> 00:14:12.098
But Von Mises, among many other things,

00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:16.772
I think uses an analogy which is probably
the best justification and explanation

00:14:16.796 --> 00:14:21.003
for the value of marketing,
the value of perceived value

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:24.304
and the fact that we should treat it
as being absolutely equivalent

00:14:24.328 --> 00:14:25.811
to any other kind of value.

00:14:26.314 --> 00:14:29.266
We tend to, all of us, even those of us
who work in marketing,

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:30.588
think of value in two ways:

00:14:30.612 --> 00:14:33.509
the real value, which is when
you make something in a factory

00:14:33.533 --> 00:14:34.687
or provide a service,

00:14:34.711 --> 00:14:36.329
and then there's a dubious value,

00:14:36.353 --> 00:14:39.164
which you create by changing
the way people look at things.

00:14:39.188 --> 00:14:41.482
Von Mises completely rejected
this distinction.

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:43.397
And he used this following analogy:

00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:48.754
he referred to strange economists
called the French physiocrats,

00:14:48.778 --> 00:14:52.408
who believed that the only true value
was what you extracted from the land.

00:14:52.432 --> 00:14:54.917
So if you're a shepherd
or a quarryman or a farmer,

00:14:54.941 --> 00:14:56.362
you created true value.

00:14:56.386 --> 00:14:59.245
If however, you bought
some wool from the shepherd

00:14:59.269 --> 00:15:02.250
and charged a premium
for converting it into a hat,

00:15:02.274 --> 00:15:04.056
you weren't actually creating value,

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.840
you were exploiting the shepherd.

00:15:06.699 --> 00:15:10.422
Now, Von Mises said that modern
economists make exactly the same mistake

00:15:10.446 --> 00:15:12.503
with regard to advertising and marketing.

00:15:12.837 --> 00:15:14.719
He says if you run a restaurant,

00:15:14.743 --> 00:15:16.982
there is no healthy distinction to be made

00:15:17.006 --> 00:15:19.559
between the value you create
by cooking the food

00:15:19.583 --> 00:15:21.886
and the value you create
by sweeping the floor.

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:24.953
One of them creates, perhaps,
the primary product --

00:15:24.977 --> 00:15:26.842
the thing we think we're paying for --

00:15:26.866 --> 00:15:29.707
the other one creates a context
within which we can enjoy

00:15:29.731 --> 00:15:31.255
and appreciate that product.

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:34.451
And the idea that one of them
should have priority over the other

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:35.625
is fundamentally wrong.

00:15:36.204 --> 00:15:37.871
Try this quick thought experiment:

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:40.546
imagine a restaurant
that serves Michelin-starred food,

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.217
but where the restaurant smells of sewage

00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:45.379
and there's human feces on the floor.

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:46.812
(Laughter)

00:15:46.836 --> 00:15:49.329
The best thing you can do there
to create value

00:15:49.353 --> 00:15:52.369
is not actually to improve
the food still further,

00:15:52.393 --> 00:15:55.192
it's to get rid of the smell
and clean up the floor.

00:15:57.519 --> 00:16:00.072
And it's vital we understand this.

00:16:00.096 --> 00:16:02.743
If that seems like a sort
of strange, abstruse thing --

00:16:02.767 --> 00:16:06.665
in the UK, the post office
had a 98 percent success rate

00:16:06.689 --> 00:16:08.873
at delivering first-class
mail the next day.

00:16:09.452 --> 00:16:11.337
They decided this wasn't good enough,

00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:13.153
and they wanted to get it up to 99.

00:16:14.494 --> 00:16:17.867
The effort to do that
almost broke the organization.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.170
If, at the same time,
you'd gone and asked people,

00:16:21.194 --> 00:16:24.013
"What percentage of first-class mail
arrives the next day?"

00:16:24.037 --> 00:16:27.943
the average answer, or the modal answer,
would have been "50 to 60 percent."

00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:31.355
Now, if your perception
is much worse than your reality,

00:16:31.379 --> 00:16:34.403
what on earth are you doing
trying to change the reality?

00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:38.042
That's like trying to improve the food
in a restaurant that stinks.

00:16:39.622 --> 00:16:42.340
What you need to do is,
first of all, tell people

00:16:42.364 --> 00:16:46.871
that 98 percent of first-class mail
gets there the next day.

00:16:46.895 --> 00:16:48.416
That's pretty good.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.648
I would argue, in Britain,
there's a much better frame of reference,

00:16:51.672 --> 00:16:55.039
which is to tell people that more
first-class mail arrives the next day

00:16:55.063 --> 00:16:57.778
in the UK than in Germany,
because generally, in Britain,

00:16:57.802 --> 00:17:00.086
if you want to make us happy
about something,

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.302
just tell us we do it
better than the Germans.

00:17:02.326 --> 00:17:04.056
(Laughter)

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.332
(Applause)

00:17:06.356 --> 00:17:09.577
Choose your frame of reference
and the perceived value,

00:17:09.601 --> 00:17:13.007
and therefore, the actual value
is completely transformed.

00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:14.676
It has to be said of the Germans

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.402
that the Germans and the French
are doing a brilliant job

00:17:17.426 --> 00:17:18.880
of creating a united Europe.

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:21.774
The only thing they didn't expect
is they're uniting Europe

00:17:21.798 --> 00:17:24.796
through a shared mild hatred
of the French and Germans.

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:26.870
But I'm British;
that's the way we like it.

00:17:26.894 --> 00:17:29.019
(Laughter)

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:31.480
What you'll also notice
is that, in any case,

00:17:31.504 --> 00:17:32.694
our perception is leaky.

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.596
We can't tell the difference
between the quality of the food

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.633
and the environment
in which we consume it.

00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:39.695
All of you will have seen this phenomenon

00:17:39.719 --> 00:17:41.701
if you have your car washed or valeted.

00:17:41.725 --> 00:17:44.846
When you drive away,
your car feels as if it drives better.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.211
(Laughter)

00:17:46.235 --> 00:17:47.491
And the reason for this --

00:17:47.515 --> 00:17:50.163
unless my car valet
mysteriously is changing the oil

00:17:50.187 --> 00:17:53.530
and performing work which I'm not paying
him for and I'm unaware of --

00:17:53.554 --> 00:17:55.861
is because perception
is, in any case, leaky.

00:17:55.885 --> 00:17:59.802
Analgesics that are branded
are more effective at reducing pain

00:17:59.826 --> 00:18:01.637
than analgesics that are not branded.

00:18:01.661 --> 00:18:04.279
I don't just mean through reported
pain reduction --

00:18:04.303 --> 00:18:05.974
actual measured pain reduction.

00:18:05.998 --> 00:18:10.622
And so perception
actually is leaky in any case.

00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:14.299
So if you do something
that's perceptually bad in one respect,

00:18:14.323 --> 00:18:15.546
you can damage the other.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.721
Thank you very much.

00:18:16.745 --> 00:18:19.133
(Applause)
