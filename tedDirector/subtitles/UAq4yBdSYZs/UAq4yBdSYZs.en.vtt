00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
When I was five years old

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
I fell in love with airplanes.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
Now I'm talking about the '30s.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
In the '30s an airplane had two wings

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
and a round motor,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
and was always flown

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.160
by a guy who looked like Cary Grant.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
He had high leather boots,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
jodhpurs, an old leather jacket,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
a wonderful helmet

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
and those marvelous goggles --

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
and, inevitably, a white scarf,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
to flow in the wind.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
He'd always walk up to his airplane

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
in a kind of saunter,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
devil-may-care saunter,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
flick the cigarette away,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
grab the girl waiting here, give her a kiss.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.160
(Laughter)

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
And then mount his airplane,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
maybe for the last time.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
Of course I always wondered what would happen

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
if he'd kissed the airplane first.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:27.160
(Laughter)

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
But this was real romance to me.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
Everything about flying in those years,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
which was -- you have to stop and think for a moment --

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
was probably the most advanced

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
technological thing going on at the time.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
So as a youngster,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
I tried to get close to this

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
by drawing airplanes,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
constantly drawing airplanes.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
It's the way I got

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
a part of this romance.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
And of course, in a way, when I say romance,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
I mean in part

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
the aesthetics of that whole situation.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.160
I think the word is the holistic experience

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
revolving around a product.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
The product was that airplane.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
But it built a romance.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
Even the parts of the airplane

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
had French names.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.160
Ze fuselage, ze empanage, ze nessal.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.160
You know, from a romance language.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
So that it was something that just got into your spirit.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
It did mine.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
And I decided I had to get closer than

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
just drawing fantasy airplanes.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
I wanted to build airplanes.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
So I built model airplanes.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.160
And I found that in doing the model airplanes

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
the appearance drawings were not enough.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
You couldn't transfer those

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
to the model itself.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
If you wanted it to fly

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
you had to learn the discipline

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
of flying.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
You had to learn about aeronautics.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
You had to learn what made an airplane

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
stay in the air.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
And of course, as a model in those years, you couldn't control it.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
So it had to be self-righting,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.160
and stay up without crashing.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
So I had to give up

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
the approach of drawing

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
the fantasy shapes

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
and convert it to technical drawings --

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
the shape of the wing, the shape of the fuselage and so on --

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.160
and build an airplane over these drawings

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
that I knew followed some of the principles

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
of flying.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
And in so doing, I could produce

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
a model that would fly, stay in the air.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
And it had, once it was in the air,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.160
some of this romance that I was in love with.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Well the act of drawing airplanes

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
led me to,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
when I had the opportunity to choose

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
a course in school,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160
led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.160
And when I was sitting in classes --

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
in which no one asked me to draw an airplane --

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
to my surprise.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
I had to learn mathematics and mechanics

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
and all this sort of thing.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
I'd wile away my time drawing airplanes

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.160
in the class.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
One day a young man looked over my shoulder,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
he said, "You draw very well.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
You should be in the art department."

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
And I said, "Why?"

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
And he said, "Well for one thing, there are more girls there."

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.160
(Laughter)

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
So my romance was temporarily shifted.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.160
(Laughter)

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
And I went into art

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
because they appreciated drawing.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
Studied painting; didn't do very well at that.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
Went through design,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
some architecture.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
Eventually hired myself out as a designer.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
And for the following 25 years,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
living in Italy,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
living in America,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.160
I doled out a piece of this romance

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.160
to anybody who'd pay for it --

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.160
this sense, this aesthetic feeling,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
for the experience revolving around

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
a designed object.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
And it exists.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
Any of you who rode the automobiles --

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
was it yesterday? --

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.160
at the track, you know the romance

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.160
revolving around those high performance cars.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
Well in 25 years

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
I was mostly putting out

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
pieces of this romance

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
and not getting a lot back in

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
because design on call

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.160
doesn't always connect you with a circumstance

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
in which you can produce things of this nature.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
So after 25 years I began to feel

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
as though I was running dry.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
And I quit.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
And I started up a very small operation --

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
went from 40 people

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
to one,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.160
in an effort to rediscover my innocence.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
I wanted to get back

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160
where the romance was.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
And I couldn't choose airplanes

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
because they had gotten sort of unromantic

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
at that point,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
even though I'd done a lot of airplane work,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
on the interiors.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
So I chose furniture.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
And I chose chairs specifically

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
because I knew something about them.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
I'd designed a lot of chairs, over the years

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
for tractors and trucks

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160
and submarines --

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160
all kinds of things.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
But not office chairs.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
So I started doing that.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
And I found that there were ways

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
to duplicate the same approach

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
that I used to use on the airplane.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
Only this time,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
instead of the product being shaped by the wind,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160
it was shaped by the human body.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
So the discipline was --

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
as in the airplane you learn a lot about

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
how to deal with the air,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
for a chair

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
you have to learn a lot about how to deal

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
with the body,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
and what the body needs, wants,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
indicates it needs.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
And that's the way, ultimately

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.160
after some ups and downs,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
I ended up designing the chair I'm going to show you.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.160
I should say one more thing. When I was doing those

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
model airplanes,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
I did everything.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
I conceived the kind of airplane.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
I basically engineered it.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
I built it.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
And I flew it.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
And that's the way I work now.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
When I started this chair

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
it was not a preconceived notion.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
Design nowadays, if you mean it,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.160
you don't start with styling sketches.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
I started with a lot of loose ideas,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
roughly eight or nine years ago.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
And the loose ideas had something

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
to do with what I knew happened with

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
people in the office,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
at the work place -- people who worked,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
and used task seating,

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
a great many of them sitting in front of a computer

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
all day long.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
And I felt,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
the one thing they don't need,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
is a chair that interferes

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
with their main reason for sitting there.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
So I took the approach

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.160
that the chair should do as much for them

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
as humanly possible

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.160
or as mechanistically possible

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
so that they didn't have to fuss with it.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
So my idea was that,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
instead of sitting down and reaching

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
for a lot of controls,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
that you would sit on the chair,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
and it would automatically balance your weight

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
against the force required

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
to recline.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
Now that may not mean a lot to some of you.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
But you know most good chairs do recline

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
because it's beneficial to open up this joint

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
between your legs and your upper body

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
for better breathing

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
and better flow.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
So that if you sit down

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
on my chair,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
whether you're five feet tall

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
or six foot six,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.160
it always deals with your weight

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.160
and transfers the amount of force required

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
to recline

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
in a way that you don't have to look

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
for something to adjust.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
I'll tell you right up front,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
this is a trade off.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
There are drawbacks to this.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
One is: you can't

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
accommodate everybody.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
There are some very light people,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
some extremely heavy people,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.160
maybe people with a lot of bulk up top.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
They begin to fall off the end of your chart.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
But the compromise, I felt,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
was in my favor

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
because most people don't adjust their chairs.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
They will sit in them forever.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160
I had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160
tell me about his sister calling him.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
He said she had one of the new, better chairs.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
She said, "Oh I love it."

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
She said, "But it's too high."

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
(Laughter)

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
So he said, "Well I'll come over and look at it."

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
He came over and looked at it.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.160
He reached down. He pulled a lever. And the chair sank down.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
She said, "Oh it's wonderful. How did you do that?"

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
And he showed her the lever.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
Well, that's typical

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
of a lot of us working in chairs.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
And why should you

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
get a 20-page manual

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
about how to run a chair?

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.160
(Laughter)

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.160
I had one for a wristwatch once. 20 pages.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
Anyway, I felt that it was important

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
that you didn't have to make an adjustment

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
in order to get this kind of action.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
The other thing I felt was that armrests

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.160
had never really been properly approached

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
from the standpoint of how much

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
of an aid they could be

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
to your work life.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
But I felt it was too much to ask

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
to have to adjust each individual armrest

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
in order to get it where you wanted.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160
So I spent a long time.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
I said I worked eight or nine years on it.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
And each of these things went along

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
sort of in parallel

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
but incrementally were a problem of their own.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
I worked a long time on figuring out

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.160
how to move the arms over a much greater arc --

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.160
that is up and down --

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
and make them a lot easier,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
so that you didn't have to use a button.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
And so after many trials, many failures,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
we came up with a very simple arrangement

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
in which we could just move

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
one arm or the other.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
And they go up easily.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
And stop where you want.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
You can put them down, essentially out of the way.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
No arms at all.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
Or you can pull them up where you want them.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.160
And this was another thing that I felt,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
while not nearly as romantic

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
as Cary Grant,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160
nevertheless begins to

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.160
grab a little bit of aesthetic

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.160
operation, aesthetic performance

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.160
into a product.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.160
The next area that was of interest to me

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
was the fact that reclining

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
was a very important factor.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160
And the more you can recline,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.160
in a way, the better it is.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
The more the angle between here and here opens up --

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160
and nowadays, with a screen in front of you,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.160
so we keep it at more or less the same level --

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.160
but you transfer weight

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
off your tailbones.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
Would everybody put their hand under their bottom

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.160
and feel their tailbone?

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.160
(Laughter)

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
You feel that bone under there?

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.160
(Laughter)

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
Just your own.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.160
(Laughter)

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.160
There's two of them, one on either side.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
All the weight of your upper torso --

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
your arms, your head --

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.160
goes right down through your back,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.160
your spine, into those bones when you sit.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160
And that's a lot of load.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
Just relieving your arms with armrests

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
takes 20 percent of that load off.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.160
Now that, if your spine is not held in a good position,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.160
will help bend your spine the wrong way, and so on.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
So to unload

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.160
that great weight --

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.160
if that indeed exists --

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
you can recline.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
When you recline you take away a lot of that load

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
off your bottom end, and transfer it to your back.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
At the same time, as I say, you open up this joint.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
And breathability is good.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.160
But to do that, if you have any

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.160
amount of recline,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
it gets to the point where you need a headrest

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.160
because nearly always,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
automatically hold your head

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
in a vertical position, see?

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.160
As I recline, my head says more or less vertical.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
Well if you're reclined a great deal,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
you have to use muscle force

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
to hold your head there.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
So that's where a headrest comes in.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
Now headrest is a challenge

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160
because you want it to adjust

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.160
enough so that it'll fit,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.160
you know, a tall guy and a short girl.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
So here we are.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.160
I've got five inches of adjustment here

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
in order to get the headrest in the right place.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
But then I knew from experience

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
and looking around in offices

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
where there were chairs with headrests

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160
that nobody would ever bother

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
to reach back and turn a knob

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
and adjust the headrest to put it in position.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
And you need it in a different position

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.160
when you're upright, then when you're reclined.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.160
So I knew that had to be solved, and had to be automatic.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
So if you watch this chair

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
as I recline, the headrest comes up

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
to meet my neck.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.160
Ideally you want to put the head support

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.160
in the cranial area, right there.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:20.160
So that part of it took a long time

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
to work out.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.160
And there is a variety of other things: the shape of the cushions,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160
the gel we put.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
We stole the idea from bicycle seats,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
and put gel in the cushions

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160
and in the armrests

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.160
to absorb point load --

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.160
distributes the loading so you don't get hard spots.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.160
You cant hit your elbow

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.160
on bottom.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.160
And I did want to demonstrate

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.160
the fact that the chair can accommodate people.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.160
While you're sitting in it you can adjust it

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.160
down for the five-footer,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.160
or you can adjust it

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.160
for the six-foot-six guy --

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:13.160
all within the scope of a few simple adjustments.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
(Applause)
