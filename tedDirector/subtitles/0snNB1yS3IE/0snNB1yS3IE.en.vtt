00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:18.704
If I should have a daughter,

00:00:18.728 --> 00:00:20.839
instead of "Mom,"

00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:24.164
she's going to call me "Point B,"

00:00:24.188 --> 00:00:26.815
because that way she knows
that no matter what happens,

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.236
at least she can always find
her way to me.

00:00:29.783 --> 00:00:33.180
And I'm going to paint solar systems
on the backs of her hands

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:35.142
so she has to learn the entire universe

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.260
before she can say, "Oh, I know that
like the back of my hand."

00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:40.236
And she's going to learn

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.236
that this life will hit you
hard in the face,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.555
wait for you to get back up just
so it can kick you in the stomach.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.491
But getting the wind knocked out of you

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.361
is the only way to remind your lungs

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:52.236
how much they like the taste of air.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.536
There is hurt, here,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.900
that cannot be fixed
by Band-Aids or poetry.

00:00:56.924 --> 00:01:00.236
So the first time she realizes
that Wonder Woman isn't coming,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.774
I'll make sure she knows

00:01:01.798 --> 00:01:04.197
she doesn't have to wear
the cape all by herself,

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:06.711
because no matter how wide
you stretch your fingers,

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:08.410
your hands will always be too small

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.951
to catch all the pain you want to heal.

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:12.954
Believe me, I've tried.

00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:14.273
"And, baby," I'll tell her,

00:01:14.297 --> 00:01:16.415
don't keep your nose up
in the air like that.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.713
I know that trick;
I've done it a million times.

00:01:18.737 --> 00:01:20.236
You're just smelling for smoke

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.236
so you can follow the trail
back to a burning house,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.879
so you can find the boy
who lost everything in the fire

00:01:25.903 --> 00:01:27.235
to see if you can save him.

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:31.236
Or else find the boy who lit
the fire in the first place,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.737
to see if you can change him.

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:35.236
But I know she will anyway,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.308
so instead I'll always keep
an extra supply

00:01:37.332 --> 00:01:39.450
of chocolate and rain boots nearby,

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:42.363
because there is no heartbreak
that chocolate can't fix.

00:01:43.418 --> 00:01:45.561
Okay, there's a few
that chocolate can't fix.

00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:47.823
But that's what the rain boots are for,

00:01:47.847 --> 00:01:51.236
because rain will wash away
everything, if you let it.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.236
I want her to look at the world

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.842
through the underside
of a glass-bottom boat,

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.236
to look through a microscope

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.236
at the galaxies that exist

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.435
on the pinpoint of a human mind,

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.467
because that's the way my mom taught me.

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:05.236
That there'll be days like this.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.236
(Singing) There'll be days
like this, my momma said.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.236
When you open your hands to catch

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.807
and wind up with only
blisters and bruises;

00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:15.236
when you step out of the phone
booth and try to fly

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.137
and the very people you want to save

00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:18.900
are the ones standing on your cape;

00:02:18.924 --> 00:02:20.828
when your boots will fill with rain,

00:02:20.852 --> 00:02:23.236
and you'll be up to your knees
in disappointment.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.762
And those are the very days you have
all the more reason to say thank you.

00:02:26.786 --> 00:02:28.641
Because there's nothing more beautiful

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:31.526
than the way the ocean refuses
to stop kissing the shoreline,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.792
no matter how many times it's sent away.

00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:37.847
You will put the wind
in win some, lose some.

00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:41.236
You will put the star
in starting over, and over.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.236
And no matter how many land
mines erupt in a minute,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.886
be sure your mind lands

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.267
on the beauty of this
funny place called life.

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:51.053
And yes, on a scale
from one to over-trusting,

00:02:51.077 --> 00:02:53.236
I am pretty damn naive.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.759
But I want her to know
that this world is made out of sugar.

00:02:56.783 --> 00:02:58.236
It can crumble so easily,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.236
but don't be afraid to stick
your tongue out and taste it.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.236
"Baby," I'll tell her, "remember,
your momma is a worrier,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.094
and your poppa is a warrior,

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:08.480
and you are the girl
with small hands and big eyes

00:03:08.504 --> 00:03:10.236
who never stops asking for more."

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.839
Remember that good things come in threes

00:03:12.863 --> 00:03:14.282
and so do bad things.

00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:17.648
Always apologize when
you've done something wrong,

00:03:17.672 --> 00:03:19.053
but don't you ever apologize

00:03:19.077 --> 00:03:21.236
for the way your eyes
refuse to stop shining.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.236
Your voice is small,
but don't ever stop singing.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.236
And when they finally hand you heartache,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.236
when they slip war
and hatred under your door

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.236
and offer you handouts on street-corners

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.236
of cynicism and defeat,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.388
you tell them that they really
ought to meet your mother.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.831
(Applause)

00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:43.236
Thank you. Thank you.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.585
(Applause)

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:47.973
Thank you.

00:03:47.997 --> 00:03:50.156
(Applause)

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.269
Thanks.

00:03:52.293 --> 00:03:55.441
(Applause)

00:03:55.553 --> 00:03:56.736
Thank you.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.236
(Applause)

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.236
All right, so I want you to take a moment,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.236
and I want you to think of three things
that you know to be true.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.236
They can be about whatever you want --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.818
technology, entertainment, design,

00:04:11.842 --> 00:04:13.771
your family, what you had for breakfast.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.763
The only rule is don't think too hard.

00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:18.260
Okay, ready? Go.

00:04:24.982 --> 00:04:25.990
Okay.

00:04:26.387 --> 00:04:28.594
So here are three things
I know to be true.

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:31.649
I know that Jean-Luc Godard
was right when he said that,

00:04:31.673 --> 00:04:34.697
"A good story has a beginning,
a middle and an end,

00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:37.008
although not necessarily in that order."

00:04:37.032 --> 00:04:40.236
I know that I'm incredibly nervous
and excited to be up here,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.261
which is greatly inhibiting
my ability to keep it cool.

00:04:43.285 --> 00:04:44.618
(Laughter)

00:04:44.642 --> 00:04:46.236
And I know

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.984
that I have been waiting
all week to tell this joke.

00:04:49.596 --> 00:04:51.152
(Laughter)

00:04:51.176 --> 00:04:53.350
Why was the scarecrow invited to TED?

00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:56.541
Because he was out standing in his field.

00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:59.033
(Laughter)

00:04:59.803 --> 00:05:01.372
I'm sorry.

00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:05.661
Okay, so these are three things
I know to be true.

00:05:05.685 --> 00:05:08.868
But there are plenty of things
I have trouble understanding.

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:11.788
So I write poems to figure things out.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.070
Sometimes the only way I know
how to work through something

00:05:15.094 --> 00:05:16.547
is by writing a poem.

00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:18.469
Sometimes I get to the end of the poem,

00:05:18.493 --> 00:05:21.020
look back and go,
"Oh, that's what this is all about,"

00:05:21.044 --> 00:05:23.061
and sometimes I get to the end of the poem

00:05:23.085 --> 00:05:24.420
and haven't solved anything,

00:05:24.444 --> 00:05:26.618
but at least I have a new poem out of it.

00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:29.341
Spoken-word poetry is the art
of performance poetry.

00:05:29.365 --> 00:05:31.812
I tell people it involves creating poetry

00:05:31.836 --> 00:05:33.724
that doesn't just want to sit on paper,

00:05:33.748 --> 00:05:36.557
that something about it
demands it be heard out loud

00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:37.954
or witnessed in person.

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.414
When I was a freshman in high school,

00:05:40.438 --> 00:05:44.236
I was a live wire of nervous hormones.

00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:48.236
And I was underdeveloped
and over-excitable.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.236
And despite my fear

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.426
of ever being looked at for too long,

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.671
I was fascinated by the idea
of spoken-word poetry.

00:05:55.695 --> 00:05:59.335
I felt that my two secret loves,
poetry and theater,

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.288
had come together, had a baby,

00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:03.977
a baby I needed to get to know.

00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:05.946
So I decided to give it a try.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.874
My first spoken-word poem,

00:06:07.898 --> 00:06:11.236
packed with all the wisdom
of a 14-year-old,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.236
was about the injustice

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.826
of being seen as unfeminine.

00:06:15.286 --> 00:06:18.120
The poem was very indignant,

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:19.286
and mainly exaggerated,

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.538
but the only spoken-word poetry
that I had seen up until that point

00:06:22.562 --> 00:06:24.236
was mainly indignant,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.594
so I thought
that's what was expected of me.

00:06:26.618 --> 00:06:28.236
The first time that I performed,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.749
the audience of teenagers hooted
and hollered their sympathy,

00:06:31.773 --> 00:06:34.236
and when I came off the stage,
I was shaking.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.147
I felt this tap on my shoulder,

00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:37.727
and I turned around to see

00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:40.662
this giant girl in a hoodie
sweatshirt emerge from the crowd.

00:06:40.686 --> 00:06:42.101
She was maybe eight feet tall

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:44.583
and looked like she could
beat me up with one hand,

00:06:44.607 --> 00:06:47.684
but instead she just nodded
at me and said,

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.473
"Hey, I really felt that. Thanks."

00:06:50.774 --> 00:06:51.941
And lightning struck.

00:06:52.234 --> 00:06:53.505
I was hooked.

00:06:53.731 --> 00:06:56.999
I discovered this bar
on Manhattan's Lower East Side

00:06:57.023 --> 00:06:59.236
that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.236
and my bewildered,
but supportive, parents took me

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.236
to soak in every ounce
of spoken word that I could.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.236
I was the youngest by at least a decade,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.236
but somehow the poets
at the Bowery Poetry Club

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.481
didn't seem bothered
by the 14-year-old wandering about.

00:07:14.505 --> 00:07:16.030
In fact, they welcomed me.

00:07:16.054 --> 00:07:18.991
And it was here, listening to these poets
share their stories,

00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:22.198
that I learned that spoken-word
poetry didn't have to be indignant,

00:07:22.222 --> 00:07:24.542
it could be fun or painful

00:07:24.566 --> 00:07:26.502
or serious or silly.

00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:29.780
The Bowery Poetry Club became
my classroom and my home,

00:07:29.804 --> 00:07:31.440
and the poets who performed

00:07:31.464 --> 00:07:33.844
encouraged me to share my stories as well.

00:07:33.868 --> 00:07:35.757
Never mind the fact that I was 14.

00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:38.236
They told me, "Write about being 14."

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.979
So I did and stood amazed every week

00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:43.236
when these brilliant, grown-up poets

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.261
laughed with me and groaned their sympathy

00:07:45.285 --> 00:07:48.588
and clapped and told me,
"Hey, I really felt that too."

00:07:49.421 --> 00:07:52.663
Now I can divide my spoken-word journey

00:07:52.687 --> 00:07:54.236
into three steps.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.077
Step one was the moment I said,

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:58.236
"I can. I can do this."

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.447
And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.

00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:02.526
Step two was the moment I said,

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.634
"I will. I will continue.

00:08:04.742 --> 00:08:07.622
I love spoken word. I will keep
coming back week after week."

00:08:07.646 --> 00:08:09.236
And step three began

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.060
when I realized I didn't have
to write indignant poems,

00:08:12.084 --> 00:08:13.482
if that's not what I was.

00:08:13.506 --> 00:08:15.671
There were things
that were specific to me,

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:18.236
and the more that I focused
on those things,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.236
the weirder my poetry got,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.236
but the more that it felt like mine.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.958
It's not just the adage
"Write what you know."

00:08:25.982 --> 00:08:28.807
It's about gathering up
all of the knowledge and experience

00:08:28.831 --> 00:08:30.442
you've collected up to now

00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:33.205
to help you dive into the things
you don't know.

00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:36.112
I use poetry to help me work
through what I don't understand,

00:08:36.136 --> 00:08:38.081
but I show up to each new poem

00:08:38.105 --> 00:08:41.236
with a backpack full
of everywhere else that I've been.

00:08:41.726 --> 00:08:44.451
When I got to university,
I met a fellow poet

00:08:44.475 --> 00:08:47.967
who shared my belief in the magic
of spoken-word poetry.

00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:49.985
And actually, Phil Kaye and I

00:08:50.009 --> 00:08:52.602
coincidentally also share
the same last name.

00:08:52.626 --> 00:08:55.361
When I was in high school I had
created Project V.O.I.C.E.

00:08:55.385 --> 00:08:58.236
as a way to encourage my friends
to do spoken word with me.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.236
But Phil and I decided to reinvent
Project V.O.I.C.E.,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.236
this time changing the mission

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.236
to using spoken-word poetry
as a way to entertain,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.236
educate and inspire.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.975
We stayed full-time students,
but in between we traveled,

00:09:10.999 --> 00:09:12.827
performing and teaching

00:09:12.851 --> 00:09:15.235
nine-year-olds to MFA candidates,

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:18.605
from California to Indiana to India

00:09:18.629 --> 00:09:21.236
to a public high school
just up the street from campus.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.237
And we saw over and over

00:09:23.261 --> 00:09:25.236
the way that spoken-word poetry

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.675
cracks open locks.

00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:31.480
But it turns out sometimes,
poetry can be really scary.

00:09:32.083 --> 00:09:33.575
Turns out sometimes,

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:36.236
you have to trick teenagers
into writing poetry.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.725
So I came up with lists.
Everyone can write lists.

00:09:39.749 --> 00:09:41.775
And the first list that I assign

00:09:41.799 --> 00:09:44.479
is "10 Things I Know to be True."

00:09:45.082 --> 00:09:47.438
And here's what happens,
you would discover it too

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.581
if we all started sharing
our lists out loud.

00:09:49.605 --> 00:09:54.935
At a certain point, you would realize
that someone has the exact same thing,

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:56.936
or one thing very similar,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.236
to something on your list.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.236
And then someone else

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.830
has something the complete
opposite of yours.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Third, someone has something
you've never even heard of before.

00:10:06.284 --> 00:10:09.729
Fourth, someone has something
you thought you knew everything about,

00:10:09.753 --> 00:10:12.236
but they're introducing
a new angle of looking at it.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.308
And I tell people that this is
where great stories start from --

00:10:15.332 --> 00:10:17.460
these four intersections

00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:19.236
of what you're passionate about

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.643
and what others might be invested in.

00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:24.236
And most people respond
really well to this exercise.

00:10:24.936 --> 00:10:27.381
But one of my students,
a freshman named Charlotte,

00:10:27.405 --> 00:10:28.865
was not convinced.

00:10:29.301 --> 00:10:32.927
Charlotte was very good at writing lists,
but she refused to write any poems.

00:10:32.951 --> 00:10:35.239
"Miss," she'd say,
"I'm just not interesting.

00:10:35.263 --> 00:10:37.690
I don't have anything interesting to say."

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:40.236
So I assigned her list after list,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.911
and one day I assigned the list

00:10:41.935 --> 00:10:43.911
"10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now."

00:10:44.553 --> 00:10:46.463
Number three on Charlotte's list was,

00:10:46.487 --> 00:10:48.504
"I should have learned
not to crush on guys

00:10:48.528 --> 00:10:50.003
three times my age."

00:10:50.955 --> 00:10:52.328
I asked her what that meant,

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:54.790
and she said, "Miss,
it's kind of a long story."

00:10:54.814 --> 00:10:57.638
And I said, "Charlotte, it sounds
pretty interesting to me."

00:10:57.662 --> 00:10:59.416
And so she wrote her first poem,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.017
a love poem unlike any
I had ever heard before.

00:11:03.041 --> 00:11:05.462
And the poem began,

00:11:05.486 --> 00:11:07.604
"Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man."

00:11:07.628 --> 00:11:10.097
(Laughter)

00:11:10.121 --> 00:11:11.738
"Did you see him on 60 Minutes,

00:11:11.762 --> 00:11:13.542
racing Michael Phelps in a pool --

00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:15.236
nothing but swim trunks on --

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.392
diving in the water, determined
to beat this swimming champion?

00:11:18.416 --> 00:11:20.805
After the race, he tossed
his wet, cloud-white hair

00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:22.088
and said, 'You're a god.'

00:11:22.112 --> 00:11:24.236
No, Anderson, you're the god."

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.236
(Laughter)

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.133
(Applause)

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.052
Now, I know that the number one
rule to being cool

00:11:34.076 --> 00:11:35.963
is to seem unfazed,

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:39.183
to never admit that anything scares you

00:11:39.207 --> 00:11:40.816
or impresses you or excites you.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.236
Somebody once told me

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.409
it's like walking through life like this.

00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:45.807
You protect yourself

00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:49.069
from all the unexpected miseries
or hurt that might show up.

00:11:49.093 --> 00:11:51.723
But I try to walk through life like this.

00:11:51.747 --> 00:11:54.614
And yes, that means catching
all of those miseries and hurt,

00:11:54.638 --> 00:11:58.364
but it also means
that when beautiful, amazing things

00:11:58.388 --> 00:11:59.805
just fall out of the sky,

00:11:59.829 --> 00:12:01.236
I'm ready to catch them.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.641
I use spoken word to help my students

00:12:03.665 --> 00:12:05.236
rediscover wonder,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.026
to fight their instincts
to be cool and unfazed

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.565
and, instead, actively pursue being
engaged with what goes on around them,

00:12:11.589 --> 00:12:14.882
so that they can reinterpret
and create something from it.

00:12:14.906 --> 00:12:17.199
It's not that I think
that spoken-word poetry

00:12:17.223 --> 00:12:18.699
is the ideal art form.

00:12:18.723 --> 00:12:21.858
I'm always trying to find
the best way to tell each story.

00:12:21.882 --> 00:12:24.907
I write musicals; I make short films
alongside my poems.

00:12:24.931 --> 00:12:27.105
But I teach spoken-word poetry

00:12:27.129 --> 00:12:29.074
because it's accessible.

00:12:29.098 --> 00:12:32.546
Not everyone can read music
or owns a camera,

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.935
but everyone can communicate in some way,

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:38.736
and everyone has stories
that the rest of us can learn from.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.992
Plus, spoken-word poetry allows
for immediate connection.

00:12:42.016 --> 00:12:44.211
It's not uncommon
to feel like you're alone

00:12:44.235 --> 00:12:45.828
or that nobody understands you,

00:12:45.852 --> 00:12:47.236
but spoken word teaches

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.991
that if you have the ability
to express yourself

00:12:50.015 --> 00:12:52.832
and the courage to present
those stories and opinions,

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:54.236
you could be rewarded

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.236
with a room full of your peers,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.546
or your community, who will listen.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.865
And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie

00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:02.935
who will connect with what you've shared.

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:05.236
And that is an amazing
realization to have,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.106
especially when you're 14.

00:13:07.726 --> 00:13:09.236
Plus, now with YouTube,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.902
that connection's not even limited
to the room we're in.

00:13:11.926 --> 00:13:15.148
I'm so lucky that there's
this archive of performances

00:13:15.172 --> 00:13:16.836
that I can share with my students.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.305
It allows for even more opportunities

00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:22.732
for them to find a poet or a poem
that they connect to.

00:13:23.127 --> 00:13:25.594
Once you've figured this out,

00:13:25.618 --> 00:13:27.761
it is tempting to keep
writing the same poem,

00:13:27.785 --> 00:13:29.968
or keep telling the same story,
over and over,

00:13:29.992 --> 00:13:32.571
once you've figured out
that it will gain you applause.

00:13:32.595 --> 00:13:35.578
It's not enough to just teach
that you can express yourself.

00:13:35.602 --> 00:13:37.236
You have to grow and explore

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.557
and take risks and challenge yourself.

00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:42.236
And that is step three:

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.236
infusing the work you're doing

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.308
with the specific things
that make you you,

00:13:46.332 --> 00:13:48.662
even while those things
are always changing.

00:13:48.969 --> 00:13:51.400
Because step three never ends.

00:13:51.809 --> 00:13:53.813
But you don't get to start on step three,

00:13:53.837 --> 00:13:56.001
until you take step one first:

00:13:56.025 --> 00:13:57.038
"I can."

00:13:57.062 --> 00:13:58.784
I travel a lot while I'm teaching,

00:13:58.808 --> 00:14:02.310
and I don't always get to watch
all of my students reach their step three,

00:14:02.334 --> 00:14:04.052
but I was very lucky with Charlotte,

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:06.716
that I got to watch her journey
unfold the way it did.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.072
I watched her realize

00:14:08.096 --> 00:14:11.872
that, by putting the things that she knows
to be true into the work she's doing,

00:14:11.896 --> 00:14:14.336
she can create poems
that only Charlotte can write,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.299
about eyeballs and elevators
and Dora the Explorer.

00:14:17.672 --> 00:14:20.013
And I'm trying to tell
stories only I can tell --

00:14:20.037 --> 00:14:21.236
like this story.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.524
I spent a lot of time thinking
about the best way to tell this story,

00:14:24.548 --> 00:14:25.990
and I wondered if the best way

00:14:26.014 --> 00:14:28.117
was going to be
a PowerPoint, a short film --

00:14:28.141 --> 00:14:30.918
And where exactly was the beginning,
the middle or the end?

00:14:30.942 --> 00:14:33.315
I wondered whether I'd get
to the end of this talk

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:35.893
and finally have
figured it all out, or not.

00:14:36.568 --> 00:14:39.832
And I always thought that my beginning
was at the Bowery Poetry Club,

00:14:39.856 --> 00:14:41.932
but it's possible
that it was much earlier.

00:14:41.956 --> 00:14:43.236
In preparing for TED,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.499
I discovered this diary page
in an old journal.

00:14:45.523 --> 00:14:48.705
I think December 54th
was probably supposed to be 24th.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.236
It's clear that when I was a child,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.513
I definitely walked
through life like this.

00:14:53.537 --> 00:14:54.847
I think that we all did.

00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:58.236
I would like to help others
rediscover that wonder --

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.725
to want to engage with it,
to want to learn,

00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:02.636
to want to share what they've learned,

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.336
what they've figured out to be true

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.336
and what they're still figuring out.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.522
So I'd like to close with this poem.

00:15:10.066 --> 00:15:12.647
When they bombed Hiroshima,

00:15:12.671 --> 00:15:15.726
the explosion formed a mini-supernova,

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.804
so every living animal, human or plant

00:15:18.828 --> 00:15:22.506
that received direct contact
with the rays from that sun

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.126
was instantly turned to ash.

00:15:24.412 --> 00:15:26.501
And what was left
of the city soon followed.

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:28.929
The long-lasting damage
of nuclear radiation

00:15:28.953 --> 00:15:31.870
caused an entire city and its population

00:15:31.894 --> 00:15:33.738
to turn into powder.

00:15:34.406 --> 00:15:38.019
When I was born, my mom says
I looked around the whole hospital room

00:15:38.043 --> 00:15:41.236
with a stare that said,
"This? I've done this before."

00:15:41.684 --> 00:15:43.338
She says I have old eyes.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.236
When my Grandpa Genji died,
I was only five years old,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.409
but I took my mom
by the hand and told her,

00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:50.973
"Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby."

00:15:51.544 --> 00:15:54.708
And yet, for someone
who's apparently done this already,

00:15:54.732 --> 00:15:57.236
I still haven't figured anything out yet.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.236
My knees still buckle
every time I get on a stage.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.236
My self-confidence can be measured out

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.236
in teaspoons mixed into my poetry,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.236
and it still always
tastes funny in my mouth.

00:16:07.562 --> 00:16:10.783
But in Hiroshima, some people
were wiped clean away,

00:16:10.807 --> 00:16:13.561
leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.

00:16:13.585 --> 00:16:17.017
So no matter that I have inhibitions
to fill all my pockets,

00:16:17.041 --> 00:16:18.236
I keep trying,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.236
hoping that one day I'll write a poem

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.403
I can be proud to let sit
in a museum exhibit

00:16:22.427 --> 00:16:24.664
as the only proof I existed.

00:16:25.115 --> 00:16:28.236
My parents named me Sarah,
which is a biblical name.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.617
In the original story, God told Sarah
she could do something impossible, and --

00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:34.339
she laughed,

00:16:34.363 --> 00:16:35.940
because the first Sarah,

00:16:35.964 --> 00:16:38.308
she didn't know what to do
with impossible.

00:16:38.332 --> 00:16:39.532
And me?

00:16:39.716 --> 00:16:41.236
Well, neither do I,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.236
but I see the impossible every day.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.165
Impossible is trying
to connect in this world,

00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:49.293
trying to hold onto others while things
are blowing up around you,

00:16:49.317 --> 00:16:50.993
knowing that while you're speaking,

00:16:51.017 --> 00:16:54.075
they aren't just waiting for their turn
to talk -- they hear you.

00:16:54.099 --> 00:16:55.590
They feel exactly what you feel

00:16:55.614 --> 00:16:57.236
at the same time that you feel it.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.737
It's what I strive for every time
I open my mouth --

00:16:59.761 --> 00:17:01.841
that impossible connection.

00:17:01.865 --> 00:17:04.236
There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.002
that was completely burnt
black by the radiation.

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:09.700
But on the front step,
a person who was sitting there

00:17:09.724 --> 00:17:11.994
blocked the rays from hitting the stone.

00:17:12.018 --> 00:17:13.236
The only thing left now

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.768
is a permanent shadow of positive light.

00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:17.236
After the A-bomb,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.848
specialists said it would take 75 years

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:22.236
for the radiation-damaged
soil of Hiroshima City

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.236
to ever grow anything again.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.625
But that spring, there were
new buds popping up from the earth.

00:17:27.649 --> 00:17:29.652
When I meet you, in that moment,

00:17:29.676 --> 00:17:31.512
I'm no longer a part of your future.

00:17:31.536 --> 00:17:33.775
I start quickly becoming
part of your past.

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:36.236
But in that instant,
I get to share your present.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.236
And you, you get to share mine.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.236
And that is the greatest present of all.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.522
So if you tell me
I can do the impossible --

00:17:43.154 --> 00:17:44.648
I'll probably laugh at you.

00:17:44.672 --> 00:17:46.760
I don't know if I can change
the world yet,

00:17:46.784 --> 00:17:48.803
because I don't know that much about it --

00:17:48.827 --> 00:17:51.417
and I don't know that much
about reincarnation either,

00:17:51.441 --> 00:17:53.285
but if you make me laugh hard enough,

00:17:53.309 --> 00:17:55.537
sometimes I forget what century I'm in.

00:17:55.561 --> 00:17:59.020
This isn't my first time here.
This isn't my last time here.

00:17:59.044 --> 00:18:00.956
These aren't the last words I'll share.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.236
But just in case, I'm trying my hardest

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.671
to get it right this time around.

00:18:06.156 --> 00:18:07.259
Thank you.

00:18:07.283 --> 00:18:09.113
(Applause)

00:18:09.137 --> 00:18:10.169
Thank you.

00:18:10.193 --> 00:18:13.426
(Applause)

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.597
Thank you.

00:18:14.621 --> 00:18:17.458
(Applause)

00:18:17.482 --> 00:18:18.602
Thank you.

00:18:18.626 --> 00:18:20.950
(Applause)
