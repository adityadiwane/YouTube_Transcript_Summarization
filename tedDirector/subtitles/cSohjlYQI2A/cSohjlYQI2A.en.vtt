00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:17.601
We are losing our listening.

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.680
We spend roughly 60 percent
of our communication time listening,

00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:24.236
but we're not very good at it.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.767
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear.

00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:28.293
Now -- not you, not this talk,

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:29.842
but that is generally true.

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.016
(Laughter)

00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:34.553
Let's define listening
as making meaning from sound.

00:00:34.892 --> 00:00:36.471
It's a mental process,

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:38.717
and it's a process of extraction.

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:41.306
We use some pretty cool
techniques to do this.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.069
One of them is pattern recognition.

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:45.445
(Crowd noises) So in a cocktail
party like this,

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.754
if I say, "David, Sara, pay attention" --
some of you just sat up.

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:53.447
We recognize patterns
to distinguish noise from signal,

00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:54.986
and especially our name.

00:00:55.511 --> 00:00:57.550
Differencing is another technique we use.

00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:00.730
If I left this pink noise on
for more than a couple of minutes,

00:01:00.754 --> 00:01:03.328
(Pink noise) you would literally
cease to hear it.

00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:07.439
We listen to differences;
we discount sounds that remain the same.

00:01:08.312 --> 00:01:11.101
And then there is a whole
range of filters.

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:13.577
These filters take us from all sound

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:15.672
down to what we pay attention to.

00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:19.755
Most people are entirely
unconscious of these filters.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:22.329
But they actually create
our reality in a way,

00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:25.360
because they tell us what
we're paying attention to right now.

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:27.150
I'll give you one example of that.

00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:30.081
Intention is very important
in sound, in listening.

00:01:30.494 --> 00:01:32.236
When I married my wife,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.920
I promised her I would listen
to her every day

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:36.467
as if for the first time.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.486
Now that's something
I fall short of on a daily basis.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.523
(Laughter)

00:01:41.547 --> 00:01:44.145
But it's a great intention
to have in a relationship.

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:45.854
(Laughter)

00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:47.029
But that's not all.

00:01:47.053 --> 00:01:49.636
Sound places us in space and in time.

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:52.958
If you close your eyes
right now in this room,

00:01:52.982 --> 00:01:54.989
you're aware of the size of the room

00:01:55.013 --> 00:01:58.831
from the reverberation and the bouncing
of the sound off the surfaces;

00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:01.122
you're aware of how many
people are around you,

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:03.741
because of the micro-noises
you're receiving.

00:02:03.765 --> 00:02:06.348
And sound places us in time as well,

00:02:06.372 --> 00:02:09.832
because sound always has
time embedded in it.

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:12.778
In fact, I would suggest
that our listening is the main way

00:02:12.802 --> 00:02:14.948
that we experience the flow of time

00:02:14.972 --> 00:02:16.359
from past to future.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.995
So, "Sonority is time
and meaning" -- a great quote.

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.460
I said at the beginning,
we're losing our listening.

00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:23.894
Why did I say that?

00:02:23.918 --> 00:02:25.952
Well, there are a lot of reasons for this.

00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:28.181
First of all, we invented
ways of recording --

00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:31.947
first writing, then audio recording
and now video recording as well.

00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:36.236
The premium on accurate and careful
listening has simply disappeared.

00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:39.236
Secondly, the world is now so noisy,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.236
(Noise) with this cacophony
going on visually and auditorily,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.236
it's just hard to listen;

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.402
it's tiring to listen.

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:50.875
Many people take refuge in headphones,

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.952
but they turn big,
public spaces like this,

00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:55.372
shared soundscapes,

00:02:55.396 --> 00:02:59.468
into millions of tiny,
little personal sound bubbles.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.520
In this scenario,
nobody's listening to anybody.

00:03:03.147 --> 00:03:04.702
We're becoming impatient.

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:08.236
We don't want oratory anymore;
we want sound bites.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.705
And the art of conversation is being
replaced -- dangerously, I think --

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:14.716
by personal broadcasting.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.207
I don't know how much listening
there is in this conversation,

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.020
which is sadly very common,
especially in the UK.

00:03:21.715 --> 00:03:23.386
We're becoming desensitized.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.865
Our media have to scream at us
with these kinds of headlines

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.475
in order to get our attention.

00:03:28.881 --> 00:03:31.312
And that means it's harder
for us to pay attention

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:34.142
to the quiet, the subtle, the understated.

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:38.508
This is a serious problem
that we're losing our listening.

00:03:38.532 --> 00:03:39.904
This is not trivial,

00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:44.202
because listening is our access
to understanding.

00:03:44.226 --> 00:03:47.687
Conscious listening
always creates understanding,

00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:49.910
and only without conscious listening

00:03:50.365 --> 00:03:51.886
can these things happen.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.222
A world where we don't listen
to each other at all

00:03:55.246 --> 00:03:58.037
is a very scary place indeed.

00:03:59.014 --> 00:04:02.336
So I'd like to share with you
five simple exercises,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.050
tools you can take away with you,

00:04:04.074 --> 00:04:06.266
to improve your own conscious listening.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.446
Would you like that?

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.636
Audience: Yes!

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.949
Good. The first one is silence.

00:04:11.612 --> 00:04:15.236
Just three minutes a day of silence
is a wonderful exercise

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.972
to reset your ears and to recalibrate,

00:04:17.996 --> 00:04:20.099
so that you can hear the quiet again.

00:04:20.123 --> 00:04:21.798
If you can't get absolute silence,

00:04:21.822 --> 00:04:24.202
go for quiet, that's absolutely fine.

00:04:24.823 --> 00:04:27.092
Second, I call this "the mixer."

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.009
(Noise) So even if you're
in a noisy environment like this --

00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:33.758
and we all spend a lot of time
in places like this --

00:04:33.782 --> 00:04:37.854
listen in the coffee bar
to how many channels of sound can I hear?

00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:40.836
How many individual channels
in that mix am I listening to?

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.074
You can do it in a beautiful place
as well, like in a lake.

00:04:44.098 --> 00:04:45.585
How many birds am I hearing?

00:04:45.609 --> 00:04:47.815
Where are they? Where are those ripples?

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:51.567
It's a great exercise for improving
the quality of your listening.

00:04:52.456 --> 00:04:56.236
Third, this exercise I call "savoring,"
and this is a beautiful exercise.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.236
It's about enjoying mundane sounds.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.489
This, for example, is my tumble dryer.

00:05:01.513 --> 00:05:02.611
(Dryer)

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:07.117
It's a waltz -- one, two, three;
one, two, three; one, two, three.

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:08.363
I love it!

00:05:08.387 --> 00:05:10.559
Or just try this one on for size.

00:05:10.583 --> 00:05:17.532
(Coffee grinder)

00:05:19.713 --> 00:05:20.872
Wow!

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.639
So, mundane sounds
can be really interesting --

00:05:23.663 --> 00:05:24.856
if you pay attention.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.082
I call that the "hidden choir" --
it's around us all the time.

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:32.217
The next exercise is probably
the most important of all of these,

00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:33.912
if you just take one thing away.

00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:35.557
This is listening positions --

00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:38.503
the idea that you can move
your listening position

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.875
to what's appropriate
to what you're listening to.

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:43.645
This is playing with those filters.

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.323
Remember I gave you those filters?

00:05:45.347 --> 00:05:47.374
It's starting to play with them as levers,

00:05:47.398 --> 00:05:50.275
to get conscious about them
and to move to different places.

00:05:50.299 --> 00:05:52.538
These are just some
of the listening positions,

00:05:52.562 --> 00:05:54.969
or scales of listening
positions, that you can use.

00:05:54.993 --> 00:05:56.159
There are many.

00:05:56.183 --> 00:05:58.292
Have fun with that. It's very exciting.

00:05:58.685 --> 00:06:00.787
And finally, an acronym.

00:06:00.811 --> 00:06:03.706
You can use this in listening,
in communication.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.946
If you're in any one of those roles --

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.741
and I think that probably is everybody
who's listening to this talk --

00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:11.448
the acronym is RASA,

00:06:11.472 --> 00:06:15.066
which is the Sanskrit word
for "juice" or "essence."

00:06:15.503 --> 00:06:20.312
And RASA stands for "Receive,"
which means pay attention to the person;

00:06:20.336 --> 00:06:23.738
"Appreciate," making little noises
like "hmm," "oh," "OK";

00:06:23.762 --> 00:06:27.149
"Summarize" -- the word "so"
is very important in communication;

00:06:27.173 --> 00:06:29.618
and "Ask," ask questions afterwards.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.552
Now sound is my passion, it's my life.

00:06:32.576 --> 00:06:35.110
I wrote a whole book about it.
So I live to listen.

00:06:35.134 --> 00:06:37.461
That's too much to ask for most people.

00:06:38.014 --> 00:06:41.961
But I believe that every human being
needs to listen consciously

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.722
in order to live fully --

00:06:44.115 --> 00:06:47.805
connected in space and in time
to the physical world around us,

00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:50.355
connected in understanding to each other,

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:52.201
not to mention spiritually connected,

00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:56.037
because every spiritual path
I know of has listening and contemplation

00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.234
at its heart.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.236
That's why we need to teach listening
in our schools as a skill.

00:07:03.777 --> 00:07:05.587
Why is it not taught? It's crazy.

00:07:06.174 --> 00:07:08.633
And if we can teach listening
in our schools,

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:11.395
we can take our listening
off that slippery slope

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:13.965
to that dangerous, scary world
that I talked about,

00:07:13.989 --> 00:07:17.717
and move it to a place where everybody
is consciously listening all the time,

00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:19.521
or at least capable of doing it.

00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:21.426
Now, I don't know how to do that,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.733
but this is TED,

00:07:23.447 --> 00:07:26.517
and I think the TED community
is capable of anything.

00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:29.801
So I invite you to connect with me,
connect with each other,

00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:31.030
take this mission out.

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:33.107
And let's get listening taught in schools,

00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:35.129
and transform the world in one generation

00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:37.875
to a conscious, listening world --
a world of connection,

00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:39.236
a world of understanding

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.512
and a world of peace.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.665
Thank you for listening to me today.

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:45.013
(Applause)
