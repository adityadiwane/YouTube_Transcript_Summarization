00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Thank you very much.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Please excuse me for sitting; I'm very old.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
(Laughter)

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Well, the topic I'm going to discuss

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
is one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
because it's very old.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Roughness is part of human life

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
forever and forever,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and ancient authors have written about it.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
It was very much uncontrollable,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and in a certain sense,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
it seemed to be the extreme of complexity,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
just a mess, a mess and a mess.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
There are many different kinds of mess.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
Now, in fact,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
by a complete fluke,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
I got involved many years ago

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
in a study of this form of complexity,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
and to my utter amazement,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
I found traces --

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
very strong traces, I must say --

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
of order in that roughness.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And so today, I would like to present to you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
a few examples

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
of what this represents.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
I prefer the word roughness

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
to the word irregularity

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
because irregularity --

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
to someone who had Latin

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
in my long-past youth --

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
means the contrary of regularity.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
But it is not so.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
Regularity is the contrary of roughness

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
because the basic aspect of the world

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
is very rough.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
So let me show you a few objects.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Some of them are artificial.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Others of them are very real, in a certain sense.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Now this is the real. It's a cauliflower.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Now why do I show a cauliflower,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
a very ordinary and ancient vegetable?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Because old and ancient as it may be,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
it's very complicated and it's very simple,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
both at the same time.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
If you try to weigh it -- of course it's very easy to weigh it,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and when you eat it, the weight matters --

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
but suppose you try to

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
measure its surface.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Well, it's very interesting.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
If you cut, with a sharp knife,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
one of the florets of a cauliflower

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and look at it separately,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
you think of a whole cauliflower, but smaller.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And then you cut again,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
and you still get small cauliflowers.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
So the experience of humanity

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
has always been that there are some shapes

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
which have this peculiar property,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
that each part is like the whole,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
but smaller.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Now, what did humanity do with that?

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Very, very little.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
(Laughter)

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
So what I did actually is to

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
study this problem,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and I found something quite surprising.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
That one can measure roughness

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
by a number, a number,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
2.3, 1.2 and sometimes much more.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
One day, a friend of mine,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
to bug me,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
brought a picture and said,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
"What is the roughness of this curve?"

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
I said, "Well, just short of 1.5."

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
It was 1.48.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Now, it didn't take me any time.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
I've been looking at these things for so long.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
So these numbers are the numbers

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
which denote the roughness of these surfaces.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
I hasten to say that these surfaces

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
are completely artificial.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
They were done on a computer,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and the only input is a number,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
and that number is roughness.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
So on the left,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
I took the roughness copied from many landscapes.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
To the right, I took a higher roughness.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
So the eye, after a while,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
can distinguish these two very well.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
This is very rough, and this is sort of smooth, and this perfectly smooth.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Very few things are very smooth.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
So then if you try to ask questions:

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
"What's the surface of a cauliflower?"

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
Well, you measure and measure and measure.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Each time you're closer, it gets bigger,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
down to very, very small distances.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
What's the length of the coastline

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
of these lakes?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
The closer you measure, the longer it is.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
The concept of length of coastline,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
which seems to be so natural

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
because it's given in many cases,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
is, in fact, complete fallacy; there's no such thing.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
You must do it differently.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
What good is that, to know these things?

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Well, surprisingly enough,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
it's good in many ways.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
To begin with, artificial landscapes,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
which I invented sort of,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
are used in cinema all the time.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
We see mountains in the distance.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
They may be mountains, but they may be just formulae, just cranked on.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Now it's very easy to do.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
It used to be very time-consuming, but now it's nothing.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Now look at that. That's a real lung.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Now a lung is something very strange.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
If you take this thing,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
you know very well it weighs very little.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
The volume of a lung is very small,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
but what about the area of the lung?

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Anatomists were arguing very much about that.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Some say that a normal male's lung

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
has an area of the inside

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
of a basketball [court].

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And the others say, no, five basketball [courts].

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Enormous disagreements.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Why so? Because, in fact, the area of the lung

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
is something very ill-defined.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
The bronchi branch, branch, branch

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and they stop branching,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
not because of any matter of principle,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
but because of physical considerations:

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
the mucus, which is in the lung.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
So what happens is that in a way

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
you have a much bigger lung,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
but it branches and branches

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
down to distances about the same for a whale, for a man

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and for a little rodent.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Now, what good is it to have that?

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
Well, surprisingly enough, amazingly enough,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
the anatomists had a very poor idea

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
of the structure of the lung until very recently.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And I think that my mathematics,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
surprisingly enough,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
has been of great help

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
to the surgeons

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
studying lung illnesses

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and also kidney illnesses,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
all these branching systems,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
for which there was no geometry.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
So I found myself, in other words,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
constructing a geometry,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
a geometry of things which had no geometry.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And a surprising aspect of it

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
is that very often, the rules of this geometry

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
are extremely short.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
You have formulas that long.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
And you crank it several times.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Sometimes repeatedly: again, again, again,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
the same repetition.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And at the end, you get things like that.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
This cloud is completely,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
100 percent artificial.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Well, 99.9.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
And the only part which is natural

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
is a number, the roughness of the cloud,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
which is taken from nature.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Something so complicated like a cloud,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
so unstable, so varying,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
should have a simple rule behind it.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Now this simple rule

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
is not an explanation of clouds.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
The seer of clouds had to

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
take account of it.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
I don't know how much advanced

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
these pictures are. They're old.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
I was very much involved in it,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
but then turned my attention to other phenomena.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
Now, here is another thing

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
which is rather interesting.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
One of the shattering events

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
in the history of mathematics,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
which is not appreciated by many people,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
occurred about 130 years ago,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
145 years ago.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Mathematicians began to create

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
shapes that didn't exist.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Mathematicians got into self-praise

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
to an extent which was absolutely amazing,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
that man can invent things

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
that nature did not know.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
In particular, it could invent

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
things like a curve which fills the plane.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
A curve's a curve, a plane's a plane,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
and the two won't mix.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
Well, they do mix.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
A man named Peano

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
did define such curves,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
and it became an object of extraordinary interest.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
It was very important, but mostly interesting

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
because a kind of break,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
a separation between

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
the mathematics coming from reality, on the one hand,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
and new mathematics coming from pure man's mind.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
Well, I was very sorry to point out

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
that the pure man's mind

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
has, in fact,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
seen at long last

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
what had been seen for a long time.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
And so here I introduce something,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
the set of rivers of a plane-filling curve.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And well,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
it's a story unto itself.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
So it was in 1875 to 1925,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
an extraordinary period

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And the objects which were used

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
as examples, when I was

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
a child and a student, as examples

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
of the break between mathematics

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
and visible reality --

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
those objects,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
I turned them completely around.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
I used them for describing

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
some of the aspects of the complexity of nature.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Well, a man named Hausdorff in 1919

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
and I found that this number

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
was a good measurement of roughness.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
When I first told it to my friends in mathematics

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
they said, "Don't be silly. It's just something [silly]."

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
Well actually, I was not silly.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
The great painter Hokusai knew it very well.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
The things on the ground are algae.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
He did not know the mathematics; it didn't yet exist.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
But painting for a long time had a fractal side.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
I could speak of that for a long time.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
This is a mess, mess, mess, Brownian loop.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
One day I decided --

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
halfway through my career,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
I was held by so many things in my work --

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
I decided to test myself.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
Could I just look at something

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
which everybody had been looking at for a long time

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
and find something dramatically new?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Well, so I looked at these

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
things called Brownian motion -- just goes around.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
I played with it for a while,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
and I made it return to the origin.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
Then I was telling my assistant,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
"I don't see anything. Can you paint it?"

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
So he painted it, which means

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
he put inside everything. He said:

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
"Well, this thing came out ..." And I said, "Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
I see; it's an island."

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
And amazing.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
So Brownian motion, which happens to have

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
a roughness number of two, goes around.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
I measured it, 1.33.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Again, again, again.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
Long measurements, big Brownian motions,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
1.33.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
Mathematical problem: how to prove it?

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
It took my friends 20 years.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
Three of them were having incomplete proofs.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
They got together, and together they had the proof.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
So they got the big [Fields] medal in mathematics,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
one of the three medals that people have received

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
for proving things which I've seen

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
without being able to prove them.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Now everybody asks me at one point or another,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
"How did it all start?

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
What got you in that strange business?"

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
What got you to be,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
at the same time, a mechanical engineer,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
a geographer

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
and a mathematician and so on, a physicist?

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
Well actually I started, oddly enough,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
studying stock market prices.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
And so here

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
I had this theory,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
and I wrote books about it --

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
financial prices increments.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
To the left you see data over a long period.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
To the right, on top,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
you see a theory which is very, very fashionable.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
It was very easy, and you can write many books very fast about it.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
(Laughter)

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
There are thousands of books on that.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
Now compare that with real price increments.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Where are real price increments?

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
Well, these other lines

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
include some real price increments

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
and some forgery which I did.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
So the idea there was

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
that one must be able to -- how do you say? --

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
model price variation.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
And it went really well 50 years ago.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
For 50 years, people were sort of pooh-poohing me

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
because they could do it much, much easier.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
But I tell you, at this point, people listened to me.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
(Laughter)

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
These two curves are averages:

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Standard &amp; Poor, the blue one;

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
and the red one is Standard &amp; Poor's

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
from which the five biggest discontinuities

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
are taken out.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Now discontinuities are a nuisance,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
so in many studies of prices,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
one puts them aside.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
"Well, acts of God.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
And you have the little nonsense which is left.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Acts of God." In this picture,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
five acts of God are as important as everything else.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
In other words,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
it is not acts of God that we should put aside.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
That is the meat, the problem.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
If you master these, you master price,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
and if you don't master these, you can master

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
the little noise as well as you can,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
but it's not important.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
Well, here are the curves for it.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Now, I get to the final thing, which is the set

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
of which my name is attached.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
In a way, it's the story of my life.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
My adolescence was spent

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
during the German occupation of France.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
Since I thought that I might

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
vanish within a day or a week,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
I had very big dreams.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
And after the war,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
I saw an uncle again.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
My uncle was a very prominent mathematician, and he told me,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
"Look, there's a problem

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
which I could not solve 25 years ago,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
and which nobody can solve.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
This is a construction of a man named [Gaston] Julia

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
and [Pierre] Fatou.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
If you could

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
find something new, anything,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
you will get your career made."

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
Very simple.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
So I looked,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
and like the thousands of people that had tried before,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
I found nothing.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
But then the computer came,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
and I decided to apply the computer,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
not to new problems in mathematics --

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
like this wiggle wiggle, that's a new problem --

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
but to old problems.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
And I went from what's called

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
real numbers, which are points on a line,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
to imaginary, complex numbers,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
which are points on a plane,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
which is what one should do there,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and this shape came out.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
This shape is of an extraordinary complication.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
The equation is hidden there,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
z goes into z squared, plus c.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
It's so simple, so dry.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
It's so uninteresting.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
Now you turn the crank once, twice:

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
twice,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
marvels come out.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
I mean this comes out.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
I don't want to explain these things.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
This comes out. This comes out.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
Shapes which are of such complication,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
such harmony and such beauty.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
This comes out

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
repeatedly, again, again, again.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
And that was one of my major discoveries,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
to find that these islands were the same

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
as the whole big thing, more or less.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
And then you get these

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
All that from this little formula,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
which has whatever, five symbols in it.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
And then this one.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
The color was added for two reasons.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
First of all, because these shapes

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
are so complicated

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
And if you plot them, you must choose some system.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
And so my principle has been

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
to always present the shapes

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
with different colorings

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
because some colorings emphasize that,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
and others it is that or that.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
It's so complicated.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
(Laughter)

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
In 1990, I was in Cambridge, U.K.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
to receive a prize from the university,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
and three days later,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
So where did this come from?

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
Obviously, from extraterrestrials.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
(Laughter)

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
Well, so the newspaper in Cambridge

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
published an article about that "discovery"

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
and received the next day

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
5,000 letters from people saying,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
"But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big."

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
Well, let me finish.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
This shape here just came

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
out of an exercise in pure mathematics.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
which are repeated without end.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
Thank you very much.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:17:02.260
(Applause)
