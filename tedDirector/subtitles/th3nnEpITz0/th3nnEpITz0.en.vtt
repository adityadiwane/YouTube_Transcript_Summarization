00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.071
Here's a startling fact:

00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:18.816
in the 45 years since the introduction
of the automated teller machine,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.696
those vending machines that dispense cash,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.896
the number of human bank tellers
employed in the United States

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.176
has roughly doubled,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.496
from about a quarter of a million
to a half a million.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.556
A quarter of a million in 1970
to about a half a million today,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.816
with 100,000 added since the year 2000.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.256
These facts, revealed in a recent book

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.416
by Boston University
economist James Bessen,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.616
raise an intriguing question:

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.536
what are all those tellers doing,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.576
and why hasn't automation
eliminated their employment by now?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.936
If you think about it,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.096
many of the great inventions
of the last 200 years

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.920
were designed to replace human labor.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.496
Tractors were developed

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.856
to substitute mechanical power
for human physical toil.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.216
Assembly lines were engineered

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.576
to replace inconsistent human handiwork

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.536
with machine perfection.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.776
Computers were programmed to swap out

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.456
error-prone, inconsistent
human calculation

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.240
with digital perfection.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.936
These inventions have worked.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.016
We no longer dig ditches by hand,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.096
pound tools out of wrought iron

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.400
or do bookkeeping using actual books.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.976
And yet, the fraction of US adults
employed in the labor market

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.856
is higher now in 2016

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.616
than it was 125 years ago, in 1890,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.656
and it's risen in just about every decade

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.000
in the intervening 125 years.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.240
This poses a paradox.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.816
Our machines increasingly
do our work for us.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.976
Why doesn't this make our labor redundant
and our skills obsolete?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.696
Why are there still so many jobs?

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.456
(Laughter)

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.816
I'm going to try to answer
that question tonight,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.576
and along the way, I'm going to tell you
what this means for the future of work

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.776
and the challenges that automation
does and does not pose

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.240
for our society.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.280
Why are there so many jobs?

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.056
There are actually two fundamental
economic principles at stake.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.776
One has to do with human genius

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.216
and creativity.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.096
The other has to do
with human insatiability,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.696
or greed, if you like.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.456
I'm going to call the first of these
the O-ring principle,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.656
and it determines
the type of work that we do.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.296
The second principle
is the never-get-enough principle,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.800
and it determines how many jobs
there actually are.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.776
Let's start with the O-ring.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.576
ATMs, automated teller machines,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.936
had two countervailing effects
on bank teller employment.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.656
As you would expect,
they replaced a lot of teller tasks.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.360
The number of tellers per branch
fell by about a third.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.056
But banks quickly discovered that it
also was cheaper to open new branches,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.216
and the number of bank branches
increased by about 40 percent

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.736
in the same time period.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.840
The net result was more branches
and more tellers.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.856
But those tellers were doing
somewhat different work.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.536
As their routine,
cash-handling tasks receded,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.696
they became less like checkout clerks

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.536
and more like salespeople,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.616
forging relationships with customers,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.856
solving problems

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.096
and introducing them to new products
like credit cards, loans and investments:

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.960
more tellers doing
a more cognitively demanding job.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.480
There's a general principle here.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.816
Most of the work that we do

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.320
requires a multiplicity of skills,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.336
and brains and brawn,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.976
technical expertise and intuitive mastery,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.960
perspiration and inspiration
in the words of Thomas Edison.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.736
In general, automating
some subset of those tasks

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.976
doesn't make the other ones unnecessary.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.960
In fact, it makes them more important.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.056
It increases their economic value.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.096
Let me give you a stark example.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.936
In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.256
exploded and crashed back down to Earth

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.200
less than two minutes after takeoff.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.816
The cause of that crash, it turned out,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.376
was an inexpensive rubber O-ring
in the booster rocket

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.256
that had frozen on the launchpad
the night before

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.656
and failed catastrophically
moments after takeoff.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.495
In this multibillion dollar enterprise

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.216
that simple rubber O-ring

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.815
made the difference
between mission success

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.680
and the calamitous death
of seven astronauts.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.336
An ingenious metaphor
for this tragic setting

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.576
is the O-ring production function,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.096
named by Harvard economist Michael Kremer

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.136
after the Challenger disaster.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.736
The O-ring production function
conceives of the work

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.096
as a series of interlocking steps,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.376
links in a chain.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.096
Every one of those links must hold
for the mission to succeed.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.256
If any of them fails,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.576
the mission, or the product
or the service,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.920
comes crashing down.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.496
This precarious situation
has a surprisingly positive implication,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.416
which is that improvements

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.416
in the reliability
of any one link in the chain

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.216
increases the value
of improving any of the other links.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.216
Concretely, if most of the links
are brittle and prone to breakage,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.696
the fact that your link
is not that reliable

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.976
is not that important.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Probably something else will break anyway.

00:05:30.024 --> 00:05:34.016
But as all the other links
become robust and reliable,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.536
the importance of your link
becomes more essential.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.880
In the limit, everything depends upon it.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.176
The reason the O-ring was critical
to space shuttle Challenger

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.920
is because everything else
worked perfectly.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.056
If the Challenger were
kind of the space era equivalent

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.616
of Microsoft Windows 2000 --

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.736
(Laughter)

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.216
the reliability of the O-ring
wouldn't have mattered

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.098
because the machine would have crashed.

00:05:59.122 --> 00:06:00.602
(Laughter)

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.536
Here's the broader point.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.376
In much of the work that we do,
we are the O-rings.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.936
Yes, ATMs could do
certain cash-handling tasks

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.976
faster and better than tellers,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.056
but that didn't make tellers superfluous.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.376
It increased the importance
of their problem-solving skills

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.016
and their relationships with customers.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.336
The same principle applies
if we're building a building,

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.896
if we're diagnosing
and caring for a patient,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.056
or if we are teaching a class

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.536
to a roomful of high schoolers.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.936
As our tools improve,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.056
technology magnifies our leverage

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.976
and increases the importance
of our expertise

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.200
and our judgment and our creativity.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.240
And that brings me
to the second principle:

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.360
never get enough.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.696
You may be thinking, OK, O-ring, got it,

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.816
that says the jobs that people do
will be important.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.816
They can't be done by machines,
but they still need to be done.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.736
But that doesn't tell me
how many jobs there will need to be.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.216
If you think about it,
isn't it kind of self-evident

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.776
that once we get sufficiently
productive at something,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.896
we've basically
worked our way out of a job?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.696
In 1900, 40 percent of all US employment

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.976
was on farms.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.256
Today, it's less than two percent.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.456
Why are there so few farmers today?

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.336
It's not because we're eating less.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.016
(Laughter)

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.776
A century of productivity
growth in farming

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.976
means that now,
a couple of million farmers

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.736
can feed a nation of 320 million.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.416
That's amazing progress,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.576
but it also means there are
only so many O-ring jobs left in farming.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.616
So clearly, technology can eliminate jobs.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.376
Farming is only one example.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.040
There are many others like it.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.416
But what's true about a single product
or service or industry

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.216
has never been true
about the economy as a whole.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.736
Many of the industries
in which we now work --

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.896
health and medicine,

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.136
finance and insurance,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.800
electronics and computing --

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.456
were tiny or barely existent
a century ago.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.296
Many of the products
that we spend a lot of our money on --

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.456
air conditioners, sport utility vehicles,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.176
computers and mobile devices --

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.856
were unattainably expensive,

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.320
or just hadn't been invented
a century ago.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.896
As automation frees our time,
increases the scope of what is possible,

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.136
we invent new products,
new ideas, new services

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.736
that command our attention,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.296
occupy our time

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.960
and spur consumption.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.976
You may think some
of these things are frivolous --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.776
extreme yoga, adventure tourism,

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.056
Pokémon GO --

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.400
and I might agree with you.

00:08:36.979 --> 00:08:40.456
But people desire these things,
and they're willing to work hard for them.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.656
The average worker in 2015

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.936
wanting to attain
the average living standard in 1915

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.296
could do so by working
just 17 weeks a year,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.760
one third of the time.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.416
But most people don't choose to do that.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.135
They are willing to work hard

00:08:56.159 --> 00:09:00.040
to harvest the technological bounty
that is available to them.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.576
Material abundance has never
eliminated perceived scarcity.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.176
In the words of economist
Thorstein Veblen,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.840
invention is the mother of necessity.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.720
Now ...

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.256
So if you accept these two principles,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.176
the O-ring principle
and the never-get-enough principle,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.536
then you agree with me.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.960
There will be jobs.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.736
Does that mean there's
nothing to worry about?

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.536
Automation, employment, robots and jobs --

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.480
it'll all take care of itself?

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.336
No.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.416
That is not my argument.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.976
Automation creates wealth

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.576
by allowing us to do
more work in less time.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.176
There is no economic law

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.976
that says that we
will use that wealth well,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.800
and that is worth worrying about.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.616
Consider two countries,

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.776
Norway and Saudi Arabia.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.376
Both oil-rich nations,

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.976
it's like they have money
spurting out of a hole in the ground.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.536
(Laughter)

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.776
But they haven't used that wealth
equally well to foster human prosperity,

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.000
human prospering.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.176
Norway is a thriving democracy.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.856
By and large, its citizens
work and play well together.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.896
It's typically numbered
between first and fourth

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.656
in rankings of national happiness.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.336
Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.976
in which many citizens
lack a path for personal advancement.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.496
It's typically ranked 35th
among nations in happiness,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.616
which is low for such a wealthy nation.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.976
Just by way of comparison,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.800
the US is typically ranked
around 12th or 13th.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.496
The difference between these two countries

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.776
is not their wealth

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.536
and it's not their technology.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.880
It's their institutions.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.736
Norway has invested to build a society

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.096
with opportunity and economic mobility.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.296
Saudi Arabia has raised living standards

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.576
while frustrating
many other human strivings.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.376
Two countries, both wealthy,

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.120
not equally well off.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.216
And this brings me
to the challenge that we face today,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.376
the challenge that
automation poses for us.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.856
The challenge is not
that we're running out of work.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.816
The US has added 14 million jobs

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.976
since the depths of the Great Recession.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.536
The challenge is that many of those jobs

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.856
are not good jobs,

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.976
and many citizens
cannot qualify for the good jobs

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.200
that are being created.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.336
Employment growth in the United States
and in much of the developed world

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.816
looks something like a barbell

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.216
with increasing poundage
on either end of the bar.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.456
On the one hand,

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.296
you have high-education, high-wage jobs

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.896
like doctors and nurses,
programmers and engineers,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.656
marketing and sales managers.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.696
Employment is robust in these jobs,
employment growth.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.736
Similarly, employment growth
is robust in many low-skill,

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.816
low-education jobs like food service,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.096
cleaning, security,

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.360
home health aids.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.176
Simultaneously, employment is shrinking

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.256
in many middle-education,
middle-wage, middle-class jobs,

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.096
like blue-collar production
and operative positions

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.096
and white-collar
clerical and sales positions.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.376
The reasons behind this contracting middle

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.616
are not mysterious.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.616
Many of those middle-skill jobs

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.136
use well-understood rules and procedures

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.256
that can increasingly
be codified in software

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.640
and executed by computers.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.576
The challenge that
this phenomenon creates,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.136
what economists call
employment polarization,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.776
is that it knocks out rungs
in the economic ladder,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.616
shrinks the size of the middle class

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.776
and threatens to make us
a more stratified society.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.856
On the one hand, a set of highly paid,
highly educated professionals

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.296
doing interesting work,

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.736
on the other, a large number
of citizens in low-paid jobs

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:46.416
whose primary responsibility is to see
to the comfort and health of the affluent.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.776
That is not my vision of progress,

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.680
and I doubt that it is yours.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.456
But here is some encouraging news.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.336
We have faced equally momentous
economic transformations in the past,

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.056
and we have come
through them successfully.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:06.016
In the late 1800s and early 1900s,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.576
when automation was eliminating
vast numbers of agricultural jobs --

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.936
remember that tractor? --

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.656
the farm states faced a threat
of mass unemployment,

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.496
a generation of youth
no longer needed on the farm

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.280
but not prepared for industry.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.656
Rising to this challenge,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.176
they took the radical step

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.016
of requiring that
their entire youth population

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.896
remain in school
and continue their education

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.040
to the ripe old age of 16.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.576
This was called the high school movement,

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.416
and it was a radically
expensive thing to do.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.696
Not only did they have
to invest in the schools,

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.416
but those kids couldn't work
at their jobs.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.736
It also turned out to be
one of the best investments

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.976
the US made in the 20th century.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.336
It gave us the most skilled,
the most flexible

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.056
and the most productive
workforce in the world.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.616
To see how well this worked,
imagine taking the labor force of 1899

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.856
and bringing them into the present.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.816
Despite their strong backs
and good characters,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.616
many of them would lack
the basic literacy and numeracy skills

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.576
to do all but the most mundane jobs.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.840
Many of them would be unemployable.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.576
What this example highlights
is the primacy of our institutions,

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.376
most especially our schools,

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.936
in allowing us to reap the harvest

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.256
of our technological prosperity.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.696
It's foolish to say
there's nothing to worry about.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.920
Clearly we can get this wrong.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.136
If the US had not invested
in its schools and in its skills

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.416
a century ago with
the high school movement,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.096
we would be a less prosperous,

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.736
a less mobile and probably
a lot less happy society.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.496
But it's equally foolish
to say that our fates are sealed.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.216
That's not decided by the machines.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.976
It's not even decided by the market.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.640
It's decided by us
and by our institutions.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.936
Now, I started this talk with a paradox.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.616
Our machines increasingly
do our work for us.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.896
Why doesn't that make
our labor superfluous,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.136
our skills redundant?

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.576
Isn't it obvious that the road
to our economic and social hell

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.800
is paved with our own great inventions?

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.216
History has repeatedly offered
an answer to that paradox.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.856
The first part of the answer
is that technology magnifies our leverage,

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.496
increases the importance, the added value

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.056
of our expertise,
our judgment and our creativity.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.280
That's the O-ring.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.616
The second part of the answer
is our endless inventiveness

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.096
and bottomless desires

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.456
means that we never get enough,
never get enough.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.640
There's always new work to do.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.296
Adjusting to the rapid pace
of technological change

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.776
creates real challenges,

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.776
seen most clearly
in our polarized labor market

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.320
and the threat that it poses
to economic mobility.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.760
Rising to this challenge is not automatic.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.896
It's not costless.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.336
It's not easy.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.560
But it is feasible.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.936
And here is some encouraging news.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.096
Because of our amazing productivity,

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.376
we're rich.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.536
Of course we can afford
to invest in ourselves and in our children

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.896
as America did a hundred years ago
with the high school movement.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.200
Arguably, we can't afford not to.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.896
Now, you may be thinking,

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.776
Professor Autor has told us
a heartwarming tale

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.576
about the distant past,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.976
the recent past,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.296
maybe the present,
but probably not the future.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.256
Because everybody knows
that this time is different.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.096
Right? Is this time different?

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.016
Of course this time is different.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.736
Every time is different.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.376
On numerous occasions
in the last 200 years,

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.176
scholars and activists
have raised the alarm

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.736
that we are running out of work
and making ourselves obsolete:

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.376
for example, the Luddites
in the early 1800s;

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.336
US Secretary of Labor James Davis

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.776
in the mid-1920s;

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.976
Nobel Prize-winning economist
Wassily Leontief in 1982;

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.256
and of course, many scholars,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.416
pundits, technologists

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.280
and media figures today.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.920
These predictions strike me as arrogant.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.496
These self-proclaimed oracles
are in effect saying,

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.936
"If I can't think of what people
will do for work in the future,

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.856
then you, me and our kids

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.595
aren't going to think of it either."

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.695
I don't have the guts

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.896
to take that bet against human ingenuity.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.896
Look, I can't tell you
what people are going to do for work

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.816
a hundred years from now.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.440
But the future doesn't hinge
on my imagination.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.056
If I were a farmer in Iowa
in the year 1900,

00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:38.616
and an economist from the 21st century
teleported down to my field

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.160
and said, "Hey, guess what, farmer Autor,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.536
in the next hundred years,

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.336
agricultural employment is going to fall
from 40 percent of all jobs

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.576
to two percent

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.600
purely due to rising productivity.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.560
What do you think the other
38 percent of workers are going to do?"

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.216
I would not have said, "Oh, we got this.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.096
We'll do app development,
radiological medicine,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.096
yoga instruction, Bitmoji."

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.656
(Laughter)

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.966
I wouldn't have had a clue.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.336
But I hope I would have had
the wisdom to say,

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.376
"Wow, a 95 percent reduction
in farm employment

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.536
with no shortage of food.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.976
That's an amazing amount of progress.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.376
I hope that humanity
finds something remarkable to do

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.280
with all of that prosperity."

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.200
And by and large, I would say that it has.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.216
Thank you very much.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.295
(Applause)
