00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.272
Now, extinction is a different kind of death.

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:23.895
It's bigger.

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:26.975
We didn't really realize that until 1914,

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:30.190
when the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.208
died at the Cincinnati zoo.

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:36.749
This had been the most abundant bird in the world

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:40.356
that'd been in North America for six million years.

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:43.661
Suddenly it wasn't here at all.

00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:47.738
Flocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles long

00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:50.385
used to darken the sun.

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:53.455
Aldo Leopold said this was a biological storm,

00:00:53.455 --> 00:00:56.260
a feathered tempest.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.704
And indeed it was a keystone species

00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:02.720
that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.004
from the Mississippi to the Atlantic,

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:08.319
from Canada down to the Gulf.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:11.632
But it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades.

00:01:11.632 --> 00:01:12.832
What happened?

00:01:12.832 --> 00:01:14.985
Well, commercial hunting happened.

00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:18.944
These birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton,

00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:21.264
and it was easy to do because when those big flocks

00:01:21.264 --> 00:01:23.536
came down to the ground, they were so dense

00:01:23.536 --> 00:01:25.904
that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up

00:01:25.904 --> 00:01:28.910
and slaughter them by the tens of thousands.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.928
It was the cheapest source of protein in America.

00:01:31.928 --> 00:01:33.903
By the end of the century, there was nothing left

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:38.743
but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers.

00:01:38.743 --> 00:01:40.618
There's an upside to the story.

00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:42.532
This made people realize that the same thing

00:01:42.532 --> 00:01:45.024
was about to happen to the American bison,

00:01:45.024 --> 00:01:48.429
and so these birds saved the buffalos.

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.103
But a lot of other animals weren't saved.

00:01:50.103 --> 00:01:54.894
The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere.

00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:57.240
It was hunted to death for its feathers.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.342
There was a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen.

00:02:00.342 --> 00:02:03.351
It was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway.

00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:06.725
A local newspaper spelled out, "There is no survivor,

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:11.542
there is no future, there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again."

00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:14.213
There's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things,

00:02:14.213 --> 00:02:16.638
and it happened to lots of birds that people loved.

00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:18.846
It happened to lots of mammals.

00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:21.469
Another keystone species is a famous animal

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.534
called the European aurochs.

00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:25.989
There was sort of a movie made about it recently.

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.597
And the aurochs was like the bison.

00:02:28.597 --> 00:02:31.777
This was an animal that basically kept the forest

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:36.829
mixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent,

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.173
from Spain to Korea.

00:02:39.173 --> 00:02:41.301
The documentation of this animal goes back

00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:44.526
to the Lascaux cave paintings.

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:46.718
The extinctions still go on.

00:02:46.718 --> 00:02:49.747
There's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo.

00:02:49.747 --> 00:02:52.093
It went extinct in 2000.

00:02:52.093 --> 00:02:54.850
There was a marvelous animal, a marsupial wolf

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.581
called the thylacine in Tasmania, south of Australia,

00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:00.651
called the Tasmanian tiger.

00:03:00.651 --> 00:03:04.969
It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos.

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.005
A little bit of film was shot.

00:03:18.853 --> 00:03:24.110
Sorrow, anger, mourning.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.266
Don't mourn. Organize.

00:03:27.266 --> 00:03:30.885
What if you could find out that, using the DNA in museum specimens,

00:03:30.885 --> 00:03:33.882
fossils maybe up to 200,000 years old

00:03:33.882 --> 00:03:36.320
could be used to bring species back,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.944
what would you do? Where would you start?

00:03:37.944 --> 00:03:40.858
Well, you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there.

00:03:40.858 --> 00:03:42.950
I started with my wife, Ryan Phelan,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.084
who ran a biotech business called DNA Direct,

00:03:46.084 --> 00:03:50.133
and through her, one of her colleagues, George Church,

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:52.828
one of the leading genetic engineers

00:03:52.828 --> 00:03:55.837
who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons

00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:57.448
and a lot of confidence

00:03:57.448 --> 00:03:59.760
that methodologies he was working on

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.849
might actually do the deed.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.104
So he and Ryan organized and hosted a meeting

00:04:05.104 --> 00:04:07.368
at the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing together

00:04:07.368 --> 00:04:11.979
specialists on passenger pigeons, conservation ornithologists, bioethicists,

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:16.092
and fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced

00:04:16.092 --> 00:04:19.383
by a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro.

00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:22.262
All she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonian

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.917
was a little bit of toe pad tissue,

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:28.300
because down in there is what is called ancient DNA.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.272
It's DNA which is pretty badly fragmented,

00:04:31.272 --> 00:04:36.164
but with good techniques now, you can basically reassemble the whole genome.

00:04:36.164 --> 00:04:38.485
Then the question is, can you reassemble,

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:40.980
with that genome, the whole bird?

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.484
George Church thinks you can.

00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:46.549
So in his book, "Regenesis," which I recommend,

00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:50.012
he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species,

00:04:50.012 --> 00:04:51.548
and he has a machine called

00:04:51.548 --> 00:04:54.996
the Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering machine.

00:04:54.996 --> 00:04:56.730
It's kind of like an evolution machine.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.436
You try combinations of genes that you write

00:04:59.436 --> 00:05:02.676
at the cell level and then in organs on a chip,

00:05:02.676 --> 00:05:04.585
and the ones that win, that you can then put

00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:07.282
into a living organism. It'll work.

00:05:07.282 --> 00:05:10.476
The precision of this, one of George's famous unreadable slides,

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:15.075
nevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here

00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:17.641
right down to the individual base pair.

00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:21.780
The passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.785
So what you're getting is the capability now

00:05:24.785 --> 00:05:28.310
of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.213
It's called an allele.

00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:33.063
Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway.

00:05:33.063 --> 00:05:36.254
So this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome

00:05:36.254 --> 00:05:38.134
of an extinct species

00:05:38.134 --> 00:05:41.664
with the genome of its closest living relative.

00:05:41.664 --> 00:05:44.379
Now along the way, George points out that

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:48.190
his technology, the technology of synthetic biology,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.996
is currently accelerating at four times the rate of Moore's Law.

00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:56.284
It's been doing that since 2005, and it's likely to continue.

00:05:56.284 --> 00:05:58.988
Okay, the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon

00:05:58.988 --> 00:06:02.282
is the band-tailed pigeon. They're abundant. There's some around here.

00:06:02.282 --> 00:06:06.370
Genetically, the band-tailed pigeon already is

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.738
mostly living passenger pigeon.

00:06:08.738 --> 00:06:11.173
There's just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon.

00:06:11.173 --> 00:06:13.917
If you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits,

00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:18.132
you've got the extinct bird back, cooing at you.

00:06:18.132 --> 00:06:20.040
Now, there's work to do.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.754
You have to figure out exactly what genes matter.

00:06:22.754 --> 00:06:25.396
So there's genes for the short tail in the band-tailed pigeon,

00:06:25.396 --> 00:06:28.096
genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon,

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:31.654
and so on with the red eye, peach-colored breast, flocking, and so on.

00:06:31.654 --> 00:06:34.525
Add them all up and the result won't be perfect.

00:06:34.525 --> 00:06:36.503
But it should be be perfect enough,

00:06:36.503 --> 00:06:39.149
because nature doesn't do perfect either.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:43.325
So this meeting in Boston led to three things.

00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:46.871
First off, Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofit

00:06:46.871 --> 00:06:50.524
called Revive and Restore that would push de-extinction generally

00:06:50.524 --> 00:06:53.675
and try to have it go in a responsible way,

00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:56.963
and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon.

00:06:56.963 --> 00:07:01.028
Another direct result was a young grad student named Ben Novak,

00:07:01.028 --> 00:07:04.284
who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was 14

00:07:04.284 --> 00:07:07.347
and had also learned how to work with ancient DNA,

00:07:07.347 --> 00:07:10.658
himself sequenced the passenger pigeon,

00:07:10.658 --> 00:07:13.273
using money from his family and friends.

00:07:13.273 --> 00:07:15.420
We hired him full-time.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.084
Now, this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian,

00:07:19.084 --> 00:07:21.315
he's looking down at Martha,

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:24.100
the last passenger pigeon alive.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.835
So if he's successful, she won't be the last.

00:07:26.835 --> 00:07:29.717
The third result of the Boston meeting was the realization

00:07:29.717 --> 00:07:31.550
that there are scientists all over the world

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.524
working on various forms of de-extinction,

00:07:33.524 --> 00:07:35.339
but they'd never met each other.

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:37.323
And National Geographic got interested

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:39.806
because National Geographic has the theory that

00:07:39.806 --> 00:07:43.179
the last century, discovery was basically finding things,

00:07:43.179 --> 00:07:47.256
and in this century, discovery is basically making things.

00:07:47.256 --> 00:07:49.080
De-extinction falls in that category.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.914
So they hosted and funded this meeting. And 35 scientists,

00:07:52.914 --> 00:07:56.194
they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists,

00:07:56.194 --> 00:07:59.610
basically meeting to see if they had work to do together.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.976
Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical.

00:08:01.976 --> 00:08:05.538
There's three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species,

00:08:05.538 --> 00:08:08.659
they're recreating extinct ecosystems

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:12.527
in northern Siberia, in the Netherlands, and in Hawaii.

00:08:12.527 --> 00:08:14.802
Henri, from the Netherlands,

00:08:14.802 --> 00:08:17.493
with a Dutch last name I won't try to pronounce,

00:08:17.493 --> 00:08:19.738
is working on the aurochs.

00:08:19.738 --> 00:08:24.091
The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle,

00:08:24.091 --> 00:08:29.665
and so basically its genome is alive, it's just unevenly distributed.

00:08:29.665 --> 00:08:32.079
So what they're doing is working with seven breeds

00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:36.834
of primitive, hardy-looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there

00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:40.299
to rebuild, over time, with selective back-breeding,

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.362
the aurochs.

00:08:42.362 --> 00:08:45.395
Now, re-wilding is moving faster in Korea

00:08:45.395 --> 00:08:47.254
than it is in America,

00:08:47.254 --> 00:08:50.914
and so the plan is, with these re-wilded areas all over Europe,

00:08:50.914 --> 00:08:54.122
they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job,

00:08:54.122 --> 00:08:56.064
its old ecological role,

00:08:56.064 --> 00:08:59.323
of clearing the somewhat barren, closed-canopy forest

00:08:59.323 --> 00:09:03.134
so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it.

00:09:03.134 --> 00:09:04.949
Another amazing story

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:08.347
came from Alberto Fernández-Arias.

00:09:08.347 --> 00:09:11.666
Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain.

00:09:11.666 --> 00:09:14.499
The last bucardo was a female named Celia

00:09:14.499 --> 00:09:19.062
who was still alive, but then they captured her,

00:09:19.062 --> 00:09:21.474
they got a little bit of tissue from her ear,

00:09:21.474 --> 00:09:24.658
they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen,

00:09:24.658 --> 00:09:26.444
released her back into the wild,

00:09:26.444 --> 00:09:30.194
but a few months later, she was found dead under a fallen tree.

00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:32.802
They took the DNA from that ear,

00:09:32.802 --> 00:09:36.242
they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat,

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.316
the pregnancy came to term,

00:09:38.316 --> 00:09:40.531
and a live baby bucardo was born.

00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:43.379
It was the first de-extinction in history.

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:46.922
(Applause)

00:09:46.922 --> 00:09:48.149
It was short-lived.

00:09:48.149 --> 00:09:51.787
Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems.

00:09:51.787 --> 00:09:54.828
This one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes,

00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:57.908
but Alberto was confident that

00:09:57.908 --> 00:10:00.308
cloning has moved along well since then,

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:01.847
and this will move ahead, and eventually

00:10:01.847 --> 00:10:03.854
there will be a population of bucardos

00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:07.111
back in the mountains in northern Spain.

00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:10.937
Cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder.

00:10:10.937 --> 00:10:13.324
At the San Diego zoo, his frozen zoo

00:10:13.324 --> 00:10:17.275
has collected the tissues from over 1,000 species

00:10:17.275 --> 00:10:20.253
over the last 35 years.

00:10:20.253 --> 00:10:22.284
Now, when it's frozen that deep,

00:10:22.284 --> 00:10:25.004
minus 196 degrees Celsius,

00:10:25.004 --> 00:10:27.636
the cells are intact and the DNA is intact.

00:10:27.636 --> 00:10:29.713
They're basically viable cells,

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:33.341
so someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technology

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.556
took some of that tissue from an endangered animal

00:10:36.556 --> 00:10:38.750
called the Javan banteng, put it in a cow,

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.800
the cow went to term, and what was born

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.881
was a live, healthy baby Javan banteng,

00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:50.284
who thrived and is still alive.

00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:53.060
The most exciting thing for Bob Lanza

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.748
is the ability now to take any kind of cell

00:10:55.748 --> 00:10:58.196
with induced pluripotent stem cells

00:10:58.196 --> 00:11:02.169
and turn it into germ cells, like sperm and eggs.

00:11:02.169 --> 00:11:04.452
So now we go to Mike McGrew

00:11:04.452 --> 00:11:07.948
who is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland,

00:11:07.948 --> 00:11:10.252
and Mike's doing miracles with birds.

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:13.772
So he'll take, say, falcon skin cells, fibroblast,

00:11:13.772 --> 00:11:16.560
turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.990
Since it's so pluripotent, it can become germ plasm.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.246
He then has a way to put the germ plasm

00:11:22.246 --> 00:11:25.790
into the embryo of a chicken egg

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.061
so that that chicken will have, basically,

00:11:29.061 --> 00:11:30.902
the gonads of a falcon.

00:11:30.902 --> 00:11:32.816
You get a male and a female each of those,

00:11:32.816 --> 00:11:35.757
and out of them comes falcons.

00:11:35.757 --> 00:11:37.716
(Laughter)

00:11:37.716 --> 00:11:42.841
Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens.

00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:45.318
Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting.

00:11:45.318 --> 00:11:47.747
He showed how all of this can be put together.

00:11:47.747 --> 00:11:50.293
The sequence of events: he'll put together the genomes

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.671
of the band-tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon,

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:55.621
he'll take the techniques of George Church

00:11:55.621 --> 00:11:57.902
and get passenger pigeon DNA,

00:11:57.902 --> 00:12:00.587
the techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew,

00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:02.846
get that DNA into chicken gonads,

00:12:02.846 --> 00:12:07.065
and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs, squabs,

00:12:07.065 --> 00:12:10.551
and now you're getting a population of passenger pigeons.

00:12:10.551 --> 00:12:12.495
It does raise the question of,

00:12:12.495 --> 00:12:14.468
they're not going to have passenger pigeon parents

00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:17.094
to teach them how to be a passenger pigeon.

00:12:17.094 --> 00:12:19.350
So what do you do about that?

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.023
Well birds are pretty hard-wired, as it happens,

00:12:22.023 --> 00:12:24.390
so most of that is already in their DNA,

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.174
but to supplement it, part of Ben's idea

00:12:27.174 --> 00:12:28.830
is to use homing pigeons

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.000
to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.734
and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds

00:12:34.734 --> 00:12:37.883
and feeding grounds.

00:12:37.883 --> 00:12:39.521
There were some conservationists,

00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:42.597
really famous conservationists like Stanley Temple,

00:12:42.597 --> 00:12:45.213
who is one of the founders of conservation biology,

00:12:45.213 --> 00:12:49.869
and Kate Jones from the IUCN, which does the Red List.

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:51.830
They're excited about all this,

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.333
but they're also concerned that it might be competitive

00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:57.371
with the extremely important efforts to protect

00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:59.581
endangered species that are still alive,

00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:01.427
that haven't gone extinct yet.

00:13:01.427 --> 00:13:03.800
You see, you want to work on protecting the animals out there.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.029
You want to work on getting the market for ivory in Asia down

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:11.907
so you're not using 25,000 elephants a year.

00:13:11.907 --> 00:13:14.957
But at the same time, conservation biologists are realizing

00:13:14.957 --> 00:13:17.541
that bad news bums people out.

00:13:17.541 --> 00:13:20.266
And so the Red List is really important, keep track of

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:23.590
what's endangered and critically endangered, and so on.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.615
But they're about to create what they call a Green List,

00:13:26.615 --> 00:13:30.997
and the Green List will have species that are doing fine, thank you,

00:13:30.997 --> 00:13:33.301
species that were endangered, like the bald eagle,

00:13:33.301 --> 00:13:36.916
but they're much better off now, thanks to everybody's good work,

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:39.082
and protected areas around the world

00:13:39.082 --> 00:13:40.843
that are very, very well managed.

00:13:40.843 --> 00:13:44.946
So basically, they're learning how to build on good news.

00:13:44.946 --> 00:13:48.057
And they see reviving extinct species

00:13:48.057 --> 00:13:50.937
as the kind of good news you might be able to build on.

00:13:50.937 --> 00:13:54.262
Here's a couple related examples.

00:13:54.262 --> 00:13:57.473
Captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species.

00:13:57.473 --> 00:14:00.889
The California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987.

00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:02.598
Everybody thought is was finished.

00:14:02.598 --> 00:14:05.418
Thanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo,

00:14:05.418 --> 00:14:09.438
there's 405 of them now, 226 are out in the wild.

00:14:09.438 --> 00:14:13.647
That technology will be used on de-extincted animals.

00:14:13.647 --> 00:14:17.114
Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa.

00:14:17.114 --> 00:14:20.497
In 1981, Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct.

00:14:20.497 --> 00:14:22.530
There were just 254 left.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.069
Now there are 880. They're increasing in population

00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:28.162
by three percent a year.

00:14:28.162 --> 00:14:31.553
The secret is, they have an eco-tourism program,

00:14:31.553 --> 00:14:33.222
which is absolutely brilliant.

00:14:33.222 --> 00:14:35.857
So this photograph was taken last month by Ryan

00:14:35.857 --> 00:14:38.633
with an iPhone.

00:14:38.633 --> 00:14:42.948
That's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors.

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:46.683
Another interesting project, though it's going to need some help,

00:14:46.683 --> 00:14:48.594
is the northern white rhinoceros.

00:14:48.594 --> 00:14:50.555
There's no breeding pairs left.

00:14:50.555 --> 00:14:52.725
But this is the kind of thing that

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:56.865
a wide variety of DNA for this animal is available in the frozen zoo.

00:14:56.865 --> 00:14:59.660
A bit of cloning, you can get them back.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.850
So where do we go from here?

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.514
These have been private meetings so far.

00:15:03.514 --> 00:15:06.171
I think it's time for the subject to go public.

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:07.638
What do people think about it?

00:15:07.638 --> 00:15:09.717
You know, do you want extinct species back?

00:15:09.717 --> 00:15:12.569
Do you want extinct species back?

00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:17.835
(Applause)

00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:20.331
Tinker Bell is going to come fluttering down.

00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:21.545
It is a Tinker Bell moment,

00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:23.941
because what are people excited about with this?

00:15:23.941 --> 00:15:25.992
What are they concerned about?

00:15:25.992 --> 00:15:28.439
We're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon.

00:15:28.439 --> 00:15:32.209
So Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the group

00:15:32.209 --> 00:15:35.530
that Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.918
They're going to work on the genomes

00:15:36.918 --> 00:15:39.205
of the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon.

00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:43.114
As that data matures, they'll send it to George Church,

00:15:43.114 --> 00:15:47.009
who will work his magic, get passenger pigeon DNA out of that.

00:15:47.009 --> 00:15:49.853
We'll get help from Bob Lanza and Mike McGrew

00:15:49.853 --> 00:15:52.920
to get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.488
that can produce passenger pigeon squabs

00:15:55.488 --> 00:15:57.952
that can be raised by band-tailed pigeon parents,

00:15:57.952 --> 00:16:00.208
and then from then on, it's passenger pigeons all the way,

00:16:00.208 --> 00:16:03.344
maybe for the next six million years.

00:16:03.344 --> 00:16:05.659
You can do the same thing, as the costs come down,

00:16:05.659 --> 00:16:08.881
for the Carolina parakeet, for the great auk,

00:16:08.881 --> 00:16:11.676
for the heath hen, for the ivory-billed woodpecker,

00:16:11.676 --> 00:16:13.782
for the Eskimo curlew, for the Caribbean monk seal,

00:16:13.782 --> 00:16:16.648
for the woolly mammoth.

00:16:16.648 --> 00:16:19.124
Because the fact is, humans have made a huge hole

00:16:19.124 --> 00:16:22.214
in nature in the last 10,000 years.

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:24.253
We have the ability now,

00:16:24.253 --> 00:16:29.117
and maybe the moral obligation, to repair some of the damage.

00:16:29.117 --> 00:16:33.665
Most of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands,

00:16:33.665 --> 00:16:35.334
by expanding and protecting

00:16:35.334 --> 00:16:39.861
the populations of endangered species.

00:16:39.861 --> 00:16:42.016
But some species

00:16:42.016 --> 00:16:47.199
that we killed off totally

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:50.513
we could consider bringing back

00:16:50.513 --> 00:16:53.680
to a world that misses them.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.890
Thank you.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:07.088
(Applause)

00:17:07.088 --> 00:17:08.942
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

00:17:08.942 --> 00:17:10.754
I've got a question.

00:17:10.754 --> 00:17:15.504
So, this is an emotional topic. Some people stand.

00:17:15.504 --> 00:17:18.360
I suspect there are some people out there sitting,

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.369
kind of asking tormented questions, almost, about,

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.279
well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute,

00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:26.376
there's something wrong with mankind

00:17:26.376 --> 00:17:29.856
interfering in nature in this way.

00:17:29.856 --> 00:17:33.328
There's going to be unintended consequences.

00:17:33.328 --> 00:17:36.105
You're going to uncork some sort of Pandora's box

00:17:36.105 --> 00:17:40.091
of who-knows-what. Do they have a point?

00:17:40.091 --> 00:17:41.591
Stewart Brand: Well, the earlier point is

00:17:41.591 --> 00:17:45.142
we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct,

00:17:45.142 --> 00:17:47.683
and many of them were keystone species,

00:17:47.683 --> 00:17:50.192
and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in

00:17:50.192 --> 00:17:51.985
by letting them go.

00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:54.566
Now, there's the shifting baseline problem, which is,

00:17:54.566 --> 00:17:56.104
so when these things come back,

00:17:56.104 --> 00:17:58.395
they might replace some birds that are there

00:17:58.395 --> 00:18:00.789
that people really know and love.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:03.536
I think that's, you know, part of how it'll work.

00:18:03.536 --> 00:18:06.421
This is a long, slow process --

00:18:06.421 --> 00:18:08.655
One of the things I like about it, it's multi-generation.

00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:10.712
We will get woolly mammoths back.

00:18:10.712 --> 00:18:12.488
CA: Well it feels like both the conversation

00:18:12.488 --> 00:18:14.776
and the potential here are pretty thrilling.

00:18:14.776 --> 00:18:16.490
Thank you so much for presenting. SB: Thank you.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.213
CA: Thank you. (Applause)
