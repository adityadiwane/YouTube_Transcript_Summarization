00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.160
no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson --

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
by what we put into it or by what we took out of it.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.160
but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
I want to share with you

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost --

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
actually, we've taken, we've eaten --

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea;

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared;

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.160
why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
should concern not only the creatures that are dying,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
but it really should concern you.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
It does concern you, as well.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.160
I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child,"

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
asking why we didn't do something on our watch

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160
to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
while there still was time.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
Well, now is that time.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
I hope for your help

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
to explore and protect the wild ocean

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
in ways that will restore the health and,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.160
in so doing, secure hope for humankind.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
Health to the ocean means health for us.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.160
And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
and other sea creatures

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
And I hope, Jill, that someday

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.160
we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
(Laughter)

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
Did I say that? I guess I did.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
For me, as a scientist,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
it all began in 1953

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
when I first tried scuba.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
It's when I first got to know fish swimming

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
in something other than lemon slices and butter.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
I actually love diving at night;

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.160
Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.160
when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time --

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.160
at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.160
In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
while using this personal submersible called Jim.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
It's one of my favorite bathing suits.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.160
Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
to design and build systems

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
to access the deep sea.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
I led a five-year National Geographic expedition,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
the Sustainable Seas expeditions,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
using these little subs.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
And I'm living proof.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
Astronauts and aquanauts alike

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.160
really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature --

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.160
all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
and then do everything he could

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160
to take care of his life support system;

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.160
and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system."

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
We need to learn everything we can about it

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
and do everything we can to take care of it.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.160
The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love;

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
none without water."

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
No blue, no green.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
If you think the ocean isn't important,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
imagine Earth without it.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
Mars comes to mind.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
No ocean, no life support system.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
and I showed this amazing image of Earth

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!"

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.160
That's where all the assets are!

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.160
And we've been trawling them down

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
much faster than the natural systems can replenish them.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
With every drop of water you drink,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
every breath you take,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
you're connected to the sea.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
No matter where on Earth you live.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
has been absorbed and stored there,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
mostly by microbes.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
The ocean drives climate and weather,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
Water from the sea forms clouds

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
that return to the land and the seas

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
as rain, sleet and snow,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.160
and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
maybe in the universe.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
No water, no life;

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
no blue, no green.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
Yet we have this idea, we humans,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies --

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
are so vast and so resilient

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160
it doesn't matter what we do to it.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
That may have been true 10,000 years ago,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
and maybe even 1,000 years ago

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
but in the last 100, especially in the last 50,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
we've drawn down the assets,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.160
the air, the water, the wildlife

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.160
that make our lives possible.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
New technologies are helping us to understand

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
the nature of nature;

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
the nature of what's happening,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
showing us our impact on the Earth.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
And fortunately, in our time,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
And with knowing comes caring.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
And with caring, there's hope

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
that we can find an enduring place for ourselves

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
within the natural systems that support us.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
But first we have to know.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
Three years ago, I met John Hanke,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
who's the head of Google Earth,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.160
and go exploring vicariously.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it?

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160
You did a great job with the land, the dirt.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160
What about the water?"

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.160
Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
with DOER Marine, with National Geographic,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.160
with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
ones that we could enlist,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160
to put the ocean in Google Earth.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
And as of just this week, last Monday,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
Google Earth is now whole.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
we can find the nearby aquarium,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
we can look at where we're sitting,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
and California's four national marine sanctuaries,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
and the new network of state marine reserves

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.160
that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
We can flit over to Hawaii

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
and see the real Hawaiian Islands:

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160
not just the little bit that pokes through the surface,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
but also what's below.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! --

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
right there, ha --

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
under the ocean, see what the whales see.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.160
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.160
We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.160
and visit with humpback whales.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.160
These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
many times underwater.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.160
We can pick up and fly to the deepest place:

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
seven miles down, the Mariana Trench,

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
where only two people have ever been.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
Imagine that. It's only seven miles,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
but only two people have been there, 49 years ago.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
One-way trips are easy.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
We need new deep-diving submarines.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.160
We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
and understand life in the deep sea.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.160
We can now go to the Arctic.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.160
Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.160
An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.160
That's bad news for the polar bears.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
That's bad news for us too.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.160
Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
it's also changing ocean chemistry,

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
making the sea more acidic.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
Also it's bad news for us.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
and other trash into the sea.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.160
Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.160
gear that continues to kill.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.160
We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
all carbon-based units.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.160
Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
the oxygen cycle, the water cycle --

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
our life support system.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.160
We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
and much more valuable alive than dead.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.160
All of these parts are part of our life support system.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:33.160
We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
that may stretch for 50 miles or more.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.160
Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
like bulldozers, taking everything in their path.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.160
Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers --

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.160
in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico --

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.160
shaking the foundation of our life support system,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
leaving plumes of death in their path.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.160
The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean --

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
think of the real cost.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
For every pound that goes to market,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.160
more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.160
may be thrown away as bycatch.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.160
This is the consequence of not knowing

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
from 1900 to 2000.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160
The highest concentrations are in red.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160
In my lifetime, imagine,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.160
90 percent of the big fish have been killed.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
are way down in numbers.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
But, there is good news.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
Ten percent of the big fish still remain.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160
There are still some blue whales.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
There are still some krill in Antarctica.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.160
a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
There's still time, but not a lot,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
to turn things around.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
But business as usual means that in 50 years,

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.160
there may be no coral reefs --

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.160
and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.160
Imagine the ocean without fish.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.160
Imagine what that means to our life support system.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.160
Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
but the problems are more obvious,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:34.160
and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.160
And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
the United States began establishing a system of parks

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.160
that some say was the best idea America ever had.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.160
About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected:

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.160
safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
generating oxygen, protecting watersheds.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:01.160
And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
National Marine Sanctuaries.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
That's another great idea.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
The good news is

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.160
that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
that have some kind of protection.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160
And you can find them on Google Earth.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
The bad news is

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
that you have to look hard to find them.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160
In the last three years, for example,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:27.160
the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.160
to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
Protected areas do rebound,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
but it takes a long time to restore

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.160
50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.160
or 200-year-old orange roughy.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.160
We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
Protected areas provide hope

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.160
of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.160
will live not just as a list,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.160
a photograph, or a paragraph.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160
that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever --

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
to search out hope spots,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.160
and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
Such as the Arctic --

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.160
we have one chance, right now, to get it right.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.160
Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:35.160
but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:40.160
Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.160
is being gathered up to feed cows.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.160
97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.160
but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160
It's true too in Argentina

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.160
The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel --

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.160
filled with luminous creatures,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
living in dark waters that average two miles deep.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
They flash, and sparkle, and glow

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.160
with their own living light.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.160
The next 10 years may be the most important,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.160
and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:33.160
to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.160
To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:42.160
We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.160
We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.160
But, nothing else will matter

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
if we fail to protect the ocean.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.160
Our fate and the ocean's are one.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.160
We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
A global plan of action

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
with a world conservation union, the IUCN,

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
is underway to protect biodiversity,

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.160
to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.160
on the high seas and in coastal areas,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.160
wherever we can identify critical places.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.160
New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.160
the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160
The goal is to protect biodiversity,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160
to provide stability and resilience.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160
We need deep-diving subs,

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.160
new technologies to explore the ocean.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.160
We need, maybe, an expedition --

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160
a TED at sea --

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.160
that could help figure out the next steps.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.160
And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.160
I wish you would use all means at your disposal --

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.160
films, expeditions, the web, new submarines --

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
and campaign to ignite public support

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.160
for a global network of marine protected areas --

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.160
hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.160
the blue heart of the planet.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.160
How much?

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.160
Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.160
You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
Whatever it is,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160
a fraction of one percent is not enough.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160
My wish is a big wish,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.160
but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.160
and help ensure the survival

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:41.160
of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species;

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.160
that would be us.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.160
For the children of today,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.160
for tomorrow's child:

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.160
as never again, now is the time.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.160
Thank you.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:18:08.160
(Applause)
