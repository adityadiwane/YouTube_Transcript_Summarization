00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:15.474
I want to speak about 
a forgotten conflict.

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:19.180
It's a conflict that rarely
hits the headlines.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.400
It happens right here,
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:00:24.244 --> 00:00:28.842
Now, most people outside of Africa
don't know much about the war in Congo,

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:32.099
so let me give you a couple of key facts.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.687
The Congolese conflict is the deadliest 
conflict since World War II.

00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:40.987
It has caused almost four million deaths.

00:00:40.987 --> 00:00:45.581
It has destabilized most of Central Africa
for the past 18 years.

00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:50.501
It is the largest ongoing
humanitarian crisis in the world.

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:54.162
That's why I first went to Congo in 2001.

00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:59.294
I was a young humanitarian aid worker,
and I met this woman who was my age.

00:00:59.294 --> 00:01:01.768
She was called Isabelle.

00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:06.179
Local militias
had attacked Isabelle's village.

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:09.227
They had killed many men,
raped many women.

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:11.224
They had looted everything.

00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:13.847
And then they wanted to take Isabelle,

00:01:13.847 --> 00:01:15.224
but her husband stepped in,

00:01:15.224 --> 00:01:18.422
and he said, "No,
please don't take Isabelle.

00:01:18.422 --> 00:01:21.709
Take me instead."

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:24.700
So he had gone to the forest
with the militias,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.871
and Isabelle had never seen him again.

00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:32.841
Well, it's because of people
like Isabelle and her husband

00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:35.860
that I have devoted my career
to studying this war

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.638
that we know so little about.

00:01:38.638 --> 00:01:43.262
Although there is one story
about Congo that you may have heard.

00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:47.214
It's a story about minerals and rape.

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:49.800
Policy statements and media reports

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.534
both usually focus on a primary cause
of violence in Congo --

00:01:54.534 --> 00:01:59.312
the illegal exploitation and trafficking
of natural resources --

00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:02.049
and on a main consequence --

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.243
sexual abuse of women and girls
as a weapon of war.

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:13.220
So, not that these two issues
aren't important and tragic. They are.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.978
But today I want to tell you 
a different story.

00:02:17.978 --> 00:02:21.596
I want to tell you a story
that emphasizes a core cause

00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:24.283
of the ongoing conflict.

00:02:24.283 --> 00:02:31.400
Violence in Congo is in large part driven
by local bottom-up conflicts

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.345
that international peace efforts
have failed to help address.

00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:42.568
The story starts from the fact
that not only is Congo notable

00:02:42.568 --> 00:02:46.885
for being the world's worst
ongoing humanitarian crisis,

00:02:46.885 --> 00:02:50.411
but it is also home to some of the largest

00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:54.572
international peacebuilding
efforts in the world.

00:02:54.572 --> 00:02:56.685
Congo hosts the largest

00:02:56.685 --> 00:03:01.530
and most expensive United Nations
peacekeeping mission in the world.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.229
It was also the site of the first
European-led peacekeeping mission,

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.903
and for its first cases ever,

00:03:08.903 --> 00:03:15.535
the International Criminal Court
chose to prosecute Congolese warlords.

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:22.035
In 2006, when Congo held the first 
free national elections in its history,

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:28.171
many observers thought that an end to 
violence in the region had finally come.

00:03:28.171 --> 00:03:34.300
The international community lauded the 
successful organization of these elections

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.637
as finally an example
of successful international intervention

00:03:38.637 --> 00:03:41.095
in a failed state.

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:42.853
But the eastern provinces

00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:46.260
have continued to face
massive population displacements

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.833
and horrific human rights violations.

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:52.318
Shortly before I went
back there last summer,

00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:57.209
there was a horrible massacre
in the province of South Kivu.

00:03:57.217 --> 00:03:59.245
Thirty-three people were killed.

00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:01.977
They were mostly women and children,

00:04:01.977 --> 00:04:05.166
and many of them were hacked to death.

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:08.069
During the past eight years,

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.007
fighting in the eastern provinces
has regularly reignited

00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:15.074
full-scale civil and international war.

00:04:15.074 --> 00:04:20.055
So basically, every time we feel
that we are on the brink of peace,

00:04:20.055 --> 00:04:22.897
the conflict explodes again.

00:04:22.897 --> 00:04:24.615
Why?

00:04:24.615 --> 00:04:27.587
Why have the massive international efforts

00:04:27.587 --> 00:04:34.096
failed to help Congo 
achieve lasting peace and security?

00:04:34.096 --> 00:04:41.064
Well, my answer to this question
revolves around two central observations.

00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:47.097
First, one of the main reasons
for the continuation of violence in Congo

00:04:47.097 --> 00:04:50.005
is fundamentally local --

00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:51.292
and when I say local,

00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:54.823
I really mean at the level
of the individual, the family,

00:04:54.823 --> 00:04:58.712
the clan, the municipality,
the community, the district,

00:04:58.712 --> 00:05:01.951
sometimes the ethnic group.

00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:06.479
For instance, you remember the story
of Isabelle that I told you.

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.683
Well, the reason why militias
had attacked Isabelle's village

00:05:10.683 --> 00:05:13.793
was because they wanted to take the land

00:05:13.793 --> 00:05:18.508
that the villagers needed
to cultivate food and to survive.

00:05:18.508 --> 00:05:23.278
The second central observation
is that international peace efforts

00:05:23.278 --> 00:05:27.242
have failed to help
address local conflicts

00:05:27.242 --> 00:05:32.161
because of the presence
of a dominant peacebuilding culture.

00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:35.777
So what I mean is that

00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:38.150
Western and African diplomats,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.997
United Nations peacekeepers, donors,

00:05:40.997 --> 00:05:43.601
the staff of most
nongovernmental organizations

00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:46.437
that work with the resolution of conflict,

00:05:46.437 --> 00:05:51.215
they all share a specific way
of seeing the world.

00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:55.221
And I was one of these people,
and I shared this culture,

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:59.213
so I know all too well how powerful it is.

00:05:59.213 --> 00:06:03.482
Throughout the world,
and throughout conflict zones,

00:06:03.482 --> 00:06:07.290
this common culture shapes
the intervener's understanding

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.774
of the causes of violence

00:06:09.774 --> 00:06:16.517
as something that is primarily located
in the national and international spheres.

00:06:16.517 --> 00:06:19.908
It shapes our understanding
of the path toward peace

00:06:19.908 --> 00:06:23.756
as something again that requires
top-down intervention

00:06:23.756 --> 00:06:27.879
to address national
and international tensions.

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.598
And it shapes our understanding
of the roles of foreign actors

00:06:31.598 --> 00:06:37.159
as engaging in national
and international peace processes.

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:41.034
Even more importantly,
this common culture

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:47.234
enables international peacebuilders
to ignore the micro-level tensions

00:06:47.234 --> 00:06:52.480
that often jeopardize
the macro-level settlements.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.581
So for instance, in Congo,

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:58.795
because of how they are
socialized and trained,

00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:01.181
United Nations officials,
donors, diplomats,

00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:04.340
the staff of most
nongovernmental organizations,

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:11.350
they interpret continued fighting
and massacres as a top-down problem.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.574
To them, the violence they see

00:07:13.574 --> 00:07:18.554
is the consequence of tensions
between President Kabila

00:07:18.554 --> 00:07:21.224
and various national opponents,

00:07:21.224 --> 00:07:26.217
and tensions between Congo,
Rwanda and Uganda.

00:07:26.217 --> 00:07:32.288
In addition, these international 
peacebuilders view local conflicts

00:07:32.288 --> 00:07:38.081
as simply the result
of national and international tensions,

00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:40.496
insufficient state authority,

00:07:40.496 --> 00:07:46.160
and what they call the Congolese people's
so-called inherent penchant for violence.

00:07:47.364 --> 00:07:51.316
The dominant culture
also constructs intervention

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:54.149
at the national and international levels

00:07:54.149 --> 00:08:01.362
as the only natural and legitimate task
for United Nations staffers and diplomats.

00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:05.721
And it elevates the organization
of general elections,

00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:07.807
which is now a sort of cure-all,

00:08:07.807 --> 00:08:11.591
as the most crucial state
reconstruction mechanism

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:15.116
over more effective
state-building approaches.

00:08:15.116 --> 00:08:21.343
And that happens not only in Congo
but also in many other conflict zones.

00:08:21.343 --> 00:08:23.243
But let's dig deeper,

00:08:23.243 --> 00:08:26.333
into the other main sources of violence.

00:08:27.193 --> 00:08:29.862
In Congo, continuing violence

00:08:29.862 --> 00:08:34.875
is motivated not only by the national
and international causes

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:39.182
but also by longstanding
bottom-up agendas

00:08:39.182 --> 00:08:43.143
whose main instigators
are villagers, traditional chiefs,

00:08:43.143 --> 00:08:46.141
community chiefs or ethnic leaders.

00:08:46.141 --> 00:08:52.116
Many conflicts revolve around political,
social and economic stakes

00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:54.944
that are distinctively local.

00:08:54.944 --> 00:08:57.920
For instance, there is
a lot of competition

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.308
at the village or district level

00:09:00.308 --> 00:09:03.894
over who can be chief of village
or chief of territory

00:09:03.894 --> 00:09:06.468
according to traditional law,

00:09:06.468 --> 00:09:09.696
and who can control
the distribution of land

00:09:09.696 --> 00:09:13.215
and the exploitation
of local mining sites.

00:09:13.215 --> 00:09:17.436
This competition often results
in localized fighting,

00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:21.220
for instance in one village or territory,

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.163
and quite frequently,
it escalates into generalized fighting,

00:09:25.163 --> 00:09:27.292
so across a whole province,

00:09:27.292 --> 00:09:30.631
and even at times
into neighboring countries.

00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:35.698
Take the conflict between Congolese 
of Rwandan descent

00:09:35.698 --> 00:09:40.609
and the so-called indigenous 
communities of the Kivus.

00:09:40.609 --> 00:09:45.995
This conflict started in the 1930s
during Belgian colonization,

00:09:45.995 --> 00:09:51.328
when both communities competed
over access to land and to local power.

00:09:51.328 --> 00:09:54.727
Then, in 1960,
after Congolese independence,

00:09:54.727 --> 00:10:00.572
it escalated because each camp
tried to align with national politicians,

00:10:00.578 --> 00:10:04.512
but still to advance their local agendas.

00:10:04.512 --> 00:10:08.880
And then, at the time
of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:15.059
these local actors allied
with Congolese and Rwandan armed groups,

00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:20.389
but still to advance their local agendas
in the provinces of the Kivus.

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:26.023
And since then, these local disputes
over land and local power

00:10:26.023 --> 00:10:27.743
have fueled violence,

00:10:27.743 --> 00:10:29.989
and they have regularly jeopardized

00:10:29.989 --> 00:10:33.712
the national and
international settlements.

00:10:35.542 --> 00:10:39.347
So we can wonder why
in these circumstances

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:44.029
the international peacebuilders
have failed to help implement

00:10:44.029 --> 00:10:47.407
local peacebuilding programs.

00:10:47.407 --> 00:10:52.253
And the answer is that
international interveners

00:10:52.253 --> 00:10:55.776
deem the resolution of grassroots conflict

00:10:55.776 --> 00:11:01.010
an unimportant, unfamiliar,
and illegitimate task.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:08.389
The very idea of becoming involved
at the local level clashes fundamentally

00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:10.497
with existing cultural norms,

00:11:10.497 --> 00:11:14.380
and it threatens
key organizational interests.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.997
For instance, the very identity
of the United Nations

00:11:18.997 --> 00:11:22.353
as this macro-level
diplomatic organization

00:11:22.353 --> 00:11:28.761
would be upended
if it were to refocus on local conflicts.

00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:33.486
And the result is that
neither the internal resistance

00:11:33.486 --> 00:11:35.833
to the dominant ways of working

00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:38.576
nor the external shocks

00:11:38.576 --> 00:11:43.018
have managed to convince international
actors that they should reevaluate

00:11:43.018 --> 00:11:46.858
their understanding
of violence and intervention.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.333
And so far, there have been
only very few exceptions.

00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:54.796
There have been exceptions,
but only very few exceptions,

00:11:54.796 --> 00:11:56.944
to this broad pattern.

00:11:58.214 --> 00:12:01.526
So to wrap up,
the story I just told you

00:12:01.526 --> 00:12:06.475
is a story about how
a dominant peacebuilding culture

00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:11.282
shapes the intervener's understanding
of what the causes of violence are,

00:12:11.282 --> 00:12:12.963
how peace is made,

00:12:12.963 --> 00:12:16.575
and what interventions should accomplish.

00:12:16.575 --> 00:12:20.324
These understandings enable
international peacebuilders

00:12:20.324 --> 00:12:23.402
to ignore the micro-level foundations

00:12:23.402 --> 00:12:28.051
that are so necessary
for sustainable peace.

00:12:28.051 --> 00:12:31.044
The resulting inattention
to local conflicts

00:12:31.044 --> 00:12:35.062
leads to inadequate peacebuilding
in the short term

00:12:35.062 --> 00:12:39.068
and potential war resumption
in the long term.

00:12:39.068 --> 00:12:42.214
And what's fascinating
is that this analysis

00:12:42.214 --> 00:12:46.224
helps us to better understand
many cases of lasting conflict

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:51.513
and international intervention failures,
in Africa and elsewhere.

00:12:51.513 --> 00:12:57.074
Local conflicts fuel violence
in most war and post-war environments,

00:12:57.074 --> 00:13:00.765
from Afghanistan to Sudan
to Timor-Leste,

00:13:00.765 --> 00:13:04.366
and in the rare cases
where there have been comprehensive,

00:13:04.366 --> 00:13:07.453
bottom-up peacebuilding initiatives,

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:12.947
these attempts have been successful
at making peace sustainable.

00:13:12.947 --> 00:13:15.757
One of the best examples is the contrast

00:13:15.757 --> 00:13:20.168
between the relatively peaceful
situation in Somaliland,

00:13:20.168 --> 00:13:25.378
which benefited from sustained
grassroots peacebuilding initiatives,

00:13:25.378 --> 00:13:29.586
and the violence prevalent
in the rest of Somalia,

00:13:29.586 --> 00:13:32.945
where peacebuilding
has been mostly top-down.

00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:35.246
And there are several other cases

00:13:35.246 --> 00:13:38.961
in which local, grassroots
conflict resolution

00:13:38.961 --> 00:13:41.980
has made a crucial difference.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.052
So if we want international
peacebuilding to work,

00:13:46.052 --> 00:13:49.874
in addition to any top-down intervention,

00:13:49.874 --> 00:13:53.545
conflicts must be resolved
from the bottom up.

00:13:53.545 --> 00:13:58.197
And again, it's not that national
and international tensions don't matter.

00:13:58.197 --> 00:13:59.923
They do.

00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:03.155
And it's not that national
and international peacebuilding

00:14:03.155 --> 00:14:04.617
isn't necessary.

00:14:04.617 --> 00:14:06.000
It is.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.255
Instead, it is that both macro-level
and micro-level peacebuilding are needed

00:14:13.255 --> 00:14:15.972
to make peace sustainable,

00:14:15.972 --> 00:14:18.113
and local nongovernmental organizations,

00:14:18.113 --> 00:14:21.092
local authorities and 
civil society representatives

00:14:21.092 --> 00:14:25.702
should be the main actors
in the bottom-up process.

00:14:25.702 --> 00:14:28.131
So of course, there are obstacles.

00:14:28.131 --> 00:14:30.786
Local actors often lack the funding

00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:34.323
and sometimes the logistical means
and the technical capacity

00:14:34.323 --> 00:14:38.857
to implement effective,
local peacebuilding programs.

00:14:38.857 --> 00:14:43.913
So international actors
should expand their funding and support

00:14:43.913 --> 00:14:47.700
for local conflict resolution.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.056
As for Congo, what can be done?

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:54.780
After two decades of conflict
and the deaths of millions,

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.815
it's clear that we need
to change our approach.

00:14:58.545 --> 00:15:00.223
Based on my field research,

00:15:00.223 --> 00:15:03.733
I believe that international
and Congolese actors

00:15:03.733 --> 00:15:07.159
should pay more attention
to the resolution of land conflict

00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:11.679
and the promotion
of inter-community reconciliation.

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:14.321
So for instance,
in the province of the Kivus,

00:15:14.321 --> 00:15:17.589
the Life and Peace Institute
and its Congolese partners

00:15:17.589 --> 00:15:20.684
have set up inter-community forums

00:15:20.684 --> 00:15:25.036
to discuss the specifics
of local conflicts over land,

00:15:25.036 --> 00:15:29.961
and these forums have found solutions
to help manage the violence.

00:15:30.671 --> 00:15:34.290
That's the kind of program
that is sorely needed

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.097
throughout eastern Congo.

00:15:37.097 --> 00:15:38.975
It's with programs like this

00:15:38.975 --> 00:15:43.925
that we can help people
like Isabelle and her husband.

00:15:43.925 --> 00:15:46.448
So these will not be magic wands,

00:15:46.448 --> 00:15:52.116
but because they take into account
deeply rooted causes of the violence,

00:15:52.116 --> 00:15:54.950
they could definitely be game-changers.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.504
Thank you.

00:15:57.504 --> 00:16:00.736
(Applause)
