00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.816
It has been 128 years

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.400
since the last country
in the world abolished slavery

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.656
and 53 years

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.760
since Martin Luther King pronounced
his "I Have A Dream" speech.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.976
But we still live in a world

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.200
where the color of our skin
not only gives a first impression,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.760
but a lasting one that remains.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.376
I was born in a family full of colors.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.416
My father is the son of a maid

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.520
from whom he inherited
an intense dark chocolate tone.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.976
He was adopted by those
who I know as my grandparents.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.256
The matriarch, my grandma,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.880
has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.296
My grandpa was somewhere between
a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.960
like my uncle and my cousin.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.536
My mother is a cinnamon-skin
daughter of a native Brazilian,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.240
with a pinch of hazel and honey,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.856
and a man [who is]
a mix of coffee with milk,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.600
but with a lot of coffee.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.656
She has two sisters.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.576
One in a toasted-peanut skin

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.016
and the other,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.576
also adopted,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.496
more on the beige side,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.816
like a pancake.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.216
(Laughter)

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.096
Growing up in this family,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.720
color was never important for me.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.040
Outside home, however,
things were different soon.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.880
Color had many other meanings.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.936
I remember my first
drawing lessons in school

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.896
as a bunch of contradictory feelings.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.856
It was exciting and creative

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.680
but I never understood
the unique flesh-colored pencil.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.735
I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink.

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.536
My skin was brown,
and people said I was black.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.720
I was seven years old
with a mess of colors in my head.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.160
Later,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.376
when I took my cousin to school,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.800
I was usually taken for the nanny.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.976
By helping in the kitchen
at a friend's party,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.120
people thought I was the maid.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.696
I was even treated like a prostitute

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.240
just because I was walking alone
on the beach with European friends.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.256
And many times,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.856
visiting my grandma or friends
in upper class buildings,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.816
I was invited not to use
the main elevator.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.216
Because in the end,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.936
with this color and this hair,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.880
I cannot belong to some places.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.616
In some way,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.176
I get to used to it and accept part of it.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.000
However, something inside of me
keeps revolving and struggling.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.880
Years later I married a Spaniard.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.616
But not any Spaniard.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.536
I chose one with the skin color
of a lobster when sunburnt.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.576
(Laughter)

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.936
Since then, a new question
started to chase me.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.320
What will be the color of your children?

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.680
As you can understand,
this is my last concern.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.976
But thinking about it,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.936
with my previous background,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.056
my story led me to make
my personal exercise as a photographer.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.920
And that is how Humanae was born.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.576
Humanae is a pursuit
to highlight our true colors,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.256
rather than the untrue

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.696
white, red, black or yellow
associated with race.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.056
It's a kind of game to question our codes.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.136
It's a work in progress
from a personal story to a global history.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.880
I portray the subjects
in a white background.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.776
Then I choose an 11-pixel
square from the nose,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.440
paint the background,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.320
and look for the corresponding color
in the industrial palette, Pantone.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.456
I started with my family and friends,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.376
then more and more people
joined the adventure,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.160
thanks to public calls
coming through the social media.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.016
I thought that the main space
to show my work was the Internet

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.576
because I want an open concept
that invites everybody

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.880
to push the share button
in both the computer and their brain.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.120
The snowball started to roll.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.000
The project had a great welcome --

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.216
invitations, exhibitions,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.976
physical formats,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
galleries and museums ...

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.536
just happened.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.120
And among them, my favorite:

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.320
when Humanae occupies public spaces

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.480
and appears in the street,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.040
it fosters a popular debate

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.280
and creates a feeling of community.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.896
I have portrayed more than 3,000 people

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.536
in 13 different countries,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.616
19 different cities around the world.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.176
Just to mention some of them --

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.736
from someone included in the Forbes list,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.216
to refugees who crossed
the Mediterranean by boat.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.656
In Paris, from the UNESCO
Headquarters to a shelter.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.600
And students both in Switzerland
and favelas in Rio de Janeiro.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.336
All kinds of beliefs,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.896
gender identities

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.520
or physical impairments,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.136
a newborn or terminally ill.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.000
We all together build Humanae.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.640
Those portraits make us rethink
how we see each other.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.976
When modern science
is questioning the race concept,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.880
what does it mean for us
to be black, white, yellow, red?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.080
Is it the eye, the nose,
the mouth, the hair?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.056
Or does it have to do with our origin,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.336
nationality

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.720
or bank account?

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.240
This personal exercise
turned out to be a discovery.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.856
Suddenly I realized that Humanae
was useful for many people.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.136
It represents a sort of mirror

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.720
for those who cannot find
themselves reflected in any label.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.616
It was amazing

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.000
that people started to share
their thoughts about the work with me.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.056
I have hundreds of that,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.880
I will share with you, too.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.880
A mother of 11 years --

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.400
A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.856
"Very good for me as a tool
to work on her confidence,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.936
as this past weekend

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.896
one of her girlfriends argued with her
that she does not belong

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.160
and should not be allowed
to live in Norway.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.936
So your work has
a very special place in my heart

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.760
and it's very important for me."

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.560
A woman shared her portrait
on Facebook and wrote,

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.856
"All my life,

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.976
people from across the globe
had difficulties to place me in a group,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.456
a stereotype,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.776
a box.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.976
Perhaps we should stop.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.136
Instead of framing, ask the individual,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.456
'How would you label yourself?'

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.296
Then I would say,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.336
'Hi. I'm Massiel.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.896
I'm a Dominican-Dutch,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.936
I grew up in a mixed family

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.840
and I'm a bisexual woman.' "

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.976
Besides these unexpected
and touching reactions,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.656
Humanae finds a new life
in a different variety of fields.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.840
Just to show you some examples,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.895
illustrators and art students

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:50.015
using it as a reference
for their sketches and their studies.

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:52.080
It's a collection of faces.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.776
Researchers in the fields of anthropology,

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.096
physics and neuroscience

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.256
use Humanae with different
scientific approaches

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.896
related to human ethnicity,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.656
optophysiology,

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.416
face recognition

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.640
or Alzheimer's.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.416
One of the most important
impacts of the project

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.096
is that Humanae was chosen
to be the cover of Foreign Affairs,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.200
one of the most relevant
political publications.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.256
And talking about foreign affairs,

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.000
I found the perfect
ambassadors for my project ...

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.896
teachers.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.880
They are the ones that use Humanae
as a tool for educational purposes.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.336
Their passion encourages me
to go back to drawing classes,

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.200
but this time as a teacher myself.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.656
My students,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.936
both adults and kids,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.736
paint their self-portraits,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.240
trying to discover
their own unique color.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.736
As a photographer,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:16.360
I realize that I can be a channel
for others to communicate.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.856
As an individual,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.160
as Angélica,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.256
every time I take a picture,

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.480
I feel that I am sitting
in front of a therapist.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.416
All the frustration, fear and loneliness

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.880
that I once felt ...

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.600
becomes love.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.800
The last country --

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.016
the last country in the world
who abolished slavery

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.360
is the country where I was born,

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.120
Brazil.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.200
We still have to work hard
to abolish discrimination.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.056
That remains a common practice worldwide,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.680
and that will not disappear by itself.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.736
Thank you.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:23.830
(Applause)

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.080
Thank you.
