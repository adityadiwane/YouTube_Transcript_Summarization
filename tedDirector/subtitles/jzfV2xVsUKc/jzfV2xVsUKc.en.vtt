00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.216
For the last year,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.896
everyone's been watching the same show,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.136
and I'm not talking
about "Game of Thrones,"

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.096
but a horrifying, real-life drama

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.376
that's proved too fascinating to turn off.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.096
It's a show produced by murderers

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.880
and shared around the world
via the Internet.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.536
Their names have become familiar:

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.456
James Foley, Steven Sotloff,
David Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.096
Haruna Yukawa, Kenji Goto Jogo.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.816
Their beheadings by the Islamic State

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.456
were barbaric,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.400
but if we think they were archaic,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.136
from a remote, obscure age,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.816
then we're wrong.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.576
They were uniquely modern,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.456
because the murderers acted knowing well

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.160
that millions of people
would tune in to watch.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.016
The headlines called them
savages and barbarians,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.496
because the image of one man
overpowering another,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.775
killing him with a knife to the throat,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.096
conforms to our idea
of ancient, primitive practices,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.800
the polar opposite
of our urban, civilized ways.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.920
We don't do things like that.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.776
But that's the irony.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.456
We think a beheading
has nothing to do with us,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.320
even as we click on the screen to watch.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.160
But it is to do with us.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.296
The Islamic State beheadings

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.016
are not ancient or remote.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.056
They're a global, 21st century event,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.016
a 21st century event that takes place
in our living rooms, at our desks,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.376
on our computer screens.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.720
They're entirely dependent
on the power of technology to connect us.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.456
And whether we like it or not,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.560
everyone who watches
is a part of the show.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.520
And lots of people watch.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.096
We don't know exactly how many.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.776
Obviously, it's difficult to calculate.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.456
But a poll taken in the UK,
for example, in August 2014,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.320
estimated that 1.2 million people

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.776
had watched the beheading of James Foley

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.440
in the few days after it was released.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.056
And that's just the first few days,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.280
and just Britain.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.096
A similar poll taken in the United States

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.840
in November 2014

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.696
found that nine percent of those surveyed

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.800
had watched beheading videos,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.776
and a further 23 percent

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.800
had watched the videos but had stopped
just before the death was shown.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.696
Nine percent may be a small minority
of all the people who could watch,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.776
but it's still a very large crowd.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.536
And of course that crowd
is growing all the time,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.696
because every week, every month,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.880
more people will keep downloading
and keep watching.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.536
If we go back 11 years,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.016
before sites like YouTube
and Facebook were born,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.776
it was a similar story.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.176
When innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.136
Nick Berg, Paul Johnson, were beheaded,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.776
those videos were shown
during the Iraq War.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.456
Nick Berg's beheading

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.280
quickly became one of the most
searched for items on the Internet.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.216
Within a day, it was the top search term

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.336
across search engines
like Google, Lycos, Yahoo.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.536
In the week after Nick Berg's beheading,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.800
these were the top 10 search terms
in the United States.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.776
The Berg beheading video remained
the most popular search term for a week,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.416
and it was the second most popular
search term for the whole month of May,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.160
runner-up only to "American Idol."

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.336
The al-Qaeda-linked website
that first showed Nick Berg's beheading

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.680
had to close down within a couple of days
due to overwhelming traffic to the site.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.736
One Dutch website owner said
that his daily viewing figures

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.576
rose from 300,000 to 750,000

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.560
every time a beheading in Iraq was shown.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.576
He told reporters 18 months later

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.976
that it had been downloaded
many millions of times,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.920
and that's just one website.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.256
A similar pattern was seen again and again

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.920
when videos of beheadings
were released during the Iraq War.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.896
Social media sites have made these images
more accessible than ever before,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.456
but if we take
another step back in history,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.616
we'll see that it was the camera
that first created a new kind of crowd

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.816
in our history of beheadings
as public spectacle.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.896
As soon as the camera
appeared on the scene,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.656
a full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.376
it had an immediate
and unequivocal effect.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.520
That day, the first film of a public
beheading was created in France.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.416
It was the execution, the guillotining,
of a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.160
outside the prison
Saint-Pierre in Versailles.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.216
Weidmann was due to be executed
at the crack of dawn,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.416
as was customary at the time,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.016
but his executioner was new to the job,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.896
and he'd underestimated
how long it would take him to prepare.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.056
So Weidmann was executed
at 4:30 in the morning,

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.456
by which time on a June morning,

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.040
there was enough light
to take photographs,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.016
and a spectator in the crowd
filmed the event,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.016
unbeknownst to the authorities.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.336
Several still photographs
were taken as well,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.496
and you can still watch
the film online today

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.640
and look at the photographs.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.376
The crowd on the day
of Weidmann's execution

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.376
was called "unruly"
and "disgusting" by the press,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.576
but that was nothing compared
to the untold thousands of people

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.216
who could now study the action

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.456
over and over again,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.760
freeze-framed in every detail.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.976
The camera may have made these scenes
more accessible than ever before,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.656
but it's not just about the camera.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.096
If we take a bigger leap back in history,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.296
we'll see that for as long
as there have been

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.416
public judicial executions and beheadings,

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.520
there have been the crowds to see them.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.056
In London, as late as
the early 19th century,

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.736
there might be four or five thousand
people to see a standard hanging.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.080
There could be 40,000 or 50,000
to see a famous criminal killed.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.496
And a beheading, which was
a rare event in England at the time,

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.840
attracted even more.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.200
In May 1820,

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.936
five men known as
the Cato Street Conspirators

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.096
were executed in London for plotting

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.720
to assassinate members
of the British government.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.096
They were hung and then decapitated.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.096
It was a gruesome scene.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.496
Each man's head was hacked off in turn
and held up to the crowd.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.696
And 100,000 people,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.336
that's 10,000 more than can fit
into Wembley Stadium,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.296
had turned out to watch.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.576
The streets were packed.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.816
People had rented out
windows and rooftops.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.856
People had climbed onto carts
and wagons in the street.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.976
People climbed lamp posts.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.800
People had been known to have died
in the crush on popular execution days.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.536
Evidence suggests
that throughout our history

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.896
of public beheadings
and public executions,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.256
the vast majority of the people
who come to see

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.480
are either enthusiastic
or, at best, unmoved.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.136
Disgust has been comparatively rare,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.376
and even when people
are disgusted and are horrified,

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.440
it doesn't always stop them
from coming out all the same to watch.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.816
Perhaps the most striking example

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.135
of the human ability to watch
a beheading and remain unmoved

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:49.496
and even be disappointed

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.976
was the introduction in France
in 1792 of the guillotine,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.216
that famous decapitation machine.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.856
To us in the 21st century,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.376
the guillotine may seem
like a monstrous contraption,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.560
but to the first crowds who saw it,
it was actually a disappointment.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.416
They were used to seeing long, drawn-out,
torturous executions on the scaffold,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.896
where people were mutilated
and burned and pulled apart slowly.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.896
To them, watching
the guillotine in action,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.096
it was so quick, there was nothing to see.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.336
The blade fell, the head fell
into a basket, out of sight immediately,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.056
and they called out,

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.920
"Give me back my gallows,
give me back my wooden gallows."

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.536
The end of torturous public
judicial executions in Europe and America

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.496
was partly to do with being
more humane towards the criminal,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.256
but it was also partly because the crowd
obstinately refused to behave

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.536
in the way that they should.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.896
All too often, execution day

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.080
was more like a carnival
than a solemn ceremony.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.336
Today, a public judicial execution
in Europe or America is unthinkable,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.096
but there are other scenarios
that should make us cautious

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.176
about thinking
that things are different now

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.520
and we don't behave like that anymore.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.176
Take, for example,
the incidents of suicide baiting.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.376
This is when a crowd gathers

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.016
to watch a person who has climbed
to the top of a public building

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.456
in order to kill themselves,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.456
and people in the crowd shout and jeer,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.560
"Get on with it! Go on and jump!"

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.096
This is a well-recognized phenomenon.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:46.376
One paper in 1981 found that in 10
out of 21 threatened suicide attempts,

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.256
there was incidents of suicide baiting
and jeering from a crowd.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.856
And there have been incidents
reported in the press this year.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.656
This was a very widely reported incident

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.656
in Telford and Shropshire
in March this year.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.296
And when it happens today,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.736
people take photographs
and they take videos on their phones

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.960
and they post those videos online.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.816
When it comes to brutal murderers
who post their beheading videos,

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.536
the Internet has created
a new kind of crowd.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.576
Today, the action takes place
in a distant time and place,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.896
which gives the viewer a sense
of detachment from what's happening,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.176
a sense of separation.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.936
It's nothing to do with me.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.240
It's already happened.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.936
We are also offered
an unprecedented sense of intimacy.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.656
Today, we are all offered front row seats.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.416
We can all watch in private,
in our own time and space,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.496
and no one need ever know
that we've clicked on the screen to watch.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.496
This sense of separation --

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.496
from other people,
from the event itself --

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.096
seems to be key to understanding
our ability to watch,

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.376
and there are several ways

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.656
in which the Internet
creates a sense of detachment

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.280
that seems to erode
individual moral responsibility.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.376
Our activities online
are often contrasted with real life,

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.480
as though the things we do online
are somehow less real.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.256
We feel less accountable for our actions

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.616
when we interact online.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.736
There's a sense of anonymity,
a sense of invisibility,

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.400
so we feel less accountable
for our behavior.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.416
The Internet also makes it far easier
to stumble upon things inadvertently,

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.056
things that we would usually avoid
in everyday life.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.936
Today, a video can start playing
before you even know what you're watching.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.976
Or you may be tempted to look at material
that you wouldn't look at in everyday life

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.120
or you wouldn't look at if you
were with other people at the time.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.016
And when the action is pre-recorded

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.256
and takes place
in a distant time and space,

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.256
watching seems like a passive activity.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.090
There's nothing I can do about it now.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.670
It's already happened.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.456
All these things make it easier
as an Internet user

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.296
for us to give in to our sense
of curiosity about death,

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.016
to push our personal boundaries,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.960
to test our sense of shock,
to explore our sense of shock.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.696
But we're not passive when we watch.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.216
On the contrary, we're fulfilling
the murderer's desire to be seen.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.696
When the victim of a decapitation
is bound and defenseless,

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.200
he or she essentially becomes
a pawn in their killer's show.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.376
Unlike a trophy head
that's taken in battle,

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.720
that represents the luck and skill
it takes to win a fight,

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.336
when a beheading is staged,

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.296
when it's essentially a piece of theater,

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.800
the power comes from the reception
the killer receives as he performs.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.616
In other words, watching
is very much part of the event.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.176
The event no longer takes place
in a single location

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.360
at a certain point in time as it used to
and as it may still appear to.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.136
Now the event is stretched out
in time and place,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.120
and everyone who watches plays their part.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.400
We should stop watching,

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.680
but we know we won't.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.896
History tells us we won't,

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.520
and the killers know it too.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.456
Thank you.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.976
(Applause)

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.896
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
Let me get this back. Thank you.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.816
Let's move here. While they install
for the next performance,

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.696
I want to ask you the question
that probably many here have,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.320
which is how did you
get interested in this topic?

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.376
Frances Larson: I used to work at a museum

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.336
called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.216
which was famous for its display
of shrunken heads from South America.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.176
People used to say, "Oh, the shrunken head
museum, the shrunken head museum!"

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.816
And at the time,
I was working on the history

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.856
of scientific collections of skulls.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.456
I was working on the cranial collections,

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.296
and it just struck me as ironic

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.096
that here were people coming to see
this gory, primitive, savage culture

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.640
that they were almost
fantasizing about and creating

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.341
without really understanding
what they were seeing,

00:15:24.365 --> 00:15:27.936
and all the while these vast --
I mean hundreds of thousands

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.096
of skulls in our museums,
all across Europe and the States --

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.376
were kind of upholding this Enlightenment
pursuit of scientific rationality.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.456
So I wanted to kind of twist it round
and say, "Let's look at us."

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.376
We're looking through the glass case
at these shrunken heads.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.936
Let's look at our own history and our own
cultural fascination with these things.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.777
BG: Thank you for sharing that.

00:15:51.802 --> 00:15:52.976
FL: Thank you.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.080
(Applause)
