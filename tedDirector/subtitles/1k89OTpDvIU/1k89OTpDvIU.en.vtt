00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.896
I design engineering projects

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.256
for middle school
and high school students,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.080
often using materials
that are pretty unexpected.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.856
My inspiration comes
from problems in my daily life.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.096
For example,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.136
one time I needed a costume
to go to a comic convention,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.216
but I didn't want to spend too much money,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.440
so I made my own ...

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.696
with a light-up crown and skirt.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.280
(Laughter)

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.856
Another time,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.816
I was devastated
because my favorite mobile game,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.056
Flappy Bird,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.736
was being taken off the app store.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.816
(Laughter)

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.376
So I was faced with the dilemma

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.296
to either never update my phone
or never play Flappy Bird again.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.200
(Laughter)

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.256
Unhappy with both options,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.816
I did the only thing
that made sense to me.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.016
I made a physical version of Flappy Bird

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.136
that could never be
taken off the app store.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.840
(Laughter)

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.600
(Music)

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.920
(Beeping)

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.616
(Music)

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.440
(Laughter)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.256
So a few of my friends
were also pretty addicted to the game,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.200
and I invited them to play as well.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.176
(Video) Friend: Ah!

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.760
(Laughter)

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.616
(Video) Friend: What the heck?

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.656
(Laughter)

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.656
And they told me that it was
just as infuriating as the original game.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.016
(Laughter)

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.416
So I uploaded a demo
of this project online,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.936
and to my surprise it went viral.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.056
It had over two million views
in just a few days.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.496
(Laughter)

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.736
And what's more interesting
are people's comments.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.176
A lot of people
wanted to make it their own,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.056
or asked me how it was made.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.376
So this kind of confirmed my idea
that through a creative project,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.560
we can teach people about engineering.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.576
With the money made from the viral video,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.856
we were able to let students
in our classroom

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.960
all make their own game in a box.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.416
Although it was pretty challenging,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.640
they learned a lot of new concepts
in engineering and programming.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.496
And they were all eager to learn
so they could finish the game as well.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.919
(Laughter)

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.056
So before Flappy Bird Box,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.616
I had the idea of using creative
engineering projects to teach students.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.896
When I was teaching at a middle school,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.736
we asked our students to build a robot
from a standard technology kit.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.656
And I noticed that
a lot of them seemed bored.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.456
Then a few of them
started taking pieces of paper

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.096
and decorating their robots.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.056
And then more of them got into it,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.696
and they became
more interested in the project.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.616
So I started looking
for more creative ways

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.000
to introduce technology to students.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.696
What I found was that most technology kits
available in school

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.576
look a little intimidating.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.760
They're all made of plastic parts
that you can't customize.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.176
On top of that,
they're all very expensive,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.656
costing hundreds of dollars per kit.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.720
So that's certainly not very affordable
for most classroom budgets.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.776
Since I didn't find anything,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.016
I decided to make something on my own.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.976
I started with paper and fabric.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.176
After all, we all played
with those since we were kids,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.736
and they are also pretty cheap

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.520
and can be found
anywhere around the house.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.896
And I prototyped a project

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.496
where students
can create a light-up creature

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.016
using fabric and googly eyes.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.256
They were all helping
each other in classrooms,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.696
and were laughing
and discussing the project.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.936
And most importantly,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.920
they were able to insert
their own creativity into the project.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.736
So because of the success of this project,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.456
I continued to create
more engineering projects

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.336
to challenge my students.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.256
And I also started to take
these workshops outside of school

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.816
and into the community.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.176
And something really interesting happened.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.216
I noticed a lot of people
from very diverse backgrounds

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.616
started coming to our workshops.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.016
And specifically,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.896
there were a lot more women
and minorities than I expected,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.320
and that you wouldn't usually see
at a traditional engineering workshop.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.176
Now take a look at this employee report
at a major technology company in 2016.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.256
Women make up only 19 percent
of the technology workforce.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.680
And underrepresented minorities
make up only four percent.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.495
This statistic might look familiar

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:37.056
if you walked into
a high school robotics club,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.040
or a college engineering class.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.016
Now, there's a wide variety of problems

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.416
that contribute to the lack of diversity
in the technology force.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.496
Perhaps one solution could be

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.000
to introduce technology to students
through creative projects.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.016
I'm not saying that this
could solve everything,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.216
but it could introduce technology

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.896
to people who originally
wouldn't be interested in it

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.840
because of how it has been
portrayed and taught in school.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.896
So how do we start to change
the perception of technology?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.536
Most students think
that it's boring or unwelcoming,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.336
so I have always designed projects
following three principles.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.856
First is having a low floor,

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.960
and that means this project
is easy to get started.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.856
So take a look at this tutorial.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.976
The first project
we asked students to learn

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.096
is to make a circuit on paper.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.616
As you can see, it doesn't
take very long to learn,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.960
and it's pretty easy even for beginners.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.416
And having a low floor also means
that we're removing the financial barrier

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.456
that prevents people
from completing a project.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.336
So with paper, copper tape,
lightbulb and a battery,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.520
people can complete this project
for under a dollar.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.736
So second principle
is having a high ceiling.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.816
This means that there's
a lot of room to grow,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.120
and students are
constantly being challenged.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.976
At first it might just be
a light-up creature,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.816
but then you can add sensors
and microcontrollers,

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.576
and start to program the creature
to interact with its environment.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.976
(Laughter)

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.336
And finally,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.816
the third principle is customization.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.856
This means that we can make
this project relevant to anyone.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.376
That's the beauty
of using everyday materials;

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.600
it's very easy to customize
using paper and fabric.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.336
So even if you don't like Flappy Bird,

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.000
you can still make your own game.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.896
(Video) Student: So our game
is about Justin Bieber,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.616
because he's been speeding,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.336
and the object is to prevent him
from getting caught by the LAPD --

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.640
(Laughter)

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.176
(Video) Student:
Yeah, but he's changing so --

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.336
we're a part of his posse.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.456
(Laughter)

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.696
Thank you.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.343
(Applause)
