00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.885
Usually I like working in my shop,

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:22.218
but when it's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river,

00:00:22.218 --> 00:00:24.258
then I just love it.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:27.589
And I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water,

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.468
and maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers.

00:00:30.468 --> 00:00:33.400
You have no idea how much time I spend.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.427
This is the "Double Raindrop."

00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:38.552
Of all my sculptures, it's the most talkative.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.702
It adds together the interference pattern

00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:49.981
from two raindrops that land near each other.

00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:55.128
Instead of expanding circles, they're expanding hexagons.

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:04.489
All the sculptures move by mechanical means.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.385
Do you see how there's three peaks to the yellow sine wave?

00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:20.485
Right here I'm adding a sine wave with four peaks and turning it on.

00:01:35.904 --> 00:01:39.370
Eight hundred two-liter soda bottles --

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.114
oh yea.

00:01:41.114 --> 00:01:43.350
(Laughter)

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:57.177
Four hundred aluminum cans.

00:01:59.777 --> 00:02:02.537
Tule is a reed that's native to California,

00:02:02.537 --> 00:02:07.803
and the best thing about working with it is that it smells just delicious.

00:02:21.095 --> 00:02:24.043
A single drop of rain

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.558
increasing amplitude.

00:02:48.143 --> 00:02:53.369
The spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip.

00:03:03.523 --> 00:03:06.398
This adds together four different waves.

00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:09.319
And here I'm going to pull out the double wavelengths

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.667
and increase the single.

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:15.608
The mechanism that drives it has nine motors

00:03:15.608 --> 00:03:18.130
and about 3,000 pulleys.

00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:32.433
Four hundred and forty-five strings in a three-dimensional weave.

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:35.272
Transferred to a larger scale --

00:03:35.272 --> 00:03:38.350
actually a lot larger, with a lot of help --

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.117
14,064 bicycle reflectors --

00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:45.866
a 20-day install.

00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:06.635
"Connected" is a collaboration

00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:10.439
with choreographer Gideon Obarzanek.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.780
Strings attached to dancers.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.202
This is very early rehearsal footage,

00:04:16.202 --> 00:04:18.564
but the finished work's on tour

00:04:18.564 --> 00:04:22.937
and is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks.

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:32.431
A pair of helices and 40 wooden slats.

00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:56.260
Take your finger and draw this line.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Summer, fall, winter, spring,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.497
noon, dusk, dark, dawn.

00:05:06.497 --> 00:05:09.760
Have you ever seen those stratus clouds

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.433
that go in parallel stripes across the sky?

00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:15.028
Did you know that's a continuous sheet of cloud

00:05:15.028 --> 00:05:18.625
that's dipping in and out of the condensation layer?

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:21.458
What if every seemingly isolated object

00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:25.302
was actually just where the continuous wave of that object

00:05:25.302 --> 00:05:28.783
poked through into our world?

00:05:28.783 --> 00:05:33.160
The Earth is neither flat nor round.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.583
It's wavy.

00:05:37.583 --> 00:05:43.081
It sounds good, but I'll bet you know in your gut that it's not the whole truth,

00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:44.639
and I'll tell you why.

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.635
I have a two-year-old daughter who's the best thing ever.

00:05:46.635 --> 00:05:48.718
And I'm just going to come out and say it:

00:05:48.718 --> 00:05:52.253
My daughter is not a wave.

00:05:52.253 --> 00:05:56.833
And you might say, "Surely, Rueben, if you took even just the slightest step back,

00:05:56.833 --> 00:05:59.593
the cycles of hunger and eating,

00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:02.433
waking and sleeping, laughing and crying

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:05.044
would emerge as pattern."

00:06:05.044 --> 00:06:07.671
But I would say, "If I did that,

00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:11.160
too much would be lost."

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.889
This tension between the need to look deeper

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.843
and the beauty and immediacy of the world,

00:06:18.843 --> 00:06:22.545
where if you even try to look deeper you've already missed what you're looking for,

00:06:22.545 --> 00:06:25.616
this tension is what makes the sculptures move.

00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:28.127
And for me, the path between these two extremes

00:06:28.127 --> 00:06:30.862
takes the shape of a wave.

00:06:30.862 --> 00:06:33.929
Let me show you one more.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.789
Thank you very much. Thanks.

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.970
(Applause)

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.202
Thanks.

00:07:22.202 --> 00:07:26.666
(Applause)

00:07:26.666 --> 00:07:28.439
June Cohen: Looking at each of your sculptures,

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:30.867
they evoke so many different images.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.402
Some of them are like the wind and some are like waves,

00:07:33.402 --> 00:07:36.287
and sometimes they look alive and sometimes they seem like math.

00:07:36.287 --> 00:07:38.791
Is there an actual inspiration behind each one?

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:42.347
Are you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it?

00:07:42.347 --> 00:07:45.487
RM: Well some of them definitely have a direct observation --

00:07:45.487 --> 00:07:48.302
like literally two raindrops falling,

00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:51.177
and just watching that pattern is so stunning.

00:07:51.177 --> 00:07:56.866
And then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff.

00:07:56.881 --> 00:07:59.410
I like working with my hands.

00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:01.635
There's nothing better than cutting a piece of wood

00:08:01.635 --> 00:08:03.385
and trying to make it move.

00:08:03.385 --> 00:08:05.135
JC: And does it ever change?

00:08:05.135 --> 00:08:06.260
Do you think you're designing one thing,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.010
and then when it's produced it looks like something else?

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.468
RM: The "Double Raindrop" I worked on for nine months,

00:08:11.468 --> 00:08:13.794
and when I finally turned it on,

00:08:13.825 --> 00:08:17.468
I actually hated it.

00:08:17.468 --> 00:08:21.593
The very moment I turned it on, I hated it.

00:08:21.593 --> 00:08:24.941
It was like a really deep-down gut reaction, and I wanted to throw it out.

00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:27.085
And I happened to have a friend who was over,

00:08:27.085 --> 00:08:29.097
and he said, "Why don't you just wait."

00:08:29.097 --> 00:08:33.466
And I waited, and the next day I liked it a bit better,

00:08:33.466 --> 00:08:36.427
the next day I liked it a bit better, and now I really love it.

00:08:36.427 --> 00:08:41.093
And so I guess, one, the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes,

00:08:41.093 --> 00:08:43.635
and two, it does not look like as expected.

00:08:43.635 --> 00:08:46.052
JC: The relationship evolves over time.

00:08:46.052 --> 00:08:46.927
Well thank you so much. That was a gorgeous treat for us.

00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:49.814
RM: Thanks. (JC: Thank you, Reuben.)

00:08:49.814 --> 00:08:52.177
(Applause)
