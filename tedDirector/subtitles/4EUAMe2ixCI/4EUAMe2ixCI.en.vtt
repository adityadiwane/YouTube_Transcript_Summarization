00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.260
So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I've loved only two.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
That first one,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
it was more like a passionate affair.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
It was a beautiful fish:

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
flavorful, textured, meaty,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
a bestseller on the menu.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
What a fish.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
(Laughter)

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Even better,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
of sustainability.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
So you could feel good about selling it.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
I was in a relationship with this beauty

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
for several months.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
One day, the head of the company called

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and asked if I'd speak at an event

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
about the farm's sustainability.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
"Absolutely," I said.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Here was a company trying to solve

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs:

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
How do we keep fish on our menus?

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
For the past 50 years,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
we've been fishing the seas

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
like we clear-cut forests.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
It's hard to overstate the destruction.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love --

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish --

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
they've collapsed.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
There's almost nothing left.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
So, for better or for worse,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
A lot of arguments against it:

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway --

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and they're inefficient. Take tuna,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
a major drawback.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
It's got a feed conversion ratio

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
of 15 to one.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
to get you one pound of farm tuna.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Not very sustainable.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
It doesn't taste very good either.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
So here, finally,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
was a company trying to do it right.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
I wanted to support them.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
The day before the event,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
I called the head of P.R. for the company.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Let's call him Don.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
"Don," I said, "just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute."

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
"That's right," he said. "We're so far out,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
the waste from our fish gets distributed,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
not concentrated."

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
And then he added,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
"We're basically a world unto ourselves.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
That feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one," he said.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
"Best in the business."

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
2.5 to one, great.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
"2.5 what? What are you feeding?"

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
"Sustainable proteins," he said.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
"Great," I said. Got off the phone.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought:

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
What the hell is a sustainable protein?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.260
(Laughter)

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
So the next day, just before the event, I called Don.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.260
I said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
He said he didn't know. He would ask around.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company;

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
no one could give me a straight answer

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
until finally, I got on the phone

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
with the head biologist.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Let's call him Don too.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.260
(Laughter)

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
"Don," I said,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
"what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Well, he mentioned some algaes

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
and some fish meals,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and then he said chicken pellets.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
I said, "Chicken pellets?"

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
He said, "Yeah, feathers, skin,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
bone meal, scraps,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
dried and processed into feed."

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
I said, "What percentage

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
of your feed is chicken?"

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Thinking, you know, two percent.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
I said, "Don, what's sustainable

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
about feeding chicken to fish?"

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.260
(Laughter)

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
There was a long pause on the line,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world."

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.260
(Laughter)

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
I fell out of love with this fish.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
(Laughter)

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
No, not because I'm some self-righteous,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
goody-two shoes foodie.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
I actually am.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
(Laughter)

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:58.260
(Laughter)

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
This second fish,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
it's a different kind of love story.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
It's the romantic kind,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
the kind where the more you get to know your fish,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
you love the fish.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
I first ate it at a restaurant

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
in southern Spain.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
She kind of set us up.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
(Laughter)

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
It came to the table

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
a bright, almost shimmering, white color.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
The chef had overcooked it.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Like twice over.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Amazingly, it was still delicious.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.260
Who can make a fish taste good

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
after it's been overcooked?

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
I can't,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
but this guy can.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Let's call him Miguel --

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
actually his name is Miguel.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
(Laughter)

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
at least in the way that you and I understand it.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
He's a biologist

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
at Veta La Palma.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Until the 1980s,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
They raised beef cattle

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
on what was essentially wetlands.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
They did it by draining the land.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
They built this intricate series of canals,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and they pushed water off the land and out into the river.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Well, they couldn't make it work,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
not economically.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And ecologically, it was a disaster.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
It killed like 90 percent of the birds,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
which, for this place, is a lot of birds.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And so in 1982,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
a Spanish company with an environmental conscience

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
purchased the land.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
What did they do?

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
They reversed the flow of water.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
They literally flipped the switch.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Instead of pushing water out,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
they used the channels to pull water back in.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
They flooded the canals.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.260
They created a 27,000-acre fish farm --

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
bass, mullet,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
shrimp, eel --

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and in the process, Miguel and this company

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
completely reversed the ecological destruction.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
The farm's incredible.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
I mean, you've never seen anything like this.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
You stare out at a horizon

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
that is a million miles away,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
and all you see are flooded canals

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and this thick, rich marshland.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
I was there not long ago with Miguel.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
He's an amazing guy,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
(Laughter)

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
Okay? There we are slogging through the wetlands,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
Here, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Now, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
And here, here he sees a grouping pattern

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
It turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
I asked him how he became

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
such an expert on fish.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
He said, "Fish? I didn't know anything about fish.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
I'm an expert in relationships."

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
And then he's off, launching into more talk

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
about rare birds and algaes

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
and strange aquatic plants.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
And don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
the biotic community unplugged, kind of thing.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
It's great, but I was in love.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
And my head was swooning over that

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
So I interrupted him. I said,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
"Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?"

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
He pointed at the algae.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
"I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
the relationships: It's amazing.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
But what are your fish eating?

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
What's the feed conversion ratio?"

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
Well, he goes on to tell me

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
it's such a rich system

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
The plant biomass, the phytoplankton,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
The system is so healthy,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
it's totally self-renewing.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
There is no feed.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals?

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
Later that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.260
and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
unlike like any farm I'd ever been at,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
how do you measure success?"

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
At that moment, it was as if

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
a film director called for a set change.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
And we rounded the corner

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
and saw the most amazing sight:

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
thousands and thousands of pink flamingos,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.260
a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
"That's success," he said.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
"Look at their bellies, pink.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
They're feasting."

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Feasting? I was totally confused.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
I said, "Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?"

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
(Laughter)

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
"Yes," he said.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:24.260
(Laughter)

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
"We lose 20 percent of our fish

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and fish eggs to birds.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
Well, last year, this property

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
had 600,000 birds on it,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
more than 250 different species.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
It's become, today, the largest

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
and one of the most important

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.260
private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe."

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
I said, "Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
like the last thing you want on a fish farm?"

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
(Laughter)

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
He shook his head, no.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
He said, "We farm extensively,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
not intensively.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
This is an ecological network.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
The flamingos eat the shrimp.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
So the pinker the belly,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
the better the system."

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
Okay, so let's review:

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
a farm that doesn't feed its animals,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
and a farm that measures its success

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
on the health of its predators.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
Oh, and by the way, those flamingos,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
they shouldn't even be there in the first place.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
They brood in a town

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
150 miles away,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
where the soil conditions

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
are better for building nests.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
Every morning, they fly

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
150 miles into the farm.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And every evening, they fly 150 miles back.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:52.260
(Laughter)

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
They do that because they're able to follow

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
the broken white line

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
of highway A92.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
(Laughter)

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
No kidding.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
I was imagining a "March of the Penguins" thing,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
so I looked at Miguel.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
I said, "Miguel, do they fly

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
150 miles to the farm,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
and then do they fly

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
150 miles back at night?

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
Do they do that for the children?"

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.260
(Laughter)

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
He said, "No; they do it because the food's better."

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
(Laughter)

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.260
I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
which was delicious -- and I don't like fish skin;

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
I don't like it seared, I don't like it crispy.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
It's that acrid, tar-like flavor.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
I almost never cook with it.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
it tasted not at all like fish skin.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
It tasted sweet and clean,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
like you were taking a bite of the ocean.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
He said, "The skin acts like a sponge.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
It's the last defense before anything enters the body.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
It evolved to soak up impurities."

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
And then he added,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
"But our water has no impurities."

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
a farm that measures its success

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
by the success of its predators.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
And then I realized when he says,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
"A farm that has no impurities,"

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
he made a big understatement,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
because the water that flows through that farm

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
comes in from the Guadalquivir River.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
It's a river that carries with it

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
all the things that rivers tend to carry these days:

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
chemical contaminants,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
pesticide runoff.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
And when it works its way through the system

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
and leaves,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
the water is cleaner than when it entered.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
The system is so healthy, it purifies the water.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
not just a farm that measures its success

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
by the health of its predators,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
but a farm that's literally a water purification plant --

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
and not just for those fish,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
but for you and me as well.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
A drop in the ocean, I know,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
but I'll take it, and so should you,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
because this love story,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
however romantic,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
is also instructive.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
You might say it's a recipe

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
for the future of good food,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
What we need now is

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
a radically new conception of agriculture,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
one in which the food actually tastes good.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
(Laughter)

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:02.260
(Applause)

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
But for a lot people,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
that's a bit too radical.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
We're not realists, us foodies;

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
we're lovers.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
We love farmers' markets,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
we love small family farms,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
we talk about local food,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
we eat organic.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
And when you suggest these are the things

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.260
that will ensure the future of good food,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
someone, somewhere stands up and says,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.260
"Hey guy, I love pink flamingos,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
but how are you going to feed the world?"

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
How are you going to feed the world?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
Can I be honest?

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
I don't love that question.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
No, not because we already produce

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
enough calories to more than feed the world.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
One billion people will go hungry today.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
One billion -- that's more than ever before --

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
because of gross inequalities in distribution,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
not tonnage.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
of our food system for the last 50 years.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
Feed grain to herbivores,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
chicken to fish,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
and all along agribusiness

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
has simply asked,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
"If we're feeding more people more cheaply,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
how terrible could that be?"

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
That's been the motivation,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
it's been the justification:

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
it's been the business plan

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
of American agriculture.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
We should call it what it is:

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
a business in liquidation,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
a business that's quickly eroding

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
ecological capital that makes that very production possible.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
That's not a business,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
and it isn't agriculture.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
Our breadbasket is threatened today,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
not because of diminishing supply,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
but because of diminishing resources.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
Not by the latest combine and tractor invention,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
but by fertile land;

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
not by pumps, but by fresh water;

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
not by chainsaws, but by forests;

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
Want to feed the world?

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves?

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
Or better: How can we create conditions

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
that enable every community

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
to feed itself?

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:32.260
(Applause)

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
To do that,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
don't look at the agribusiness model for the future.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
It's really old, and it's tired.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.260
It's high on capital, chemistry and machines,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
and it's never produced anything really good to eat.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.260
Instead, let's look to the ecological model.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.260
That's the one that relies on two billion years

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
of on-the-job experience.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
Look to Miguel,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
farmers like Miguel.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.260
Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves;

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:10.260
farms that restore instead of deplete;

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
farms that farm extensively

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
instead of just intensively;

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
farmers that are not just producers,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
but experts in relationships.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260
Because they're the ones

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.260
that are experts in flavor, too.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.260
And if I'm going to be really honest,

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.260
they're a better chef than I'll ever be.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.260
You know, I'm okay with that,

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.260
because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.260
Thank you.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:54.260
(Applause)
