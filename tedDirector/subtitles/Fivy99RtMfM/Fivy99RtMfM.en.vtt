00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.666
(Mosquito buzzing)

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.240
(Swat)

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.630
Gotcha.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.160
Mosquitoes.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.080
I hate them.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.320
Don't you?

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.576
That awful buzzing sound at night
around your ears

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.200
that drives you absolutely crazy?

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.776
Knowing that she wants
to stick a needle in your skin

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.000
and suck out your blood?

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.720
That's awful, right?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.840
In fact, there's only one good thing
I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.920
When they fly into our bedroom at night,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.134
they prefer to bite my wife.

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:56.816
(Laughter)

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.296
But that's fascinating, right?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.760
Why does she receive more bites than I do?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.016
And the answer is smell,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.240
the smell of her body.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.976
And since we all smell different
and produce chemicals on our skin

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.936
that either attract or repel mosquitoes,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.640
some of us are just
more attractive than others.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.600
So my wife smells nicer than I do,
or I just stink more than she does.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.776
Either way, mosquitoes find us in the dark
by sniffing us out. They smell us.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.096
And during my PhD,
I wanted to know exactly

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.200
what chemicals from our skin
African malaria mosquitoes use

00:01:37.224 --> 00:01:38.464
to track us down at night.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.320
And there's a whole range
of compounds that they do use.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.800
And this was not going to be an easy task.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.640
And therefore we set up
various experiments.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.816
Why did we set up these experiments?

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.136
Because half the world's population

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.456
runs the risk of contracting
a killer disease like malaria

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.040
through a simple mosquito bite.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.256
Every 30 seconds,
somewhere on this planet,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.736
a child dies of malaria,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.656
and Paul Levy this morning,
he was talking about the metaphor

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.176
of the 727 crashing
into the United States.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.856
Well, in Africa, we have
the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.160
crashing every day.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.615
But perhaps if we can attract
these mosquitoes to traps,

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.216
bait it with our smell,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.160
we may be able
to stop transmission of disease.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.576
Now, solving this puzzle
was not an easy thing,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.576
because we produce hundreds
of different chemicals on the skin,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.256
but we undertook
some remarkable experiments

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.576
that managed us to resolve
this puzzle very quickly indeed.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.936
First, we observed
that not all mosquito species

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.880
bite on the same part of the body.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.816
Strange.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.416
So we set up an experiment

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.797
where we put a naked volunteer
in a large cage,

00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:52.836
(Laughter)

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.296
and in that cage, we released mosquitoes

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.000
to see where they were biting
on the body of that person.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.560
And we found some remarkable differences.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.016
On the left here you see the bites

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.296
by the Dutch malaria mosquito
on this person.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.000
They had a very strong preference
for biting on the face.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.336
In contrast, the African malaria mosquito

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.536
had a very strong preference for biting
the ankles and feet of this person.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.016
And that, of course,
we should have known all along,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.176
because they're called
mosqui-toes, you see?

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.536
(Laughter)

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.776
That's right.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.056
(Applause)

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.440
And so we started
focusing on the smell of feet ...

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.056
on the smell of human feet,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.816
until we came across
a remarkable statement in the literature

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.616
that said that cheese smells after feet

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.240
rather than the reverse.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.296
Think of it.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.749
And this triggered us
to do a remarkable experiment.

00:03:48.773 --> 00:03:53.816
We tried, with a tiny little piece
of Limburger cheese,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.600
which smells badly after feet,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.376
to attract African malaria mosquitoes.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.280
And you know what? It worked.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.416
In fact, it worked so well

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.976
that now we have a synthetic mixture
of the aroma of Limburger cheese

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.776
that we're using in Tanzania

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.016
and has been shown there

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.000
to be two to three times
more attractive to mosquitoes than humans.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.256
Limburg, be proud of your cheese,

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.416
as it is now used
in the fight against malaria.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.698
(Applause)

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:32.399
That's the cheese, just to show you.

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:35.880
My second story is remarkable as well.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.080
It's about man's best friend.
It's about dogs.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.320
And I will show you how we can use dogs
in the fight against malaria.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.736
One of the best ways of killing mosquitoes

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.056
is not to wait until
they fly around like adults

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.960
and bite people and transmit disease.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.200
It's to kill them when they're still
in the water as larvae.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.136
Why?

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.520
Because they are just like the CIA.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.456
In that pool of water,
these larvae are concentrated.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.136
They're all together there.
They are immobile.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.816
They can't escape from that water.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.416
They can't fly.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.136
And they're accessible.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.200
You can actually walk up to that pool
and you can kill them there, right?

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.736
So the problem that we face with this

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.656
is that, throughout the landscape,
all these pools of water with the larvae,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.656
they are scattered all over the place,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.896
which makes it very hard
for an inspector like this

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.480
to actually find all these breeding sites
and treat them with insecticides.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.240
And last year we thought very, very hard,
how can we resolve this problem?

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.416
Until we realized that just like us --
we have a unique smell --

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.720
mosquito larvae
also have a very unique smell.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.656
And so we set up another crazy experiment,

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.016
because we collected
the smell of these larvae,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.320
put it on pieces of cloth,
and then did something very remarkable.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.376
Here we have a bar with four holes

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.176
and we put the smell
of these larvae in the left hole.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.416
Oh, that was very quick.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.576
And then you see the dog.
It's called Tweed. It's a border collie.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.216
He's examining these holes
and now he's got it already.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.576
He's going back to check
the control holes again,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.456
but he's coming back to the first one,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.296
and now he's locking into that smell,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.936
which means that now,
we can use dogs with these inspectors

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.176
to much better find the breeding sites
of mosquitoes in the field,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.600
and therefore have
a much bigger impact on malaria.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.936
This lady is Ellen van der Zweep.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.199
She's one of the best
dog trainers in the world,

00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:33.263
and she believes
that we can do a lot more.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.616
Since we also know that people
that carry malaria parasites

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.496
smell different compared to people
that are uninfected,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.920
she's convinced that we can train dogs
to find people that carry the parasite.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.216
That means that in a population
where malaria has gone down all the way

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.656
and there's few people
remaining with parasites,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.416
that the dogs can find these people,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.336
we can treat them with antimalarial drugs
and give the final blow to malaria.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.640
Man's best friend
in the fight against malaria.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.446
My third story is perhaps
even more remarkable ...

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.756
and, I should say, has never been shown
to the public until today.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.781
(Audience cheers)

00:07:09.805 --> 00:07:11.005
Yeah.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.736
It's a crazy story, but I believe
it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.960
against mosquitoes ever.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.936
In fact, people have told me

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.440
that now they will enjoy
being bitten by mosquitoes.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.056
And the question of course is,

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.240
what would make someone
enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.120
And the answer I have right here ...

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.522
in my pocket --

00:07:34.546 --> 00:07:35.547
(Laughter)

00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:36.771
if I get it.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.160
It's a tablet.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.216
A simple tablet,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.600
and when I take it with water ...

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.080
it does miracles.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.240
Thank you.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.280
Now, let me show you how this works.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.680
Here in this box, I have a cage

00:08:04.014 --> 00:08:10.992
with several hundred
hungry female mosquitoes ...

00:08:11.016 --> 00:08:12.296
(Laughter)

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.776
that I'm just about to release.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.576
(Laughter)

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.941
Just kidding, just kidding.

00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:19.336
(Laughter)

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.416
What I'm going to show you
is, I'm gonna stick my arm into it

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.720
and I will show you
how quickly they will bite.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.680
There we go.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.671
Don't worry, I do this
all the time in the lab.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.520
There we go.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.760
OK.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.240
Now, on the video --

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.136
on the video here,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.296
I'm going to show you
exactly the same thing,

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.456
except that what
I'm showing you on the video

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.280
happened one hour after I took the tablet.

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:48.000
Have a look.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.936
That doesn't work.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.159
OK. Sorry about that.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.576
I'm sticking in my arm,
I'm giving them a big juicy blood meal,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.096
I'm shaking them off,
and we follow them through time

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.616
to see these mosquitoes
get very, very sick indeed,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.160
here shown in fast motion.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.856
And three hours later,
what we see at the bottom of the cage

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.080
is dead mosquitoes ...

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.960
very dead mosquitoes.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.816
And I'm going to say,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.840
we have swapped the cards with mosquitoes.

00:09:14.864 --> 00:09:18.416
They don't kill us. We kill them.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:25.440
(Applause)

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.840
Now --

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.136
(Laughter)

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.680
Maastricht, be prepared.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.296
Now, think of what we can do with this.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.456
We can actually use this
to contain outbreaks

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.560
of mosquito-born diseases,
of epidemics, right?

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.176
And better still,
imagine what would happen

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.400
if, in a very large area, everyone would
take these drugs, for just three weeks.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.536
That would give us an opportunity

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.680
to actually eliminate
malaria as a disease.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.296
So cheese, dogs and a pill
to kill mosquitoes.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.280
That's the kind of out-of-the-box
science that I love doing ...

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.136
for the betterment of mankind,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.776
but especially for her,

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.696
so that she can grow up
in a world without malaria.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.936
Thank you.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.341
