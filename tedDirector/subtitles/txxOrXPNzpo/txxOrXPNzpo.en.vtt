00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.316
Photography has been my passion

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:20.094
ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera,

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:22.454
but today I want to share with you

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:25.736
the 15 most treasured photos of mine,

00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:27.331
and I didn't take any of them.

00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:30.222
There were no art directors, no stylists,

00:00:30.222 --> 00:00:34.658
no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting.

00:00:34.658 --> 00:00:38.934
In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists.

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:40.446
My story begins

00:00:40.446 --> 00:00:42.964
when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement,

00:00:42.964 --> 00:00:45.727
and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter

00:00:45.727 --> 00:00:50.163
on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th.

00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:53.704
We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later,

00:00:53.704 --> 00:00:57.103
so we decided to take the same picture.

00:00:57.103 --> 00:00:59.352
Well you can see where this is going.

00:00:59.352 --> 00:01:01.086
Approaching my daughter's third birthday,

00:01:01.086 --> 00:01:03.528
my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:07.659
and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ritual?"

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.686
This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture.

00:01:10.686 --> 00:01:14.003
You know, it's remarkable how universal

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:17.119
the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.021
No one's ever refused, and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera.

00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:25.685
Back then, we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.686
It's really become sacred to us.

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:30.317
This one was taken just weeks after 9/11,

00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:34.532
and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day

00:01:34.532 --> 00:01:37.292
in ways a five-year-old could understand.

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:39.899
So these photos are far more than proxies

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.040
for a single moment, or even a specific trip.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.203
They're also ways for us to freeze time

00:01:46.203 --> 00:01:50.119
for one week in October

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.467
and reflect on our times

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:54.619
and how we change from year to year,

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.740
and not just physically, but in every way.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.107
Because while we take the same photo,

00:02:00.107 --> 00:02:02.315
our perspectives change,

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:05.668
and she reaches new milestones,

00:02:05.668 --> 00:02:08.147
and I get to see life through her eyes,

00:02:08.147 --> 00:02:12.872
and how she interacts with and sees everything.

00:02:12.872 --> 00:02:15.635
This very focused time we get to spend together

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:21.122
is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year.

00:02:21.122 --> 00:02:24.183
Recently, on one trip, we were walking,

00:02:24.183 --> 00:02:26.355
and she stops dead in her tracks,

00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:29.826
and she points to a red awning of the doll store

00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:32.250
that she loved when she was little

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.522
on our earlier trips.

00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:37.154
And she describes to me the feeling she felt

00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:40.538
as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot.

00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:43.567
She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:46.228
when she saw that place for the very first time

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:48.900
nine years earlier.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.028
And now what she's looking at in New York

00:02:51.028 --> 00:02:52.952
are colleges,

00:02:52.952 --> 00:02:56.252
because she's determined to go to school in New York.

00:02:56.252 --> 00:02:59.133
And it hit me: One of the most important things

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:03.142
we all make are memories.

00:03:03.142 --> 00:03:06.366
So I want to share the idea of taking an active role

00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:10.299
in consciously creating memories.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.078
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots,

00:03:13.078 --> 00:03:14.732
I'm not in many of the family photos.

00:03:14.732 --> 00:03:17.231
I'm always the one taking the picture.

00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.686
So I want to encourage everyone today

00:03:19.686 --> 00:03:21.785
to get in the shot,

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:24.564
and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask,

00:03:24.564 --> 00:03:26.606
"Will you take our picture?"

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:32.344
Thank you. (Applause)
