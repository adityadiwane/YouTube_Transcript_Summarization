00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I don't know your name. Audience Member: Howard. Howard.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Thom Mayne: Howard? I'm sitting next to Howard. I don't know Howard, obviously,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and he's going, I hope you're not next.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
(Laughter)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Amazing. Amazing performance.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Let me start some place. I'm interested --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I kind of do the same thing, but I don't move my body. (Laughter)

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I work in the mineral world. I work with more or less inert matter.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And I organize it. And, well, it's also a bit different

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
because an architect versus, let's say, a dance company

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
finally is a negotiation between one's private world,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
one's conceptual world, the world of ideas, the world of aspirations,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
of inventions, with the relationship of the exterior world

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and all the limitations, the naysayers.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Because I have to say, for my whole career,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
if there's anything that's been consistent, it's been that you can't do it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
No matter what I've done, what I've tried to do,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
everybody says it can't be done.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
kind of realities that you confront with your ideas.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And to be an architect, somehow you have to negotiate between left and right,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and the outside world, and then make it understood.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I can start any number of places, because this process is also --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I think -- very different from some of the morning sessions,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
which you had such a kind of very clear, such a lineal idea,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
like the last one, say, with Howard,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that I think the creative process in architecture,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the design process, is extremely circuitous. It's labyrinthine.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
is the circuitous line, not the straight line.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And definitely my life has been part of that.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'm going to start with some simple kind of

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
notions of how we organize things.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
But basically, what we do is, we try to give coherence to the world.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
We make physical things, buildings

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that become a part in an accretional process; they make cities.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And those things are the reflection of the processes,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and the time that they are made.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And what I'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and the territories which are useful as generative material.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Because, really, all I'm interested in, always, as an architect,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
is the way things are produced because that's what I do. Right?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And it's not based on an a priori notion.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and saying, "This is what it looks like." In fact, somebody mentioned --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Ewan, maybe it was you in your introduction --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
about this is what architects --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
did somebody say it's what business people come to,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
it's what the corporate world comes to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
when they want to make it look like something at the end of the line? Huh. Wow.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It doesn't work that way for me at all.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I have no interest in that whatsoever.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Architecture is the beginning of something, because it's --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
if you're not involved in first principles,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
if you're not involved in the absolute,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
the beginning of that generative process, it's cake decoration.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And I've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
if anybody's involved in cake decorations --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
it's not what I'm interested in doing. (Laughter)

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And so, in the formation of things, in giving it form,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
in concretizing these things,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
it starts with some notion of how one organizes.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
where a series of forces are brought to bear,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and to understand the nature of the final result of that,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
representing the building itself.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
There's been a continual relationship between inventions,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
which are private, and reality, which has been important to me.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
A project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen 10 years ago,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
which was the modeling of a hippocampus --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
the territory of the brain that records short-term memory --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and the documentation of that, the imaginative and documentation of that

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
observing every kilometer a particular object of desire,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and then placing that within this.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And the notion was that I could make an organization

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
not built on normal coherencies, but built on non-sequiturs, built on randomness.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
as it produces architectural work

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
an accretional notion of the city,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and that led to various ideas of organization.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And then this led to broader ideas of buildings

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that come together through the multiplicity of systems.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And it's not any single system that makes the work.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
It's the relationship -- it's the dynamics between the systems --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
which have the power to transform and invent

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and produce an architecture that is -- that would otherwise not exist.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And those systems could be identified,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and they could be grouped together.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And of course, today, with the technology of the computer

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and with the rapid prototyping, etc., we have the mechanisms

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
to understand and to respond to these systems,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
because that's all we do.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
We're producing spaces that accommodate human activity.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And what I'm interested in is not the styling of that,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And that directly connects to ideas of city-making.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
This is a project that we just finished in Penang

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
for a very, very large city project that came directly out of this process,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And the project -- again, enormous, enormous competition --

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
on the Hudson River and in New York

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
that we were asked to do three years ago, which uses these processes.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And what you're looking at are possibilities that have to do

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
with the generation of the city as one applies a methodology

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
that uses notions of these multiple forces,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
that deals with the enormity of the problem, the complexity of the problem,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
when we're designing cities at larger and larger aggregates.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Because one of the issues today is

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and as the aggregates get larger we require

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And that led us directly to the Olympic Village.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
We won the competition -- what was it, nine months ago?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Again, a direct reflection from using these processes

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
to develop extremely complicated, very large-scale organisms.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And then, also, was working with broad strategies.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
In this case, we only used 15 of the 60 acres of land,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and the 45 acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs, etc.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Its position, of course, in the middle of Manhattan -- it's on Hunter's Point.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And then the broader ideas of city-making

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
start having direct influences on architecture,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
on the elements that make up the broader scheme,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
the buildings themselves, and start guiding us.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that could come from literally any place.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And so I can start this discussion in any number of places,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and I've chosen three or four to talk about.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And it has also to do with an interest in

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the vast kind of territory that architecture touches.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
There's just no place that it doesn't somehow

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
have a connective tissue to.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
This is Jim Dine, and it's the absence of presence, etc.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
It's the clothing, the skin, without the presence of the character.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and made into a very, kind of complex space.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And the idea was the relationship of the space,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
which was made up of the fold of the image,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and the clarity of the image

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and the complexity of the space, which were in dialog.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and how we make things,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And this was the first prototype in Korea,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
as we're dealing with a dynamic envelope,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and then the same characteristic of the fabric.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
It has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And that turned right away into another project.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
This is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Again, it's a very, very simple notion.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
If you look at most buildings,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
what you look at is the building, the facade, and it is the building.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And all of a sudden we're kind of moving away,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and we're separating the skin from the body,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and that's going to lead to broader performance criteria,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
which I'm going to talk about in a minute.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And you're looking at how it drapes over

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and differentiates from the body.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And then, again, the building itself,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
middle of Los Angeles, right across from City Hall.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And as it moves, it takes pieces of the earth with it. It bends up.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
It's part of a sign system,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
which was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
the two-dimension, three-dimension signing, etc.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And then it allows one to penetrate the work itself.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
It's transparent, and it allows you to understand, I think,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
what is always the most interesting thing in any building,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
which is the actual constructional processes that make it.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And it's probably the most intense kind of territory

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
of the work, which is not occupied,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
when it's separated from function,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and this is an area that allows for that.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And then the skin starts transforming into other materials.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
We're using light as a building material in this case.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
We're working with Keith Sonnier in New York,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and we're making this large outside room,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
which is possible in Los Angeles, and which is very much reflective

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
of the urban, the contemporary urban environments

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that you would find in Shibuya or you'd find in Mexico City

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
or Sao Paulo, etc.,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And that was very much part of the notion

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
of the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And, again, all of it promoting transparency.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
that light becomes literally a building material.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Well, that immediately turned into something much broader, and as a scope.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And again, we're looking at an early sketch

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
where I'm understanding now

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And now it turned into something much, much broader as a problem,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and it has to do with performance.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
This will be the first building in the United States that took --

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
well, I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
It's a wrong attitude, actually, because the hybrid is probably more interesting.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
But we took the air conditioning out of the tower.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
There's some air conditioning left in the base,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
but the skin now moves on hydraulics.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
It forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
It adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Huge, huge thing. Half a million dollars a year delta.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
10 of these -- it's just under a million square feet --

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
800 and some thousand square feet --

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
10 of these would power Sausalito -- the delta on this.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And so now what we're looking at, as the projects get larger in scale,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
as they interface with broader problems,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
that they expand the capabilities

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
in terms of their performance.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Well, I could also start here.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
We could talk about the relationship

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Well, our research -- my generation for sure,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
people who were going to school in the late '60s --

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
made very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
looking at architecture within its own territory,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and we were much more affected by film,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
by what was going on in the art world, etc.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
This is, of course, Michael Heizer.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And when I saw this, first an image and then visited,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
it completely changed the way I thought after that point.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And I understood that building really could be

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
the augmentation of the Earth's surface,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And then -- well, he was probably looking at this -- this is Nazca;

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.000
this is 700 years ago -- the most amazing four-kilometer land sculptures.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
They're just totally incredible.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw, how we work.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
This is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona --

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
well, whatever it is, a model, a conceptual, kind of idea.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
in the surface of that Earth.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And there it is, again, as it's starting to get resolved tectonically,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and then there's the school.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And, of course,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
we're interested in participating with education.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I have absolutely no interest in producing a building

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
that just accommodates X, Y and Z function.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
What I'm interested in are how these ideas

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
participate in the educational process of young people.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
It demands some sort of notion of inquiry

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
because it's a system that's developed not sculpturally.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
It's an idea that started from my first discussion.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
It has to do with a broad, consistent logic,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And there's an overt -- at least,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
there's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
that connects to the land in a very different way

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
because I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
as one would understand that.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
that uses some of the same ideas. It uses landscape as a major idea.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Then, again, we're doing the headquarters for NOAA --

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency --

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
outside of Washington in Maryland.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And this is how they see the world.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
They have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and the site's in red.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And what we really want to do -- well, the architects,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
if there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut;

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and what we wanted to do is really build this,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and we wanted them to look down at their satellite,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
how they see their own site, that eight-acre site,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and we wanted nothing left. We wanted it to stay green.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
There's actually three baseball fields on it right now,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and they're going to stay there.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
We put one piece directly north-south,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and it holds the dishes at the ears, right?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And then right below that the processing, and the mission lift,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
and the mission control room, and all the other spaces are underground.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And what you look at is an aircraft carrier

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
that's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
broken up by a series of courts,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
and it's five acres of uninterrupted, horizontal space

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
for their administrative offices.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And then that, in turn, propelled us to look at

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
larger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
becomes a connective tissue.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
The new capital competition for Berlin, four years ago.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And again we just finished the ECB --

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
that became part of a connective tissue of a park,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
which is parallel to the river, and develops ideas of the buildings themselves

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and becomes part of the connective fabric --

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
the social, cultural and the landscape, recreational fabric of the city.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
but something that's only inextricably connected

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
to this city and this place at this time.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
which again used this idea of connecting typology,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
the traditional buildings, and morphology,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
or the relationship of the development of land as an idea,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
into a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
is literally just this augmenting,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
just lifting it up and occupying it,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
and other parts are much more energetic and intense.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And talk about that intensity

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
that have to do with putting a series of systems together,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
and then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
One enters the building as it lifts off the ground,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and it becomes part of the idea.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
And then the skin -- the edges of this --

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
all promote the dynamic, the movement of the building

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
as a series of seismic shifts, geologic shifts. Right?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And it makes for event space and then it breaks in places

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
that allow you to peer into the interior, and those interiors, again,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
are promoting transparency for the workplace,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
which has been a continual interest of ours.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And then, again, in a more, kind of traditional setting,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
this is a graduate student housing in Toronto,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
and it's very much about the relationship of a building

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
as it makes a connective tissue to the city.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
The main idea was the gateway, where it breaks the site,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
and the building occupies both the public space and the private space.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And it's that territory of -- it's this thing.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I visited the site many times, and everybody, kind of --

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
you can see this from two kilometers away; it's an exact center of the street,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
and the whole notion is to engage the public,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
And finally, one of the most interesting projects -- it's a courthouse.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And what I want to talk about -- this is the Supreme Court, of course --

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
and, well, I'm dealing with Michael Hogan, the Chief Justice of Oregon.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
You could not proceed without making this negotiation

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
between one's own values and the relationship

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
of the character you're working with and how he understands the court,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
because I'm showing him, of course, Corbusier at Savoy,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
which is 1928, which is the beginning of modern architecture.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Well, then we get to this image.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And this is where the project started. Because I'm going,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
I'm interested in the phenomenon that's taking place in here.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And really what we're talking about is constructing reality.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And I'm a character that's extremely interested

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
in understanding the nature of that constructed reality

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
because there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Nature in the 19th-century sense, alright?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Nature is only a cultural edifice today, right?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
We construct it and we construct those ideas.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
And then of course, this one, our governor at the moment.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And we spent some time with Conan, believe it or not,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
and then that led us to, kind of, the very differences of our worlds

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
from a legal and an artistic, architectural.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And it forced us to talk about notions of how we work,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
and the dynamics of that, and what other sources of the work is.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And it led us to the project, the courthouse,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
which is absolutely a part of a negotiation

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
You'll find a stair that's the same length as the Supreme Court.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Here's a piano nobile, which is a device used in the Renaissance.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
The courts were made of that. The skin is this series of layers

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
that reflect even rusticated stonework,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
but which were embedded with fragments of the Constitution,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
which were part of the little process,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
all set on a plinth that defined it from the community.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Thank you so much.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
(Applause)
