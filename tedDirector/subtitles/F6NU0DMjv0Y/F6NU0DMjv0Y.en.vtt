00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:15.066
I need to start by telling you a little bit

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.555
about my social life,

00:00:16.555 --> 00:00:19.473
which I know may not seem relevant,

00:00:19.473 --> 00:00:21.220
but it is.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.150
When people meet me at parties

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.342
and they find out that I'm an English professor

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:27.739
who specializes in language,

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.189
they generally have one of two reactions.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.378
One set of people look frightened. (Laughter)

00:00:36.378 --> 00:00:37.971
They often say something like,

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:41.277
"Oh, I'd better be careful what I say.

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:44.495
I'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make."

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:48.553
And then they stop talking. (Laughter)

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:50.950
And they wait for me to go away

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.187
and talk to someone else.

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:55.222
The other set of people,

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.647
their eyes light up,

00:00:57.647 --> 00:00:58.878
and they say,

00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:03.187
"You are just the person I want to talk to."

00:01:03.187 --> 00:01:05.607
And then they tell me about whatever it is

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:08.142
they think is going wrong with the English language.

00:01:08.142 --> 00:01:10.511
(Laughter)

00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:12.828
A couple of weeks ago, I was at a dinner party

00:01:12.828 --> 00:01:15.065
and the man to my right

00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:17.100
started telling me about all the ways

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.381
that the Internet is degrading the English language.

00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:23.620
He brought up Facebook, and he said,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.470
"To defriend? I mean, is that even a real word?"

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.040
I want to pause on that question:

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.826
What makes a word real?

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:38.910
My dinner companion and I both know

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.077
what the verb "defriend" means,

00:01:42.077 --> 00:01:44.777
so when does a new word like "defriend"

00:01:44.777 --> 00:01:46.858
become real?

00:01:46.858 --> 00:01:49.362
Who has the authority to make those kinds

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:52.780
of official decisions about words, anyway?

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.075
Those are the questions I want to talk about today.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:02:00.375
I think most people, when they say a word isn't real,

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:02.236
what they mean is, it doesn't appear

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:03.864
in a standard dictionary.

00:02:03.864 --> 00:02:06.327
That, of course, raises a host of other questions,

00:02:06.327 --> 00:02:11.724
including, who writes dictionaries?

00:02:11.724 --> 00:02:13.048
Before I go any further,

00:02:13.048 --> 00:02:15.490
let me clarify my role in all of this.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.998
I do not write dictionaries.

00:02:17.998 --> 00:02:20.695
I do, however, collect new words

00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:23.750
much the way dictionary editors do,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.573
and the great thing about being a historian

00:02:25.573 --> 00:02:26.640
of the English language

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.276
is that I get to call this "research."

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:32.620
When I teach the history of the English language,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.377
I require that students teach me

00:02:35.377 --> 00:02:38.903
two new slang words before I will begin class.

00:02:38.903 --> 00:02:41.220
Over the years, I have learned

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.454
some great new slang this way,

00:02:44.454 --> 00:02:48.492
including "hangry," which --

00:02:48.492 --> 00:02:52.188
(Applause) â€”

00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:54.535
which is when you are cranky or angry

00:02:54.535 --> 00:02:58.774
because you are hungry,

00:02:58.774 --> 00:03:03.550
and "adorkable,"

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.257
which is when you are adorable

00:03:05.257 --> 00:03:08.278
in kind of a dorky way,

00:03:08.278 --> 00:03:11.471
clearly, terrific words that fill

00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:14.176
important gaps in the English language.

00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:18.389
(Laughter)

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.060
But how real are they

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.279
if we use them primarily as slang

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:27.396
and they don't yet appear in a dictionary?

00:03:27.396 --> 00:03:30.213
With that, let's turn to dictionaries.

00:03:30.213 --> 00:03:32.053
I'm going to do this as a show of hands:

00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:34.387
How many of you still regularly

00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:37.515
refer to a dictionary, either print or online?

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:41.532
Okay, so that looks like most of you.

00:03:41.532 --> 00:03:44.697
Now, a second question. Again, a show of hands:

00:03:44.697 --> 00:03:47.902
How many of you have ever looked to see

00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:50.791
who edited the dictionary you are using?

00:03:54.048 --> 00:03:57.680
Okay, many fewer.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.360
At some level, we know that there are human hands

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.936
behind dictionaries,

00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:07.207
but we're really not sure who those hands belong to.

00:04:07.207 --> 00:04:09.547
I'm actually fascinated by this.

00:04:09.547 --> 00:04:12.020
Even the most critical people out there

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.614
tend not to be very critical about dictionaries,

00:04:14.614 --> 00:04:16.497
not distinguishing among them

00:04:16.497 --> 00:04:18.568
and not asking a whole lot of questions

00:04:18.568 --> 00:04:20.791
about who edited them.

00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:22.414
Just think about the phrase

00:04:22.414 --> 00:04:24.890
"Look it up in the dictionary,"

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.567
which suggests that all dictionaries

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.273
are exactly the same.

00:04:28.273 --> 00:04:30.873
Consider the library here on campus,

00:04:30.873 --> 00:04:32.569
where you go into the reading room,

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.442
and there is a large, unabridged dictionary

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:39.320
up on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.667
lying open so we can go stand before it

00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:43.870
to get answers.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.176
Now, don't get me wrong,

00:04:46.176 --> 00:04:49.381
dictionaries are fantastic resources,

00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:50.930
but they are human

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.211
and they are not timeless.

00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:55.013
I'm struck as a teacher

00:04:55.013 --> 00:04:58.230
that we tell students to critically question

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.964
every text they read, every website they visit,

00:05:01.964 --> 00:05:03.452
except dictionaries,

00:05:03.452 --> 00:05:06.617
which we tend to treat as un-authored,

00:05:06.617 --> 00:05:09.259
as if they came from nowhere to give us answers

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.603
about what words really mean.

00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:17.200
Here's the thing: If you ask dictionary editors,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.358
what they'll tell you

00:05:18.358 --> 00:05:20.672
is they're just trying to keep up with us

00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:22.427
as we change the language.

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:24.912
They're watching what we say and what we write

00:05:24.912 --> 00:05:27.070
and trying to figure out what's going to stick

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.220
and what's not going to stick.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.537
They have to gamble,

00:05:30.537 --> 00:05:32.286
because they want to appear cutting edge

00:05:32.286 --> 00:05:34.942
and catch the words that are going to make it,

00:05:34.942 --> 00:05:37.381
such as LOL,

00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:39.585
but they don't want to appear faddish

00:05:39.585 --> 00:05:42.127
and include the words that aren't going to make it,

00:05:42.127 --> 00:05:43.940
and I think a word that they're watching right now

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.359
is YOLO, you only live once.

00:05:49.317 --> 00:05:51.811
Now I get to hang out with dictionary editors,

00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:53.319
and you might be surprised

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.535
by one of the places where we hang out.

00:05:55.535 --> 00:05:57.672
Every January, we go

00:05:57.672 --> 00:06:00.825
to the American Dialect Society annual meeting,

00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:02.172
where among other things,

00:06:02.172 --> 00:06:05.930
we vote on the word of the year.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.933
There are about 200 or 300 people who come,

00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:11.373
some of the best known
linguists in the United States.

00:06:11.373 --> 00:06:13.231
To give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting,

00:06:13.231 --> 00:06:16.532
it occurs right before happy hour.

00:06:16.532 --> 00:06:18.608
Anyone who comes can vote.

00:06:18.608 --> 00:06:19.920
The most important rule is

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.049
that you can vote with only one hand.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:26.513
In the past, some of the winners have been

00:06:26.513 --> 00:06:28.998
"tweet" in 2009

00:06:28.998 --> 00:06:32.403
and "hashtag" in 2012.

00:06:32.403 --> 00:06:35.462
"Chad" was the word of the year in the year 2000,

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:39.282
because who knew what a chad was before 2000,

00:06:39.282 --> 00:06:43.696
and "WMD" in 2002.

00:06:43.696 --> 00:06:46.497
Now, we have other categories in which we vote too,

00:06:46.497 --> 00:06:48.090
and my favorite category

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.474
is most creative word of the year.

00:06:50.474 --> 00:06:53.224
Past winners in this category have included

00:06:53.224 --> 00:06:56.277
"recombobulation area,"

00:06:56.277 --> 00:07:00.080
which is at the Milwaukee Airport after security,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.640
where you can recombobulate.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.124
(Laughter)

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:05.643
You can put your belt back on,

00:07:05.643 --> 00:07:08.104
put your computer back in your bag.

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:13.621
And then my all-time favorite word at this vote,

00:07:13.621 --> 00:07:15.847
which is "multi-slacking."

00:07:15.847 --> 00:07:18.350
(Laughter)

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.633
And multi-slacking is the act

00:07:20.633 --> 00:07:23.501
of having multiple windows up on your screen

00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:24.902
so it looks like you're working

00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:26.996
when you're actually goofing around on the web.

00:07:26.996 --> 00:07:31.825
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:36.989
Will all of these words stick? Absolutely not.

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:39.888
And we have made some questionable choices,

00:07:39.888 --> 00:07:41.565
for example in 2006

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:43.604
when the word of the year was "Plutoed,"

00:07:43.604 --> 00:07:45.596
to mean demoted.

00:07:45.596 --> 00:07:49.351
(Laughter)

00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:52.955
But some of the past winners

00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:55.870
now seem completely unremarkable,

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.388
such as "app"

00:07:57.388 --> 00:07:59.401
and "e" as a prefix,

00:07:59.401 --> 00:08:02.360
and "google" as a verb.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.427
Now, a few weeks before our vote,

00:08:06.427 --> 00:08:08.208
Lake Superior State University

00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:12.987
issues its list of banished words for the year.

00:08:12.987 --> 00:08:14.920
What is striking about this

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.691
is that there's actually often quite a lot of overlap

00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:20.528
between their list and the list that we are considering

00:08:20.528 --> 00:08:22.778
for words of the year,

00:08:22.778 --> 00:08:26.870
and this is because we're noticing the same thing.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.900
We're noticing words that are coming into prominence.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.053
It's really a question of attitude.

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:35.720
Are you bothered by language
fads and language change,

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.130
or do you find it fun, interesting,

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.484
something worthy of study

00:08:40.484 --> 00:08:43.369
as part of a living language?

00:08:43.369 --> 00:08:45.525
The list by Lake Superior State University

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.170
continues a fairly long tradition in English

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.443
of complaints about new words.

00:08:50.443 --> 00:08:54.795
So here is Dean Henry Alford in 1875,

00:08:54.795 --> 00:08:57.041
who was very concerned that "desirability"

00:08:57.041 --> 00:08:59.490
is really a terrible word.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.224
In 1760, Benjamin Franklin

00:09:02.224 --> 00:09:03.680
wrote a letter to David Hume

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.483
giving up the word "colonize" as bad.

00:09:07.483 --> 00:09:09.682
Over the years, we've also seen worries

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:11.572
about new pronunciations.

00:09:11.572 --> 00:09:14.620
Here is Samuel Rogers in 1855

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.219
who is concerned about some
fashionable pronunciations

00:09:17.219 --> 00:09:19.226
that he finds offensive,

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:22.714
and he says "as if contemplate were not bad enough,

00:09:22.714 --> 00:09:25.132
balcony makes me sick."

00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:28.528
(Laughter)

00:09:28.528 --> 00:09:30.878
The word is borrowed in from Italian

00:09:30.878 --> 00:09:34.418
and it was pronounced bal-COE-nee.

00:09:34.418 --> 00:09:37.361
These complaints now strike us as quaint,

00:09:37.361 --> 00:09:42.306
if not downright adorkable -- (Laughter) --

00:09:42.306 --> 00:09:45.040
but here's the thing:

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.413
we still get quite worked up about language change.

00:09:49.413 --> 00:09:51.475
I have an entire file in my office

00:09:51.475 --> 00:09:54.537
of newspaper articles

00:09:54.537 --> 00:09:57.230
which express concern about illegitimate words

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.109
that should not have been included in the dictionary,

00:09:59.109 --> 00:10:00.557
including "LOL"

00:10:00.557 --> 00:10:02.627
when it got into the Oxford English Dictionary

00:10:02.627 --> 00:10:04.402
and "defriend"

00:10:04.402 --> 00:10:07.174
when it got into the Oxford American Dictionary.

00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:09.391
I also have articles expressing concern

00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:12.260
about "invite" as a noun,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.216
"impact" as a verb,

00:10:14.216 --> 00:10:17.187
because only teeth can be impacted,

00:10:17.187 --> 00:10:20.162
and "incentivize" is described

00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:24.673
as "boorish, bureaucratic misspeak."

00:10:24.673 --> 00:10:26.634
Now, it's not that dictionary editors

00:10:26.634 --> 00:10:29.325
ignore these kinds of attitudes about language.

00:10:29.325 --> 00:10:31.880
They try to provide us some guidance about words

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.150
that are considered slang or informal

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.293
or offensive, often through usage labels,

00:10:37.293 --> 00:10:38.983
but they're in something of a bind,

00:10:38.983 --> 00:10:42.635
because they're trying to describe what we do,

00:10:42.635 --> 00:10:44.964
and they know that we often go to dictionaries

00:10:44.964 --> 00:10:47.732
to get information about how we should use a word

00:10:47.732 --> 00:10:49.640
well or appropriately.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.664
In response, the American Heritage Dictionaries

00:10:52.664 --> 00:10:54.805
include usage notes.

00:10:54.805 --> 00:10:56.922
Usage notes tend to occur with words

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:58.245
that are troublesome in one way,

00:10:58.245 --> 00:11:01.110
and one of the ways that they can be troublesome

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.043
is that they're changing meaning.

00:11:03.043 --> 00:11:06.469
Now usage notes involve very human decisions,

00:11:06.469 --> 00:11:08.528
and I think, as dictionary users,

00:11:08.528 --> 00:11:10.770
we're often not as aware of those human decisions

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.869
as we should be.

00:11:11.869 --> 00:11:12.993
To show you what I mean,

00:11:12.993 --> 00:11:15.710
we'll look at an example, but before we do,

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.692
I want to explain what the dictionary editors

00:11:17.692 --> 00:11:20.990
are trying to deal with in this usage note.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.664
Think about the word "peruse"

00:11:23.664 --> 00:11:27.302
and how you use that word.

00:11:27.302 --> 00:11:29.838
I would guess many of you are thinking

00:11:29.838 --> 00:11:34.375
of skim, scan, reading quickly.

00:11:34.375 --> 00:11:37.210
Some of you may even have some walking involved,

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.456
because you're perusing grocery store shelves,

00:11:39.456 --> 00:11:41.127
or something like that.

00:11:41.127 --> 00:11:43.611
You might be surprised to learn

00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:45.480
that if you look in most standard dictionaries,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.253
the first definition will be to read carefully,

00:11:48.253 --> 00:11:50.697
or pore over.

00:11:50.697 --> 00:11:53.556
American Heritage has that as the first definition.

00:11:53.556 --> 00:11:56.521
They then have, as the second definition, skim,

00:11:56.521 --> 00:12:00.316
and next to that, they say "usage problem."

00:12:00.316 --> 00:12:02.226
(Laughter)

00:12:02.226 --> 00:12:04.314
And then they include a usage note,

00:12:04.314 --> 00:12:06.191
which is worth looking at.

00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:08.102
So here's the usage note:

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:10.459
"Peruse has long meant 'to read thoroughly'...

00:12:10.459 --> 00:12:12.226
But the word is often used more loosely,

00:12:12.226 --> 00:12:14.386
to mean simply 'to read.'...

00:12:14.386 --> 00:12:17.315
Further extension of the word
to mean 'to glance over, skim,'

00:12:17.315 --> 00:12:19.771
has traditionally been considered an error,

00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:22.174
but our ballot results suggest that it is becoming

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:23.870
somewhat more acceptable.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.269
When asked about the sentence,

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:28.000
'I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly,'

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.075
66 percent of the [Usage] Panel

00:12:30.075 --> 00:12:32.422
found it unacceptable in 1988,

00:12:32.422 --> 00:12:34.529
58 percent in 1999,

00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:38.397
and 48 percent in 2011."

00:12:38.397 --> 00:12:40.358
Ah, the Usage Panel,

00:12:40.358 --> 00:12:42.968
that trusted body of language authorities

00:12:42.968 --> 00:12:45.820
who is getting more lenient about this.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.890
Now, what I hope you're thinking right now is,

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.885
"Wait, who's on the Usage Panel?

00:12:51.885 --> 00:12:54.997
And what should I do with their pronouncements?"

00:12:54.997 --> 00:12:56.960
If you look in the front matter

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.068
of American Heritage Dictionaries,

00:12:58.068 --> 00:12:59.643
you can actually find the names

00:12:59.643 --> 00:13:01.212
of the people on the Usage Panel.

00:13:01.212 --> 00:13:03.244
But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries?

00:13:03.244 --> 00:13:06.291
There are about 200 people on the Usage Panel.

00:13:06.291 --> 00:13:08.668
They include academicians,

00:13:08.668 --> 00:13:10.345
journalists, creative writers.

00:13:10.345 --> 00:13:12.437
There's a Supreme Court justice on it

00:13:12.437 --> 00:13:14.336
and a few linguists.

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:19.168
As of 2005, the list includes me.

00:13:19.168 --> 00:13:22.980
(Applause)

00:13:23.342 --> 00:13:26.710
Here's what we can do for you.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.070
We can give you a sense

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.122
of the range of opinions about contested usage.

00:13:32.122 --> 00:13:35.479
That is and should be the extent of our authority.

00:13:35.479 --> 00:13:38.890
We are not a language academy.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.837
About once a year, I get a ballot

00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:44.869
that asks me about whether new uses,

00:13:44.869 --> 00:13:48.207
new pronunciations, new meanings, are acceptable.

00:13:48.207 --> 00:13:51.099
Now here's what I do to fill out the ballot.

00:13:51.099 --> 00:13:54.607
I listen to what other people are saying and writing.

00:13:54.607 --> 00:13:56.851
I do not listen to my own likes

00:13:56.851 --> 00:14:00.060
and dislikes about the English language.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.529
I will be honest with you:

00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:04.478
I do not like the word "impactful,"

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:06.480
but that is neither here nor there

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.719
in terms of whether "impactful"
is becoming common usage

00:14:09.719 --> 00:14:12.970
and becoming more acceptable in written prose.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.018
So to be responsible,

00:14:14.018 --> 00:14:16.546
what I do is go look at usage,

00:14:16.546 --> 00:14:18.382
which often involves going to look

00:14:18.382 --> 00:14:21.077
at online databases such as Google Books.

00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:23.897
Well, if you look for "impactful" in Google Books,

00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:27.103
here is what you find.

00:14:27.103 --> 00:14:29.344
Well, it sure looks like "impactful"

00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:31.074
is proving useful

00:14:31.074 --> 00:14:32.703
for a certain number of writers,

00:14:32.703 --> 00:14:34.303
and has become more and more useful

00:14:34.303 --> 00:14:36.262
over the last 20 years.

00:14:36.262 --> 00:14:38.415
Now, there are going to be changes

00:14:38.415 --> 00:14:41.049
that all of us don't like in the language.

00:14:41.049 --> 00:14:43.233
There are going to be changes where you think,

00:14:43.233 --> 00:14:44.220
"Really?

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.905
Does the language have to change that way?"

00:14:47.905 --> 00:14:49.588
What I'm saying is,

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:51.310
we should be less quick

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.101
to decide that that change is terrible,

00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:56.815
we should be less quick to impose

00:14:56.815 --> 00:15:00.116
our likes and dislikes about words on other people,

00:15:00.116 --> 00:15:03.030
and we should be entirely reluctant

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.774
to think that the English language is in trouble.

00:15:05.774 --> 00:15:09.970
It's not. It is rich and vibrant and filled

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.980
with the creativity of the speakers who speak it.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.598
In retrospect, we think it's fascinating

00:15:15.598 --> 00:15:18.976
that the word "nice" used to mean silly,

00:15:18.976 --> 00:15:20.660
and that the word "decimate"

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.165
used to mean to kill one in every 10.

00:15:24.165 --> 00:15:28.358
(Laughter)

00:15:29.162 --> 00:15:34.255
We think that Ben Franklin was being silly

00:15:34.255 --> 00:15:36.904
to worry about "notice" as a verb.

00:15:36.904 --> 00:15:38.367
Well, you know what?

00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:41.067
We're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years

00:15:41.067 --> 00:15:43.364
for worrying about "impact" as a verb

00:15:43.364 --> 00:15:46.176
and "invite" as a noun.

00:15:46.176 --> 00:15:48.416
The language is not going to change so fast

00:15:48.416 --> 00:15:50.313
that we can't keep up.

00:15:50.313 --> 00:15:52.596
Language just doesn't work that way.

00:15:52.596 --> 00:15:54.209
I hope that what you can do

00:15:54.209 --> 00:15:57.038
is find language change not worrisome

00:15:57.038 --> 00:15:59.076
but fun and fascinating,

00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:02.085
just the way dictionary editors do.

00:16:02.085 --> 00:16:04.047
I hope you can enjoy being part

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:09.051
of the creativity that is continually remaking

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:12.327
our language and keeping it robust.

00:16:12.327 --> 00:16:15.247
So how does a word get into a dictionary?

00:16:15.247 --> 00:16:17.716
It gets in because we use it

00:16:17.716 --> 00:16:19.340
and we keep using it,

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.575
and dictionary editors are paying attention to us.

00:16:23.575 --> 00:16:26.695
If you're thinking, "But that lets all of us decide

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:28.444
what words mean,"

00:16:28.444 --> 00:16:32.495
I would say, "Yes it does,

00:16:32.495 --> 00:16:34.847
and it always has."

00:16:34.847 --> 00:16:38.774
Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource,

00:16:38.774 --> 00:16:42.270
but there is no objective
dictionary authority out there

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:46.043
that is the final arbiter about what words mean.

00:16:46.043 --> 00:16:48.556
If a community of speakers is using a word

00:16:48.556 --> 00:16:52.152
and knows what it means, it's real.

00:16:52.152 --> 00:16:53.520
That word might be slangy,

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.162
that word might be informal,

00:16:55.162 --> 00:16:57.067
that word might be a word that you think

00:16:57.067 --> 00:16:59.524
is illogical or unnecessary,

00:16:59.524 --> 00:17:02.075
but that word that we're using,

00:17:02.075 --> 00:17:04.433
that word is real.

00:17:04.433 --> 00:17:06.774
Thank you.

00:17:06.774 --> 00:17:08.453
(Applause)
