00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:14.505
We have a global health challenge

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:16.197
in our hands today,

00:00:16.197 --> 00:00:19.257
and that is that the way we currently

00:00:19.257 --> 00:00:22.182
discover and develop new drugs

00:00:22.182 --> 00:00:26.360
is too costly, takes far too long,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.074
and it fails more often than it succeeds.

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:33.451
It really just isn't working, and that means

00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:36.498
that patients that badly need new therapies

00:00:36.498 --> 00:00:38.209
are not getting them,

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:41.707
and diseases are going untreated.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:44.790
We seem to be spending more and more money.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.886
So for every billion dollars we spend in R&amp;D,

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:52.715
we're getting less drugs approved into the market.

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:55.932
More money, less drugs. Hmm.

00:00:55.932 --> 00:00:57.852
So what's going on here?

00:00:57.852 --> 00:01:00.447
Well, there's a multitude of factors at play,

00:01:00.447 --> 00:01:02.468
but I think one of the key factors

00:01:02.468 --> 00:01:04.865
is that the tools that we currently have

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:08.948
available to test whether a drug is going to work,

00:01:08.948 --> 00:01:10.337
whether it has efficacy,

00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:12.103
or whether it's going to be safe

00:01:12.103 --> 00:01:15.655
before we get it into human clinical trials,

00:01:15.655 --> 00:01:17.806
are failing us. They're not predicting

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:21.034
what's going to happen in humans.

00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:23.757
And we have two main tools available

00:01:23.757 --> 00:01:25.771
at our disposal.

00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.812
They are cells in dishes and animal testing.

00:01:29.812 --> 00:01:33.132
Now let's talk about the first one, cells in dishes.

00:01:33.132 --> 00:01:36.285
So, cells are happily functioning in our bodies.

00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:38.340
We take them and rip them out

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.289
of their native environment,
throw them in one of these dishes,

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:42.874
and expect them to work.

00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:45.067
Guess what. They don't.

00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:46.729
They don't like that environment

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.361
because it's nothing like

00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:51.037
what they have in the body.

00:01:51.037 --> 00:01:53.108
What about animal testing?

00:01:53.108 --> 00:01:55.993
Well, animals do and can provide

00:01:55.993 --> 00:01:58.255
extremely useful information.

00:01:58.255 --> 00:01:59.964
They teach us about what happens

00:01:59.964 --> 00:02:02.293
in the complex organism.

00:02:02.293 --> 00:02:05.301
We learn more about the biology itself.

00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:08.199
However, more often than not,

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:12.415
animal models fail to predict
what will happen in humans

00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:15.601
when they're treated with a particular drug.

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.980
So we need better tools.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.733
We need human cells,

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:22.483
but we need to find a way to keep them happy

00:02:22.483 --> 00:02:24.074
outside the body.

00:02:24.074 --> 00:02:26.980
Our bodies are dynamic environments.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.820
We're in constant motion.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.011
Our cells experience that.

00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:33.820
They're in dynamic environments in our body.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.575
They're under constant mechanical forces.

00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:39.031
So if we want to make cells happy

00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:40.460
outside our bodies,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.986
we need to become cell architects.

00:02:42.986 --> 00:02:47.330
We need to design, build and engineer

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.561
a home away from home for the cells.

00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:52.235
And at the Wyss Institute,

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:54.173
we've done just that.

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:57.197
We call it an organ-on-a-chip.

00:02:57.197 --> 00:02:58.988
And I have one right here.

00:02:58.988 --> 00:03:01.803
It's beautiful, isn't it?
But it's pretty incredible.

00:03:01.803 --> 00:03:06.303
Right here in my hand is a breathing, living

00:03:06.303 --> 00:03:08.961
human lung on a chip.

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:11.089
And it's not just beautiful.

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:13.529
It can do a tremendous amount of things.

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:17.308
We have living cells in that little chip,

00:03:17.308 --> 00:03:19.858
cells that are in a dynamic environment

00:03:19.858 --> 00:03:22.939
interacting with different cell types.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.578
There's been many people

00:03:24.578 --> 00:03:26.439
trying to grow cells in the lab.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.595
They've tried many different approaches.

00:03:29.595 --> 00:03:32.222
They've even tried to grow
little mini-organs in the lab.

00:03:32.222 --> 00:03:33.771
We're not trying to do that here.

00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:35.897
We're simply trying to recreate

00:03:35.897 --> 00:03:37.474
in this tiny chip

00:03:37.474 --> 00:03:40.491
the smallest functional unit

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:43.045
that represents the biochemistry,

00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:46.169
the function and the mechanical strain

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.685
that the cells experience in our bodies.

00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:52.717
So how does it work? Let me show you.

00:03:52.717 --> 00:03:55.351
We use techniques from the computer chip

00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:56.984
manufacturing industry

00:03:56.984 --> 00:03:59.181
to make these structures at a scale

00:03:59.181 --> 00:04:02.077
relevant to both the cells and their environment.

00:04:02.077 --> 00:04:04.141
We have three fluidic channels.

00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:07.853
In the center, we have a porous, flexible membrane

00:04:07.853 --> 00:04:09.916
on which we can add human cells

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.260
from, say, our lungs,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.747
and then underneath, they had capillary cells,

00:04:13.747 --> 00:04:15.535
the cells in our blood vessels.

00:04:15.535 --> 00:04:19.855
And we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip

00:04:19.855 --> 00:04:22.684
that stretch and contract the membrane,

00:04:22.684 --> 00:04:25.781
so the cells experience the same mechanical forces

00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:28.714
that they did when we breathe.

00:04:28.714 --> 00:04:31.874
And they experience them how they did in the body.

00:04:31.874 --> 00:04:34.274
There's air flowing through the top channel,

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.623
and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients

00:04:37.623 --> 00:04:40.462
through the blood channel.

00:04:40.462 --> 00:04:42.834
Now the chip is really beautiful,

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:44.931
but what can we do with it?

00:04:44.931 --> 00:04:47.255
We can get incredible functionality

00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:49.006
inside these little chips.

00:04:49.006 --> 00:04:50.512
Let me show you.

00:04:50.512 --> 00:04:53.143
We could, for example, mimic infection,

00:04:53.143 --> 00:04:56.679
where we add bacterial cells into the lung.

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:59.611
then we can add human white blood cells.

00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:02.202
White blood cells are our body's defense

00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:03.570
against bacterial invaders,

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.739
and when they sense this
inflammation due to infection,

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:09.596
they will enter from the blood into the lung

00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:11.511
and engulf the bacteria.

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:13.759
Well now you're going to see this happening

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.069
live in an actual human lung on a chip.

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.612
We've labeled the white blood cells
so you can see them flowing through,

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.773
and when they detect that infection,

00:05:22.773 --> 00:05:24.170
they begin to stick.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.057
They stick, and then they try to go into the lung

00:05:28.057 --> 00:05:29.838
side from blood channel.

00:05:29.838 --> 00:05:33.527
And you can see here, we can actually visualize

00:05:33.527 --> 00:05:37.286
a single white blood cell.

00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:39.542
It sticks, it wiggles its way through

00:05:39.542 --> 00:05:41.857
between the cell layers, through the pore,

00:05:41.857 --> 00:05:44.278
comes out on the other side of the membrane,

00:05:44.278 --> 00:05:47.713
and right there, it's going to engulf the bacteria

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:49.362
labeled in green.

00:05:49.362 --> 00:05:52.366
In that tiny chip, you just witnessed

00:05:52.366 --> 00:05:55.547
one of the most fundamental responses

00:05:55.547 --> 00:05:57.504
our body has to an infection.

00:05:57.504 --> 00:06:01.274
It's the way we respond to -- an immune response.

00:06:01.274 --> 00:06:03.675
It's pretty exciting.

00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:06.018
Now I want to share this picture with you,

00:06:06.018 --> 00:06:08.656
not just because it's so beautiful,

00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:11.992
but because it tells us an enormous
amount of information

00:06:11.992 --> 00:06:14.589
about what the cells are doing within the chips.

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:16.848
It tells us that these cells

00:06:16.848 --> 00:06:19.159
from the small airways in our lungs,

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:20.910
actually have these hairlike structures

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.918
that you would expect to see in the lung.

00:06:22.918 --> 00:06:24.383
These structures are called cilia,

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:27.293
and they actually move the mucus out of the lung.

00:06:27.293 --> 00:06:28.832
Yeah. Mucus. Yuck.

00:06:28.832 --> 00:06:31.272
But mucus is actually very important.

00:06:31.272 --> 00:06:33.853
Mucus traps particulates, viruses,

00:06:33.853 --> 00:06:35.312
potential allergens,

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:36.913
and these little cilia move

00:06:36.913 --> 00:06:39.163
and clear the mucus out.

00:06:39.163 --> 00:06:41.075
When they get damaged, say,

00:06:41.075 --> 00:06:43.494
by cigarette smoke for example,

00:06:43.494 --> 00:06:46.302
they don't work properly,
and they can't clear that mucus out.

00:06:46.302 --> 00:06:50.119
And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis.

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:52.766
Cilia and the clearance of mucus

00:06:52.766 --> 00:06:57.227
are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis.

00:06:57.227 --> 00:07:00.777
But now, with the functionality
that we get in these chips,

00:07:00.777 --> 00:07:02.601
we can begin to look

00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:05.114
for potential new treatments.

00:07:05.114 --> 00:07:07.066
We didn't stop with the lung on a chip.

00:07:07.066 --> 00:07:08.950
We have a gut on a chip.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.980
You can see one right here.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.206
And we've put intestinal human cells

00:07:14.206 --> 00:07:16.111
in a gut on a chip,

00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:18.948
and they're under constant peristaltic motion,

00:07:18.948 --> 00:07:22.139
this trickling flow through the cells,

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.697
and we can mimic many of the functions

00:07:24.697 --> 00:07:26.960
that you actually would expect to see

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.653
in the human intestine.

00:07:28.653 --> 00:07:32.444
Now we can begin to create models of diseases

00:07:32.444 --> 00:07:34.854
such as irritable bowel syndrome.

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:36.936
This is a disease that affects

00:07:36.936 --> 00:07:38.847
a large number of individuals.

00:07:38.847 --> 00:07:40.621
It's really debilitating,

00:07:40.621 --> 00:07:44.563
and there aren't really many good treatments for it.

00:07:44.563 --> 00:07:46.865
Now we have a whole pipeline

00:07:46.865 --> 00:07:49.144
of different organ chips

00:07:49.144 --> 00:07:52.876
that we are currently working on in our labs.

00:07:52.876 --> 00:07:56.295
Now, the true power of this technology, however,

00:07:56.295 --> 00:07:58.420
really comes from the fact

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.965
that we can fluidically link them.

00:08:00.965 --> 00:08:02.912
There's fluid flowing across these cells,

00:08:02.912 --> 00:08:04.991
so we can begin to interconnect

00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:07.853
multiple different chips together

00:08:07.853 --> 00:08:12.066
to form what we call a virtual human on a chip.

00:08:12.066 --> 00:08:15.075
Now we're really getting excited.

00:08:15.075 --> 00:08:19.170
We're not going to ever recreate 
a whole human in these chips,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.339
but what our goal is is to be able to recreate

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:25.352
sufficient functionality

00:08:25.352 --> 00:08:27.712
so that we can make better predictions

00:08:27.712 --> 00:08:29.926
of what's going to happen in humans.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.850
For example, now we can begin to explore

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.284
what happens when we put
a drug like an aerosol drug.

00:08:36.284 --> 00:08:39.270
Those of you like me who have asthma,
when you take your inhaler,

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.196
we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs,

00:08:42.196 --> 00:08:43.822
how it enters the body,

00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:45.576
how it might affect, say, your heart.

00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:47.484
Does it change the beating of your heart?

00:08:47.484 --> 00:08:49.125
Does it have a toxicity?

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:51.133
Does it get cleared by the liver?

00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:53.285
Is it metabolized in the liver?

00:08:53.285 --> 00:08:55.176
Is it excreted in your kidneys?

00:08:55.176 --> 00:08:57.388
We can begin to study the dynamic

00:08:57.388 --> 00:09:00.013
response of the body to a drug.

00:09:00.028 --> 00:09:01.947
This could really revolutionize

00:09:01.947 --> 00:09:03.596
and be a game changer

00:09:03.596 --> 00:09:06.534
for not only the pharmaceutical industry,

00:09:06.534 --> 00:09:08.907
but a whole host of different industries,

00:09:08.907 --> 00:09:11.307
including the cosmetics industry.

00:09:11.307 --> 00:09:14.189
We can potentially use the skin on a chip

00:09:14.189 --> 00:09:16.150
that we're currently developing in the lab

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.704
to test whether the ingredients in those products

00:09:18.704 --> 00:09:21.987
that you're using are actually 
safe to put on your skin

00:09:21.987 --> 00:09:24.676
without the need for animal testing.

00:09:24.676 --> 00:09:26.620
We could test the safety

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.873
of chemicals that we are exposed to

00:09:28.873 --> 00:09:30.787
on a daily basis in our environment,

00:09:30.787 --> 00:09:34.518
such as chemicals in regular household cleaners.

00:09:34.518 --> 00:09:37.720
We could also use the organs on chips

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.499
for applications in bioterrorism

00:09:40.499 --> 00:09:43.070
or radiation exposure.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.420
We could use them to learn more about

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.464
diseases such as ebola

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:53.356
or other deadly diseases such as SARS.

00:09:53.356 --> 00:09:55.194
Organs on chips could also change

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:58.568
the way we do clinical trials in the future.

00:09:58.568 --> 00:10:01.155
Right now, the average participant

00:10:01.155 --> 00:10:04.525
in a clinical trial is that: average.

00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:07.851
Tends to be middle aged, tends to be female.

00:10:07.851 --> 00:10:10.323
You won't find many clinical trials

00:10:10.323 --> 00:10:11.838
in which children are involved,

00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:15.385
yet every day, we give children medications,

00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:19.131
and the only safety data we have on that drug

00:10:19.131 --> 00:10:22.205
is one that we obtained from adults.

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:23.999
Children are not adults.

00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:27.132
They may not respond in the same way adults do.

00:10:27.132 --> 00:10:29.544
There are other things like genetic differences

00:10:29.544 --> 00:10:30.977
in populations

00:10:30.977 --> 00:10:34.083
that may lead to at-risk populations

00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:37.520
that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.909
Now imagine if we could take cells
from all those different populations,

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:42.827
put them on chips,

00:10:42.827 --> 00:10:44.791
and create populations on a chip.

00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:46.629
This could really change the way

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:48.698
we do clinical trials.

00:10:48.698 --> 00:10:51.530
And this is the team and the people
that are doing this.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.787
We have engineers, we have cell biologists,

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:58.561
we have clinicians, all working together.

00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:00.487
We're really seeing something quite incredible

00:11:00.487 --> 00:11:02.092
at the Wyss Institute.

00:11:02.092 --> 00:11:04.263
It's really a convergence of disciplines,

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:07.983
where biology is influencing the way we design,

00:11:07.983 --> 00:11:10.645
the way we engineer, the way we build.

00:11:10.645 --> 00:11:12.048
It's pretty exciting.

00:11:12.048 --> 00:11:15.612
We're establishing important industry collaborations

00:11:15.612 --> 00:11:18.985
such as the one we have with a company

00:11:18.985 --> 00:11:22.584
that has expertise in large-scale
digital manufacturing.

00:11:22.584 --> 00:11:24.603
They're going to help us make,

00:11:24.603 --> 00:11:26.129
instead of one of these,

00:11:26.129 --> 00:11:27.712
millions of these chips,

00:11:27.712 --> 00:11:29.381
so that we can get them into the hands

00:11:29.381 --> 00:11:32.270
of as many researchers as possible.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.486
And this is key to the potential of that technology.

00:11:36.486 --> 00:11:39.023
Now let me show you our instrument.

00:11:39.023 --> 00:11:41.012
This is an instrument that our engineers

00:11:41.012 --> 00:11:43.630
are actually prototyping right now in the lab,

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.939
and this instrument is going to give us

00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:48.398
the engineering controls that we're going to require

00:11:48.398 --> 00:11:52.566
in order to link 10 or more organ chips together.

00:11:52.566 --> 00:11:54.795
It does something else that's very important.

00:11:54.795 --> 00:11:57.639
It creates an easy user interface.

00:11:57.639 --> 00:12:00.629
So a cell biologist like me can come in,

00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:02.637
take a chip, put it in a cartridge

00:12:02.637 --> 00:12:04.569
like the prototype you see there,

00:12:04.569 --> 00:12:06.640
put the cartridge into the machine

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.128
just like you would a C.D.,

00:12:08.128 --> 00:12:09.260
and away you go.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.009
Plug and play. Easy.

00:12:12.009 --> 00:12:14.523
Now, let's imagine a little bit

00:12:14.523 --> 00:12:15.902
what the future might look like

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.315
if I could take your stem cells

00:12:18.315 --> 00:12:19.755
and put them on a chip,

00:12:19.755 --> 00:12:22.974
or your stem cells and put them on a chip.

00:12:22.974 --> 00:12:26.475
It would be a personalized chip just for you.

00:12:26.475 --> 00:12:29.683
Now all of us in here are individuals,

00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:32.521
and those individual differences mean

00:12:32.521 --> 00:12:34.963
that we could react very differently

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:39.210
and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:43.778
I myself, a couple of years back,
had a really bad headache,

00:12:43.778 --> 00:12:46.191
just couldn't shake it, thought, 
"Well, I'll try something different."

00:12:46.191 --> 00:12:48.326
I took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later,

00:12:48.326 --> 00:12:50.206
I was on my way to the emergency room

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:52.099
with a full-blown asthma attack.

00:12:52.099 --> 00:12:53.929
Now, obviously it wasn't fatal,

00:12:53.929 --> 00:12:57.102
but unfortunately, some of these

00:12:57.102 --> 00:13:00.711
adverse drug reactions can be fatal.

00:13:00.711 --> 00:13:02.652
So how do we prevent them?

00:13:02.652 --> 00:13:05.232
Well, we could imagine one day

00:13:05.232 --> 00:13:07.575
having Geraldine on a chip,

00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:09.324
having Danielle on a chip,

00:13:09.324 --> 00:13:10.797
having you on a chip.

00:13:10.797 --> 00:13:13.185
Personalized medicine. Thank you.

00:13:13.185 --> 00:13:17.339
(Applause)
