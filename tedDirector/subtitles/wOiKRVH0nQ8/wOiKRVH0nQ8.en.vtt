00:00:16.228 --> 00:00:19.521
I moved to Boston
10 years ago from Chicago,

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:22.140
with an interest in cancer
and in chemistry.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.928
You might know that chemistry
is the science of making molecules

00:00:25.952 --> 00:00:27.268
or, to my taste,

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:28.923
new drugs for cancer.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.236
And you might also know that,
for science and medicine,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.668
Boston is a bit of a candy store.

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:40.390
You can't roll a stop sign in Cambridge
without hitting a graduate student.

00:00:40.414 --> 00:00:42.589
The bar is called the Miracle of Science.

00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:45.855
The billboards say "Lab Space Available."

00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:48.815
And it's fair to say
that in these 10 years,

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.146
we've witnessed absolutely the start
of a scientific revolution --

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.649
that of genome medicine.

00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:57.765
We know more about the patients
that enter our clinic now

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:58.948
than ever before.

00:00:58.972 --> 00:01:01.196
And we're able, finally,
to answer the question

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.584
that's been so pressing for so many years:

00:01:03.608 --> 00:01:05.564
Why do I have cancer?

00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:08.796
This information
is also pretty staggering.

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:12.308
You might know that, so far,
in just the dawn of this revolution,

00:01:12.332 --> 00:01:16.058
we know that there are perhaps
40,000 unique mutations

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:18.693
affecting more than 10,000 genes,

00:01:18.717 --> 00:01:22.080
and that there are 500 of these genes
that are bona-fide drivers,

00:01:22.104 --> 00:01:24.000
causes of cancer.

00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:26.289
Yet comparatively,

00:01:26.313 --> 00:01:29.075
we have about a dozen
targeted medications.

00:01:29.972 --> 00:01:32.234
And this inadequacy of cancer medicine

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:36.368
really hit home when my father
was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.871
We didn't fly him to Boston.

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:41.426
We didn't sequence his genome.

00:01:41.807 --> 00:01:44.949
It's been known for decades
what causes this malignancy.

00:01:46.363 --> 00:01:50.410
It's three proteins: ras, myc, p53.

00:01:50.937 --> 00:01:53.635
This is old information
we've known since about the 80s,

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.579
yet there's no medicine I can prescribe

00:01:55.603 --> 00:01:59.166
to a patient with this
or any of the numerous solid tumors

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.882
caused by these three ...

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:04.150
Horsemen of the Apocalypse that is cancer.

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.975
There's no ras, no myc, no p53 drug.

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:09.610
And you might fairly ask: Why is that?

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.142
And the very unsatisfying
yet scientific answer is:

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:14.324
it's too hard.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.150
That for whatever reason,

00:02:16.174 --> 00:02:19.667
these three proteins have entered
a space, in the language of our field,

00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:21.891
that's called the undruggable genome --

00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:24.205
which is like calling
a computer unsurfable

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.485
or the Moon unwalkable.

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.617
It's a horrible term of trade.

00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:28.799
But what it means

00:02:28.823 --> 00:02:32.045
is that we've failed to identify
a greasy pocket in these proteins,

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.339
into which we, like molecular locksmiths,

00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:39.455
can fashion an active, small,
organic molecule or drug substance.

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:42.467
Now, as I was training
in clinical medicine

00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:45.952
and hematology and oncology
and stem-cell transplantation,

00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:47.849
what we had instead,

00:02:47.873 --> 00:02:51.388
cascading through the regulatory
network at the FDA,

00:02:51.412 --> 00:02:52.845
were these substances:

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:54.178
arsenic,

00:02:54.202 --> 00:02:55.367
thalidomide,

00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:58.748
and this chemical derivative
of nitrogen mustard gas.

00:02:58.772 --> 00:03:01.381
And this is the 21st century.

00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:02.651
And so, I guess you'd say,

00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:05.812
dissatisfied with the performance
and quality of these medicines,

00:03:05.836 --> 00:03:08.109
I went back to school, in chemistry,

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:13.968
with the idea that perhaps by learning
the trade of discovery chemistry

00:03:13.992 --> 00:03:16.865
and approaching it in the context
of this brave new world

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.101
of the open source,

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:20.553
the crowd source,

00:03:20.577 --> 00:03:23.882
the collaborative network
that we have access to within academia,

00:03:23.906 --> 00:03:28.184
that we might more quickly bring
powerful and targeted therapies

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.570
to our patients.

00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:33.051
And so, please consider
this a work in progress,

00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:35.092
but I'd like to tell you today a story

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:38.317
about a very rare cancer
called midline carcinoma,

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:43.333
about the undruggable protein target
that causes this cancer,

00:03:43.357 --> 00:03:44.885
called BRD4,

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.754
and about a molecule developed at my lab
at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,

00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:49.930
called JQ1,

00:03:49.954 --> 00:03:52.176
which we affectionately named for Jun Qi,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.239
the chemist that made this molecule.

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.665
Now, BRD4 is an interesting protein.

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:01.370
You might ask: with all the things
cancer's trying to do to kill our patient,

00:04:01.394 --> 00:04:02.982
how does it remember it's cancer?

00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:04.437
When it winds up its genome,

00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:06.832
divides into two cells and unwinds again,

00:04:06.856 --> 00:04:09.093
why does it not turn
into an eye, into a liver,

00:04:09.117 --> 00:04:11.498
as it has all the genes
necessary to do this?

00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:13.084
It remembers that it's cancer.

00:04:13.948 --> 00:04:17.036
And the reason is that cancer,
like every cell in the body,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.036
places little molecular bookmarks,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.438
little Post-it notes,

00:04:20.462 --> 00:04:23.445
that remind the cell, "I'm cancer;
I should keep growing."

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.073
And those Post-it notes involve this
and other proteins of its class --

00:04:28.097 --> 00:04:29.413
so-called bromodomains.

00:04:29.992 --> 00:04:32.660
So we developed an idea, a rationale,

00:04:32.684 --> 00:04:34.833
that perhaps if we made a molecule

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:37.150
that prevented
the Post-it note from sticking

00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:38.833
by entering into the little pocket

00:04:38.857 --> 00:04:40.713
at the base of this spinning protein,

00:04:40.737 --> 00:04:42.793
then maybe we could convince cancer cells,

00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:45.618
certainly those addicted
to this BRD4 protein,

00:04:45.642 --> 00:04:46.959
that they're not cancer.

00:04:47.678 --> 00:04:49.901
And so we started to work on this problem.

00:04:49.925 --> 00:04:52.227
We developed libraries of compounds

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:55.036
and eventually arrived
at this and similar substances

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.242
called JQ1.

00:04:56.837 --> 00:04:58.401
Now, not being a drug company,

00:04:58.425 --> 00:05:01.519
we could do certain things,
we had certain flexibilities,

00:05:01.543 --> 00:05:04.377
that I respect that a pharmaceutical
industry doesn't have.

00:05:04.401 --> 00:05:06.651
We just started mailing it to our friends.

00:05:07.143 --> 00:05:08.296
I have a small lab.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.725
We thought we'd just send it to people
and see how the molecule behaves.

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:13.199
We sent it to Oxford, England,

00:05:13.223 --> 00:05:16.445
where a group of talented
crystallographers provided this picture,

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:19.566
which helped us understand exactly
how this molecule is so potent

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.756
for this protein target.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.716
It's what we call a perfect fit
of shape complementarity,

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.890
or hand in glove.

00:05:25.587 --> 00:05:27.208
Now, this is a very rare cancer,

00:05:27.232 --> 00:05:29.036
this BRD4-addicted cancer.

00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:31.692
And so we worked with samples of material

00:05:31.716 --> 00:05:35.290
that were collected by young pathologists
at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

00:05:35.314 --> 00:05:37.687
And as we treated these cells
with this molecule,

00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:39.750
we observed something really striking.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.266
The cancer cells --

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.357
small, round and rapidly dividing,

00:05:43.381 --> 00:05:45.734
grew these arms and extensions.

00:05:45.758 --> 00:05:47.122
They were changing shape.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.907
In effect,

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:52.238
the cancer cell
was forgetting it was cancer

00:05:52.262 --> 00:05:53.770
and becoming a normal cell.

00:05:55.336 --> 00:05:56.693
This got us very excited.

00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:00.689
The next step would be to put
this molecule into mice.

00:06:00.713 --> 00:06:04.108
The only problem was there's no
mouse model of this rare cancer.

00:06:04.132 --> 00:06:06.855
And so at the time
we were doing this research,

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.452
I was caring for a 29-year-old
firefighter from Connecticut

00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:12.358
who was very much at the end of life

00:06:12.382 --> 00:06:14.238
with this incurable cancer.

00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:18.331
This BRD4-addicted cancer
was growing throughout his left lung.

00:06:18.355 --> 00:06:21.520
And he had a chest tube in
that was draining little bits of debris.

00:06:21.544 --> 00:06:24.505
And every nursing shift,
we would throw this material out.

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:26.296
And so we approached this patient

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.332
and asked if he would collaborate with us.

00:06:28.975 --> 00:06:32.674
Could we take this precious
and rare cancerous material

00:06:32.698 --> 00:06:34.297
from this chest tube

00:06:34.321 --> 00:06:36.540
and drive it across town
and put it into mice

00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:40.205
and try to do a clinical trial
at a stage that with a prototype drug,

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.253
well, that would be, of course, impossible

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:44.110
and, rightly, illegal to do in humans.

00:06:44.134 --> 00:06:45.387
And he obliged us.

00:06:46.266 --> 00:06:48.458
At the Lurie Family Center
for Animal Imaging,

00:06:48.482 --> 00:06:52.097
our colleague, Andrew Kung,
grew this cancer successfully in mice

00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:53.811
without ever touching plastic.

00:06:53.835 --> 00:06:57.251
And you can see this PET scan
of a mouse -- what we call a pet PET.

00:06:57.275 --> 00:06:58.831
The cancer is growing

00:06:58.855 --> 00:07:01.760
as this red, huge mass
in the hind limb of this animal.

00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:04.404
And as we treat it with our compound,

00:07:04.428 --> 00:07:06.036
this addiction to sugar,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.651
this rapid growth, faded.

00:07:07.675 --> 00:07:09.718
And on the animal on the right,

00:07:09.742 --> 00:07:11.753
you see that the cancer was responding.

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:15.036
We've completed, now, clinical trials

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.036
in four mouse models of this disease.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.909
And every time, we see the same thing.

00:07:18.933 --> 00:07:21.638
The mice with this cancer
that get the drug live,

00:07:21.662 --> 00:07:23.958
and the ones that don't rapidly perish.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.489
So we started to wonder,

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:29.617
what would a drug company
do at this point?

00:07:29.641 --> 00:07:31.690
Well, they probably
would keep this a secret

00:07:31.714 --> 00:07:33.599
until they turn the prototype drug

00:07:33.623 --> 00:07:35.767
into an active pharmaceutical substance.

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:37.764
So we did just the opposite.

00:07:38.144 --> 00:07:40.979
We published a paper
that described this finding

00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:42.979
at the earliest prototype stage.

00:07:43.773 --> 00:07:46.681
We gave the world the chemical
identity of this molecule,

00:07:46.705 --> 00:07:48.602
typically a secret in our discipline.

00:07:48.626 --> 00:07:50.602
We told people exactly how to make it.

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:52.967
We gave them our email address,

00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:54.642
suggesting that if they write us,

00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:56.268
we'll send them a free molecule.

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:57.380
(Laughter)

00:07:57.404 --> 00:08:00.301
We basically tried to create
the most competitive environment

00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:01.485
for our lab as possible.

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:03.451
And this was, unfortunately, successful.

00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:04.499
(Laughter)

00:08:04.523 --> 00:08:06.528
Because now, we've shared this molecule,

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:08.955
just since December of last year,

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:11.234
with 40 laboratories in the United States

00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:13.036
and 30 more in Europe --

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.909
many of them pharmaceutical companies,

00:08:14.933 --> 00:08:16.528
seeking now to enter this space,

00:08:16.552 --> 00:08:19.601
to target this rare cancer
that, thankfully right now,

00:08:20.456 --> 00:08:23.069
is quite desirable
to study in that industry.

00:08:25.322 --> 00:08:28.391
But the science that's coming back
from all of these laboratories

00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:30.249
about the use of this molecule

00:08:30.273 --> 00:08:33.446
has provided us insights
we might not have had on our own.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.447
Leukemia cells treated with this compound

00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:37.887
turn into normal white blood cells.

00:08:38.536 --> 00:08:40.317
Mice with multiple myeloma,

00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:43.376
an incurable malignancy
of the bone marrow,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.377
respond dramatically

00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:47.116
to the treatment with this drug.

00:08:47.576 --> 00:08:49.552
You might know that fat has memory.

00:08:50.624 --> 00:08:52.600
I'll nicely demonstrate that for you.

00:08:52.624 --> 00:08:53.655
(Laughter)

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:55.231
In fact, this molecule

00:08:55.255 --> 00:08:58.655
prevents this adipocyte,
this fat stem cell,

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:01.548
from remembering how to make fat,

00:09:01.572 --> 00:09:03.940
such that mice on a high-fat diet,

00:09:03.964 --> 00:09:06.078
like the folks
in my hometown of Chicago --

00:09:06.102 --> 00:09:07.110
(Laughter)

00:09:07.134 --> 00:09:09.142
fail to develop fatty liver,

00:09:09.166 --> 00:09:10.989
which is a major medical problem.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.752
What this research taught us --

00:09:13.776 --> 00:09:16.036
not just my lab, but our institute,

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.132
and Harvard Medical School
more generally --

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:20.417
is that we have unique
resources in academia

00:09:20.441 --> 00:09:21.775
for drug discovery;

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:24.982
that our center, which has tested
perhaps more cancer molecules

00:09:25.006 --> 00:09:26.163
in a scientific way

00:09:26.187 --> 00:09:27.338
than any other,

00:09:27.362 --> 00:09:28.837
never made one of its own.

00:09:29.805 --> 00:09:31.972
For all the reasons you see listed here,

00:09:31.996 --> 00:09:34.735
we think there's a great
opportunity for academic centers

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:38.583
to participate in this earliest,
conceptually tricky

00:09:38.607 --> 00:09:40.537
and creative discipline

00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:42.343
of prototype drug discovery.

00:09:45.132 --> 00:09:46.282
So what next?

00:09:46.609 --> 00:09:48.989
We have this molecule,
but it's not a pill yet.

00:09:49.013 --> 00:09:51.607
It's not orally bioavailable.

00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:54.826
We need to fix it so we can
deliver it to our patients.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.434
And everyone in the lab,

00:09:56.458 --> 00:09:59.259
especially following the interaction
with these patients,

00:09:59.283 --> 00:10:01.608
feels quite compelled
to deliver a drug substance

00:10:01.632 --> 00:10:02.830
based on this molecule.

00:10:02.854 --> 00:10:04.265
It's here where I'd say

00:10:04.289 --> 00:10:06.504
that we could use your help
and your insights,

00:10:06.528 --> 00:10:08.390
your collaborative participation.

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:12.422
Unlike a drug company,
we don't have a pipeline

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:14.453
that we can deposit these molecules into.

00:10:14.477 --> 00:10:16.874
We don't have a team
of salespeople and marketeers

00:10:16.898 --> 00:10:19.609
to tell us how to position
this drug against the other.

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:22.301
What we do have is the flexibility
of an academic center

00:10:22.325 --> 00:10:24.677
to work with competent, motivated,

00:10:24.701 --> 00:10:27.606
enthusiastic, hopefully well-funded people

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.923
to carry these molecules
forward into the clinic

00:10:29.947 --> 00:10:33.645
while preserving our ability
to share the prototype drug worldwide.

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:37.375
This molecule will soon leave our benches

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:40.449
and go into a small start-up company
called Tensha Therapeutics.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:43.409
And, really, this is the fourth
of these molecules

00:10:43.433 --> 00:10:45.680
to kind of "graduate"
from our little pipeline

00:10:45.704 --> 00:10:47.158
of drug discovery,

00:10:47.182 --> 00:10:51.538
two of which -- a topical drug
for lymphoma of the skin

00:10:52.457 --> 00:10:55.568
and an oral substance for the treatment
of multiple myeloma --

00:10:55.592 --> 00:10:58.830
will actually come to the bedside
for the first clinical trial

00:10:58.854 --> 00:11:02.377
in July of this year -- for us,
a major and exciting milestone.

00:11:03.909 --> 00:11:05.932
I want to leave you with just two ideas.

00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:10.290
The first is: if anything is unique
about this research,

00:11:10.314 --> 00:11:12.671
it's less the science than the strategy.

00:11:12.695 --> 00:11:15.117
This, for us, was a social experiment --

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:20.406
an experiment in "What would happen
if we were as open and honest

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.946
at the earliest phase
of discovery chemistry research

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.417
as we could be?"

00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:26.782
This string of letters and numbers

00:11:26.806 --> 00:11:28.821
and symbols and parentheses

00:11:28.845 --> 00:11:30.464
that can be texted, I suppose,

00:11:30.488 --> 00:11:31.915
or Twittered worldwide,

00:11:33.208 --> 00:11:35.710
is the chemical identity
of our pro compound.

00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:39.816
It's the information that we most need
from pharmaceutical companies,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.554
the information on how these early
prototype drugs might work.

00:11:44.948 --> 00:11:47.072
Yet this information is largely a secret.

00:11:47.742 --> 00:11:50.621
And so we seek, really, to download

00:11:50.645 --> 00:11:53.764
from the amazing successes
of the computer-science industry,

00:11:53.788 --> 00:11:58.167
two principles -- that of open source
and that of crowdsourcing --

00:11:58.191 --> 00:12:04.185
to quickly, responsibly accelerate
the delivery of targeted therapeutics

00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:05.716
to patients with cancer.

00:12:06.377 --> 00:12:09.496
Now, the business model
involves all of you.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.496
This research is funded by the public.

00:12:11.845 --> 00:12:13.223
It's funded by foundations.

00:12:13.247 --> 00:12:14.977
And one thing I've learned in Boston

00:12:15.001 --> 00:12:18.075
is that you people will do anything
for cancer, and I love that.

00:12:18.099 --> 00:12:20.996
You bike across the state,
you walk up and down the river.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.560
(Laughter)

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.476
I've never seen, really, anywhere,

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.743
this unique support for cancer research.

00:12:28.767 --> 00:12:30.524
And so I want to thank you

00:12:30.548 --> 00:12:33.845
for your participation, your collaboration

00:12:33.869 --> 00:12:35.030
and most of all,

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:36.988
for your confidence in our ideas.

00:12:37.012 --> 00:12:42.513
(Applause)
