00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.236
Imagine that when you walked
in here this evening,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.340
you discovered that everybody in the room
looked almost exactly the same:

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.036
ageless, raceless,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.300
generically good-looking.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.076
That person sitting right next to you

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.236
might have the most
idiosyncratic inner life,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.516
but you don't have a clue

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.100
because we're all wearing
the same blank expression all the time.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.140
That is the kind of creepy transformation
that is taking over cities,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.780
only it applies to buildings, not people.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.276
Cities are full of roughness and shadow,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.516
texture and color.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.700
You can still find architectural surfaces
of great individuality and character

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.100
in apartment buildings in Riga

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.100
and Yemen,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.860
social housing in Vienna,

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.196
Hopi villages in Arizona,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.660
brownstones in New York,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.940
wooden houses in San Francisco.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.500
These aren't palaces or cathedrals.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.676
These are just ordinary residences

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.260
expressing the ordinary
splendor of cities.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.596
And the reason they're like that
is that the need for shelter

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.700
is so bound up with
the human desire for beauty.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.140
Their rough surfaces
give us a touchable city.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.236
Right? Streets that you can read

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.380
by running your fingers
over brick and stone.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.100
But that's getting harder to do,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.260
because cities are becoming smooth.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.556
New downtowns sprout towers

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.916
that are almost always
made of concrete and steel

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.300
and covered in glass.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.596
You can look at skylines
all over the world --

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.820
Houston,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.660
Guangzhou,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.460
Frankfurt --

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.676
and you see the same army
of high-gloss robots

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.980
marching over the horizon.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.516
Now, just think of everything we lose

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.780
when architects stop using
the full range of available materials.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.356
When we reject granite
and limestone and sandstone

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.556
and wood and copper
and terra-cotta and brick

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.100
and wattle and plaster,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.076
we simplify architecture

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.660
and we impoverish cities.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.396
It's as if you reduced
all of the world's cuisines

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.356
down to airline food.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.436
(Laughter)

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.660
Chicken or pasta?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.580
But worse still,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.156
assemblies of glass towers
like this one in Moscow

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.076
suggest a disdain for the civic
and communal aspects of urban living.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.156
Right? Buildings like these are intended
to enrich their owners and tenants,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.756
but not necessarily
the lives of the rest of us,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.420
those of us who navigate
the spaces between the buildings.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.300
And we expect to do so for free.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.060
Shiny towers are an invasive species

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.140
and they are choking our cities
and killing off public space.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.596
We tend to think of a facade
as being like makeup,

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.382
a decorative layer applied at the end
to a building that's effectively complete.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.516
But just because a facade is superficial

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.796
doesn't mean it's not also deep.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.100
Let me give you an example

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.036
of how a city's surfaces
affect the way we live in it.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.956
When I visited Salamanca in Spain,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.236
I gravitated to the Plaza Mayor

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.676
at all hours of the day.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.676
Early in the morning,
sunlight rakes the facades,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.396
sharpening shadows,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.716
and at night, lamplight
segments the buildings

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.580
into hundreds of distinct areas,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.716
balconies and windows and arcades,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.580
each one a separate pocket
of visual activity.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.140
That detail and depth, that glamour

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.860
gives the plaza a theatrical quality.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.220
It becomes a stage
where the generations can meet.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.356
You have teenagers
sprawling on the pavers,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.196
seniors monopolizing the benches,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.116
and real life starts to look
like an opera set.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.900
The curtain goes up on Salamanca.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.420
So just because I'm talking
about the exteriors of buildings,

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.340
not form, not function, not structure,

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.980
even so those surfaces
give texture to our lives,

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:32.116
because buildings
create the spaces around them,

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.156
and those spaces can draw people in

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.380
or push them away.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.796
And the difference often has to do
with the quality of those exteriors.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.556
So one contemporary equivalent
of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.900
is the Place de la DÃ©fense in Paris,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.316
a windswept, glass-walled open space

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.116
that office workers hurry through

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.636
on the way from the metro
to their cubicles

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.020
but otherwise spend
as little time in as possible.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.236
In the early 1980s,
the architect Philip Johnson

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.020
tried to recreate a gracious
European plaza in Pittsburgh.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.996
This is PPG Place,

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.236
a half acre of open space
encircled by commercial buildings

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.716
made of mirrored glass.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.156
And he ornamented those buildings
with metal trim and bays

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.116
and Gothic turrets

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.860
which really pop on the skyline.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.980
But at ground level,

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.060
the plaza feels like a black glass cage.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.756
I mean, sure, in summertime

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.236
kids are running back and forth
through the fountain

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.236
and there's ice-skating in the winter,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.476
but it lacks the informality
of a leisurely hangout.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.500
It's just not the sort of place
you really want to just hang out and chat.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.036
Public spaces thrive or fail
for many different reasons.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.460
Architecture is only one,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.700
but it's an important one.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.996
Some recent plazas

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.380
like Federation Square in Melbourne

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.900
or Superkilen in Copenhagen

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.156
succeed because they combine old and new,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.380
rough and smooth,

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.076
neutral and bright colors,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.740
and because they don't rely
excessively on glass.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.780
Now, I'm not against glass.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.340
It's an ancient and versatile material.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.676
It's easy to manufacture and transport

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.756
and install and replace

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.316
and clean.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.236
It comes in everything
from enormous, ultraclear sheets

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.340
to translucent bricks.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.316
New coatings make it change mood

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.580
in the shifting light.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.956
In expensive cities like New York,
it has the magical power

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.596
of being able to multiply
real estate values by allowing views,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.716
which is really the only commodity
that developers have to offer

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.460
to justify those surreal prices.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.156
In the middle of the 19th century,

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.956
with the construction
of the Crystal Palace in London,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.020
glass leapt to the top of the list
of quintessentially modern substances.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.596
By the mid-20th century,

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.740
it had come to dominate
the downtowns of some American cities,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.516
largely through some
really spectacular office buildings

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.500
like Lever House in midtown Manhattan,
designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.076
Eventually, the technology
advanced to the point

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.196
where architects could design
structures so transparent

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.506
they practically disappear.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.596
And along the way,

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.660
glass became the default material
of the high-rise city,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.996
and there's a very
powerful reason for that.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.740
Because as the world's populations
converge on cities,

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.476
the least fortunate pack
into jerry-built shantytowns.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.316
But hundreds of millions of people
need apartments and places to work

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.556
in ever-larger buildings,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.196
so it makes economic sense
to put up towers

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.700
and wrap them in cheap
and practical curtain walls.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.980
But glass has a limited ability

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.100
to be expressive.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.236
This is a section of wall framing a plaza

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.340
in the pre-Hispanic city of Mitla,
in southern Mexico.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.956
Those 2,000-year-old carvings

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.020
make it clear that this was a place
of high ritual significance.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:22.836
Today we look at those and we can see
a historical and textural continuity

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.716
between those carvings,
the mountains all around

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.596
and that church which is built
on top of the ruins

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.780
using stone plundered from the site.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.596
In nearby Oaxaca,
even ordinary plaster buildings

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.956
become canvasses for
bright colors, political murals

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.820
and sophisticated graphic arts.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.420
It's an intricate, communicative language

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.859
that an epidemic of glass
would simply wipe out.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.556
The good news is
that architects and developers

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.556
have begun to rediscover
the joys of texture

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.620
without backing away from modernity.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.180
Some find innovative uses
for old materials like brick

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.340
and terra-cotta.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.876
Others invent new products
like the molded panels that SnÃ¸hetta used

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.316
to give the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.700
that crinkly, sculptural quality.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.236
The architect Stefano Boeri
even created living facades.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.276
This is his Vertical Forest,
a pair of apartment towers in Milan,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.180
whose most visible feature is greenery.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.580
And Boeri is designing a version of this
for Nanjing in China.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.036
And imagine if green facades
were as ubiquitous as glass ones

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.700
how much cleaner the air
in Chinese cities would become.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.116
But the truth is
that these are mostly one-offs,

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.636
boutique projects,

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.900
not easily reproduced at a global scale.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.020
And that is the point.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.276
When you use materials
that have a local significance,

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.420
you prevent cities
from all looking the same.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.436
Copper has a long history in New York --

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.780
the Statue of Liberty,

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.350
the crown of the Woolworth Building --

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.196
but it fell out of fashion for a long time

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.596
until SHoP Architects used it
to cover the American Copper Building,

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.060
a pair of twisting towers
on the East River.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.236
It's not even finished

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.356
and you can see the way
sunset lights up that metallic facade,

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.420
which will weather to green as it ages.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.836
Buildings can be like people.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.180
Their faces broadcast their experience.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.676
And that's an important point,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.740
because when glass ages,

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.116
you just replace it,

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.036
and the building looks
pretty much the same way it did before

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.756
until eventually it's demolished.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.556
Almost all other materials
have the ability

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.156
to absorb infusions of history and memory,

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.500
and project it into the present.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.516
The firm Ennead

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.436
clad the Utah Natural History Museum
in Salt Lake City in copper and zinc,

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.660
ores that have been mined
in the area for 150 years

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.340
and that also camouflage the building
against the ochre hills

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.476
so that you have a natural history museum

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.740
that reflects the region's
natural history.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.276
And when the Chinese
Pritzker Prize winner Wang Shu

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.636
was building a history museum in Ningbo,

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.876
he didn't just create
a wrapper for the past,

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.956
he built memory right into the walls

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.676
by using brick and stones and shingles

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.460
salvaged from villages
that had been demolished.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.116
Now, architects can use glass

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.916
in equally lyrical and inventive ways.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.636
Here in New York, two buildings,

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.300
one by Jean Nouvel
and this one by Frank Gehry

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.820
face off across West 19th Street,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.556
and the play of reflections
that they toss back and forth

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.940
is like a symphony in light.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.116
But when a city defaults to glass

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.636
as it grows,

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.220
it becomes a hall of mirrors,

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.100
disquieting and cold.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.700
After all, cities are places
of concentrated variety

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.516
where the world's cultures
and languages and lifestyles

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.740
come together and mingle.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.820
So rather than encase all that variety

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.596
and diversity in buildings
of crushing sameness,

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.300
we should have an architecture that honors
the full range of the urban experience.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.036
Thank you.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:38.458
(Applause)
