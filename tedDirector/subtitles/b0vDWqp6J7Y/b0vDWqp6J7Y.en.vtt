00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Charles and Ray were a team. They were husband and wife.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
Despite the New York Times' and Vanity Fair's best efforts recently,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
they're not brothers. (Laughter)

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
And they were a lot of fun.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
You know, Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
(Laughter)

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
We are going to focus on Charles today, because it is Charles' 100th birthday.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
But when I speak of him, I'm really speaking of both of them as a team.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
Here's Charles when he was three. So he would be 100 this June.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
We have a lot of cool celebrations that we're going to do.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
The thing about their work

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
is that most people come to the door of furniture --

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
I suspect you probably recognize this chair

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
and some of the others I'm going to show you.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
But we're going to first enter through the door of the Big Top.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
The whole thing about this, though, is that, you know, why am I showing it?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
Is it because Charles and Ray made this film?

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.160
This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
They also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
was not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
There is a picture of Charles. So let's watch the next clip.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.160
The film that we're about to see is a film they made for the Moscow World's Fair.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
Video: This is the land.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
It has many contrasts.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.160
It is rough and it is flat.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
In places it is cold.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
In some it is hot.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
Too much rain falls on some areas,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
and not enough on others.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
But people live on this land.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
And, as in Russia,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.160
they are drawn together into towns and cities.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
Here is something of the way they live.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
Eames Demetrios: Now, this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the United States.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.160
It was on seven screens and it was 200 feet across.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
And it was at the height of the Cold War.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
The Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen Debate

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
happened about 50 feet from where this was shown.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
And yet, how did it start?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
You know, commonality, the first line

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
in Charles' narration was,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
"The same stars that shine down on Russia

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
shine down on the United States. From the sky,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
our cities look much the same."

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
It was that human connection that Charles and Ray always found in everything.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
And you can imagine, and the thing about it is,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
because the important thing was to get the gestalt

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
of what the images were about.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
So that was just a little snip.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
But the thing about Charles and Ray

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
is that they were always modeling stuff.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
They were always trying things out.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
I think one of the things I am passionate about, my grandparents work,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
I'm passionate about my work,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
but on top of all that I'm passionate

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
about a holistic vision of design,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
where design is a life skill, not a professional skill.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
And you know, those of us with kids often want our kids to take music.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
I'm no exception.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
But it's not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
It's about getting that music thing going through their heads and their thinking.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
Design is the same way. Design has to become that same way.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
And this is a model that they did of that seven-screen presentation.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
And Charles just checking it out there.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
So now we're going to go through that door of furniture.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
This is an unusual installation of airport seating.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.160
So what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
And the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
was essentially that of a good host,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
anticipating the needs of the guest.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
So those are cool images. But these are ones I think are really cool.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
These are all the prototypes. These are the mistakes,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
although I don't think mistakes is the right word in design.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
It's just the things you try out

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
to kind of make it work better.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
And you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Some of them are kind of cool looking. It's like "Hey, why didn't they try that?"

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
It was that hands-on iterative process

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
which is so much like vernacular design

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
and folk design in traditional cultures.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
And I think that's one of the commonalities between modernism

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
and traditional design. I think it may be a real common ground

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
as we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next 20 or 30 years.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
The other thing that's kind of cool is that

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
you look at this and in the media when people say design,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
they actually mean style.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
And I'm really here to talk about design.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
But you know the object is just a pivot.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
It's a pivot between a process and a system.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.160
And this is a little film I made

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
about the making of the Eames lounge chair.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.160
The design process for Charles and Ray

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.160
never ended in manufacturing.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
It continued. They were always trying to make thing better and better.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.160
Because it's like as Bill Clinton was saying about Rwandan health clinics.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
It's not enough to create one.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
You've got to create a system that will work better and better.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
So I've always liked this prototype picture.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
Because it just kind of, you know, doesn't get any more basic than that.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
You try things out.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
This is a relatively famous chair.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
Its early version had an "X" base. That's what the collectors like.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
Charles and Ray liked this one because it was better.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
It worked better: "H" base, much more practical.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
This is something called a splint.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
And I was very touched by Dean Kamen's

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.160
work for the military, or for the soldiers,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.160
because Charles and Ray designed a molded plywood splint. This is it.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
And they'd been working on furniture before.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
which was incredibly important to them.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
I'm trying to show you too much,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
because I want you to really get a broth of ideas and images.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
This is a house that Charles and Ray designed.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
My sister is chasing someone else. It's not me.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.160
Although I endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary, it's not me.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.160
And then this is a film, on the lower left, that Charles and Ray made.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
Now look at that plastic chair.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
The house is 1949.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
The chair is done in 1949.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160
Charles and Ray,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
they didn't obsess about style for it's own sake.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.160
They didn't say, "Our style is curves. Let's make the house curvy."

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160
They didn't say, "Our style is grids. Let's make the chair griddy."

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
They focused on the need.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160
They tried to solve the design problem.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
Charles used to say, "The extent to which you have a design style

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem."

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.160
It's kind of a brutal quote.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
This is the earlier design of that house.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
And again, they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
of a house -- architecture, very expensive medium.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
Here's a film we've been hearing things about.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
The "Powers of Ten" is a film they made.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
If we watch the next clip,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
you're going to see the first version of "Powers of Ten," upper left.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.160
The familiar one on the lower right.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160
The Eames' film Tops, lower left.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
And a lamp that Charles designed for a church.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
Video: Which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
These form part of a grouping system

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
much as the stars do.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
They are so many and so varied that from this distance

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
they appear like the stars from Earth.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
ED: You've seen that film, and what's so great about this

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
Everybody here is coming at it from a different way.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
I want to give you one example.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
E.O. Wilson once told me that when he looked at ants --

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
he loved them, of course, and he wanted to learn more about them --

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160
he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
So here is the tiny creature.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
And yet simply by changing the frame of reference

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.160
it reveals so much, including what ended up being the TED Prize.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.160
Modeling, they tried modeling all the time. They were always modeling things.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
And I think part of that is that they never delegated understanding.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.160
And I think in our family we were very lucky,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
because we learned about design backwards.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
Design was not something other.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
It was part of the business of life in general.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
It was part of the quality of life.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
And here is some family pictures.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
And you can see why I'm down on style, with a haircut like that.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
But anyway, (Laughter)

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
I remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the Eames house when I was a kid.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
So we're going to watch another film.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
This is a film, the one called Toys.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.160
You can see me, I have the same haircut, in the upper right corner.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.160
Upper left is a film they did on toy trains.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
Lower right is a solar do-nothing toy.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
Charles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.160
They are often the precursor to bigger things.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
And these ideas -- that train up there, being about the honest use of materials,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
is totally the same

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.160
as the honest use of materials in the plywood.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.160
And now I'm going to test you.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.160
This is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
So can you read it?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
Lucia angel,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
okay, eye.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.160
Audience: Saw many trains.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.160
ED: Awl, also, good that the leather crafter's guild is here.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.160
Also, what is he doing? Row, rowed.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.160
Sun? No. Well is there another name for a sunrise?

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
Dawn, very good.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
Also rode on one. I ...

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
Audience: You had, I hope you had --

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
ED: Now you've been to the website Dogs of Saint Louis

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
in the late, in the mid-1930's,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
then you'd know that was a Great Dane.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
So, I hope you had a

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.160
Audience: Nice time, time --

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
ED: Time at.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
Citizen Kane, rose --

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
Audience: Rosebud.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
ED: No, bud. "D"'s right. At Buddy's --

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.160
Audience: Party. Love.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.160
ED: Okay, good.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160
So, "I saw many trains and also rode on one.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160
I hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party."

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.160
So you guys did pretty good, cool.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
So my mom and Charles had this great relationship

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
where they'd send those sorts of things back and forth to one another.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.160
And it's all part of the, you know,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
they used to say, "Take your pleasure seriously."

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
These are some images from a project of mine

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
that's called Kymaerica.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
It's sort of an alternative universe.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
It's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
Those plaques are plaques we've been installing around North America.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
We're about to do six in the U.K. next week.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
So, of course, since it's bronze it has to be true.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.160
Video: Kymaerica with waterfalls,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
tumbling through our --

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
ED: This is one of the traditional Kymaerican songs.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:46.160
And so we had spelling bees in Paris, Illinois.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
Video: Your word is N. Carolina.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
Girl: Y-I-N-D-I-A-N-A.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.160
ED: And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
because in the Kymaerican story

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
this is where the Parisian Diaspora started, where there embassy was.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
So you can actually visit and have this three-dimensional

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
fictional experience there.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
And the town has really embraced it.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
We had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
But what is really cool is that we take our visual environment

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
as inevitable. And it's not.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
Other things could have happened. The Japanese could have discovered Monterey.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
And we could have been born 100,000 years ago.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160
And there are a lot of fun things. This is the Museum of the Bench.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
They have trading cards

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
and all sorts of cool things.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.160
And you're kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
The Tahatchabe, the great road building culture.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
A guy named Nobu Naga,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
the so-called Japanese Columbus.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
But now I'm going to return you to the real world.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
And this is Cranbrook. I've got a real treat for you,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
which is the first film that Charles ever made.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
So let's watch that. Nobody's ever seen it.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.160
Cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.160
It's a film about Maya Gretel, a famous ceramicist, and a teacher at Cranbrook.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.160
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:03.160
Silent. We don't have a track for it yet.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
Very simple. It's just a start. But it's that learn-by-doing thing.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
You want to learn how to make films? Go make a movie.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
And you try something out.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
But here is what's really great.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.160
See that chair there? The orange one? That's the organic chair. 1940.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160
At the same time that Charles was doing that chair,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
he was doing this film.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
So my point is that this scope of vision, this holistic vision

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
of design, was with them from the beginning.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
It wasn't like "Oh, we made some chairs and got successful.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
Now we're going to do some movies."

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.160
It was always part of how they looked at the world. And that's what's really powerful.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.160
And I think that all of us in this room, as you move design forward,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.160
it's not about just doing one thing.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
It's about how you approach problems. And there is this huge, beautiful commonality

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.160
between design, business and the world.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160
So we're going to do the last clip.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
And I've shown you some of the images. I just want to focus on sound now.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
So this is Charles' voice.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.160
Charles Eames: In India, those without, and the lowest in caste,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
eat very often, particularly in southern India,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
they eat off of a banana leaf.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.160
And those a little bit up the scale

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.160
eat off of a sort of a low-fired ceramic dish.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
And a little bit higher, why they have a glaze

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
on a thing they call a thali.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.160
If you're up the scale a little bit more,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
why, a brass thali.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.160
And then things get to be a little questionable.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.160
There are things like silver-plated thalis.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
And there is solid silver thalis.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
And I suppose some nut has had a

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
gold thali that he's eaten off of.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
But you can go beyond that.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.160
And the guys that have not only means,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:44.160
but a certain amount of knowledge and understanding,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.160
go to the next step, and they eat off a banana leaf.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.160
And I think that in these times

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
when we fall back and regroup,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.160
that somehow or other,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
the banana leaf parable

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
sort of got to get working there,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.160
because I'm not prepared to say

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.160
that the banana leaf that one eats off of

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:14.160
is the same as the other eats off of.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.160
But it is that process that has happened within the man

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.160
that changes the banana leaf.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
ED: I've been looking forward to sharing that quote with you.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
Because that's part of where we've got to get to.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
And I also want to share this one.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.160
"Beyond the age of information is the age of choices."

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160
And I really think that's where we are.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
And it's kind of cool for me to be part of a family

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
and a tradition where he was talking about that in 1978.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
And part of why this stuff is important

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160
and all the things that we do are important,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.160
is that these are the ideas we need.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.160
And I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.160
That's what we all need to do.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.160
Design is not just for designers anymore. It's a process. It's not style.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
All that great thinking needs to really get about solving

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
pretty key problems.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
I really thank you for your time.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
(Applause)
