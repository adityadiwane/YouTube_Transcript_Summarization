00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:14.906
After decades of research

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.199
and billions of dollars
spent in clinical trials,

00:00:18.223 --> 00:00:21.401
we still have a problem
with cancer drug delivery.

00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:24.730
We still give patients chemotherapy,

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:26.587
which is so non-specific

00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:29.137
that even though
it kills the cancer cells,

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.446
it kind of kills
the rest of your body, too.

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:35.950
And yes, we have developed
more selective drugs,

00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:38.677
but it's still a challenge
to get them into the tumor,

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:41.617
and they end up accumulating
in the other organs as well

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.272
or passing through your urine,

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:45.077
which is a total waste.

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:48.359
And fields like mine have emerged

00:00:48.383 --> 00:00:50.349
where we try to encapsulate these drugs

00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:52.926
to protect them as they
travel through the body.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.803
But these modifications cause problems

00:00:55.827 --> 00:00:58.252
that we make more modifications to fix.

00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:03.489
So what I'm really trying to say
is we need a better drug delivery system.

00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:04.929
And I propose,

00:01:04.953 --> 00:01:07.584
rather than using solely human design,

00:01:07.608 --> 00:01:09.243
why not use nature's?

00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:14.163
Immune cells are these versatile vehicles
that travel throughout our body,

00:01:14.187 --> 00:01:16.289
patrolling for signs of disease

00:01:16.313 --> 00:01:19.457
and arriving at a wound
mere minutes after injury.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.419
So I ask you guys:

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:25.435
If immune cells are already traveling
to places of injury or disease

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:26.612
in our bodies,

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:28.293
why not add an extra passenger?

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.893
Why not use immune cells to deliver drugs

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:33.879
to cure some of our biggest problems

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:35.301
in disease?

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:38.355
I am a biomedical engineer,

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:41.380
and I want to tell you guys a story
about how I use immune cells

00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:44.639
to target one of the largest
problems in cancer.

00:01:44.663 --> 00:01:47.170
Did you know that over 90 percent
of cancer deaths

00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:48.945
can be attributed to its spread?

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.234
So if we can stop these cancer cells

00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:54.332
from going from the primary tumor
to a distant site,

00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:56.832
we can stop cancer right in its tracks

00:01:56.856 --> 00:01:59.039
and give people more of their lives back.

00:02:00.182 --> 00:02:01.762
To do this special mission,

00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:04.836
we decided to deliver
a nanoparticle made of lipids,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.093
which are the same materials
that compose your cell membrane.

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:11.077
And we've added two special molecules.

00:02:11.952 --> 00:02:14.129
One is called e-selectin,

00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:15.429
which acts as a glue

00:02:15.453 --> 00:02:18.784
that binds the nanoparticle
to the immune cell.

00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:21.716
And the second one is called trail.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.396
Trail is a therapeutic drug
that kills cancer cells

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.665
but not normal cells.

00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:29.194
Now, when you put both of these together,

00:02:29.218 --> 00:02:32.083
you have a mean killing machine on wheels.

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.162
To test this, we ran
an experiment in a mouse.

00:02:39.276 --> 00:02:42.341
So what we did was we injected
the nanoparticles,

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:46.382
and they bound almost immediately
to the immune cells in the bloodstream.

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:49.331
And then we injected the cancer cells
to mimic a process

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:52.506
through which cancer cells
spread throughout our bodies.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.662
And we found something very exciting.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.290
We found that in our treated group,

00:02:58.314 --> 00:03:03.094
over 75 percent of the cancer cells
we initially injected were dead or dying,

00:03:03.118 --> 00:03:05.815
in comparison to only around 25 percent.

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.021
So just imagine: these fewer
amount of cells were available

00:03:09.045 --> 00:03:12.157
to actually be able to spread
to a different part of the body.

00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:14.898
And this is only after
two hours of treatment.

00:03:14.922 --> 00:03:19.228
Our results were amazing,
and we had some pretty interesting press.

00:03:19.974 --> 00:03:22.224
My favorite title was actually,

00:03:22.248 --> 00:03:24.862
"Sticky balls may stop
the spread of cancer."

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:25.979
(Laughter)

00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:30.011
I can't tell you just how smug
my male colleagues were,

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:33.008
knowing that their sticky balls
might one day cure cancer.

00:03:33.032 --> 00:03:35.330
(Laughter)

00:03:35.354 --> 00:03:38.756
But I can tell you they made
some pretty, pretty, exciting,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.078
pretty ballsy t-shirts.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:44.811
This was also my first experience
talking to patients

00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:47.728
where they asked how soon
our therapy would be available.

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.424
And I keep these stories with me
to remind me of the importance

00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:54.395
of the science,
the scientists and the patients.

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.350
Now, our fast-acting results
were pretty interesting,

00:03:58.374 --> 00:04:00.507
but we still had one lingering question:

00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:02.227
Can our sticky balls,

00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:04.934
our particles actually attached
to the immune cells,

00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.899
actually stop the spread of cancer?

00:04:07.624 --> 00:04:11.900
So we went to our animal model,
and we found three important parts.

00:04:12.615 --> 00:04:15.633
Our primary tumors were smaller
in our treated animals,

00:04:15.657 --> 00:04:18.175
there were fewer cells in circulation,

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.665
and there was little to no
tumor burden in the distant organs.

00:04:22.835 --> 00:04:26.713
Now, this wasn't just a victory
for us and our sticky balls.

00:04:26.737 --> 00:04:28.844
This was also a victory to me

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.123
in drug delivery,

00:04:30.147 --> 00:04:32.078
and it represents a paradigm shift,

00:04:32.102 --> 00:04:33.348
a revolution --

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.710
to go from just using drugs,
just injecting them

00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:40.187
and hoping they go to the right
places in the body,

00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:45.202
to using immune cells
as special delivery drivers in your body.

00:04:45.975 --> 00:04:49.691
For this example, we used two molecules,
e-selectin and trail,

00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:53.499
but really, the possibility
of drugs you can use are endless.

00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:55.917
And I talked about cancer,

00:04:55.941 --> 00:04:58.603
but where disease goes,
so do immune cells.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.015
So this could be used for any disease.

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.718
Imagine using immune cells
to deliver crucial wound-healing agents

00:05:06.742 --> 00:05:08.584
after a spinal cord injury,

00:05:09.474 --> 00:05:13.871
or using immune cells to deliver drugs
past the blood-brain barrier

00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:16.256
to treat Parkinson's
or Alzheimer's disease.

00:05:17.044 --> 00:05:20.093
These are the ideas that excite me
about science the most.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.157
And from where I stand,
I see so much promise and opportunity.

00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:25.371
Thank you.

00:05:25.395 --> 00:05:28.936
(Applause)
