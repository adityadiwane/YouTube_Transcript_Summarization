00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:14.569
Motor racing is a funny old business.

00:00:14.593 --> 00:00:16.886
We make a new car every year,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.074
and then we spend the rest of the season

00:00:19.098 --> 00:00:21.850
trying to understand
what it is we've built

00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:25.071
to make it better, to make it faster.

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:28.346
And then the next year, we start again.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.584
Now, the car you see in front
of you is quite complicated.

00:00:32.608 --> 00:00:36.203
The chassis is made
up of about 11,000 components,

00:00:36.227 --> 00:00:38.671
the engine another 6,000,

00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:41.764
the electronics
about eight and a half thousand.

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:46.165
So there's about 25,000 things
there that can go wrong.

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:50.991
So motor racing is very much
about attention to detail.

00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:54.254
The other thing about Formula
1 in particular

00:00:54.278 --> 00:00:56.378
is we're always changing the car.

00:00:56.402 --> 00:00:58.658
We're always trying to make it faster.

00:00:58.682 --> 00:01:01.642
So every two weeks, we will be making

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:05.842
about 5,000 new components
to fit to the car.

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.020
Five to 10 percent of the race car

00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:11.772
will be different
every two weeks of the year.

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:14.081
So how do we do that?

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:17.825
Well, we start our life
with the racing car.

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:21.816
We have a lot of sensors
on the car to measure things.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.698
On the race car in front of you here

00:01:23.722 --> 00:01:26.857
there are about 120 sensors
when it goes into a race.

00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:30.509
It's measuring all sorts
of things around the car.

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.561
That data is logged. We're logging about

00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:36.265
500 different parameters
within the data systems,

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.930
about 13,000 health parameters and events

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:44.495
to say when things are not
working the way they should do,

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:47.320
and we're sending that data
back to the garage

00:01:47.344 --> 00:01:52.299
using telemetry at a rate
of two to four megabits per second.

00:01:52.323 --> 00:01:55.426
So during a two-hour race,
each car will be sending

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.701
750 million numbers.

00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:00.844
That's twice as many numbers
as words that each of us

00:02:00.868 --> 00:02:02.475
speaks in a lifetime.

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:05.093
It's a huge amount of data.

00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:07.738
But it's not enough just
to have data and measure it.

00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:09.896
You need to be able to do
something with it.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.290
So we've spent a lot of time and effort

00:02:12.314 --> 00:02:14.159
in turning the data into stories

00:02:14.183 --> 00:02:17.264
to be able to tell,
what's the state of the engine,

00:02:17.288 --> 00:02:19.536
how are the tires degrading,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.284
what's the situation
with fuel consumption?

00:02:23.308 --> 00:02:26.072
So all of this is taking data

00:02:26.096 --> 00:02:29.874
and turning it into knowledge
that we can act upon.

00:02:29.898 --> 00:02:32.512
Okay, so let's have a look
at a little bit of data.

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:34.542
Let's pick a bit of data from

00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:37.621
another three-month-old patient.

00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:41.792
This is a child, and what you're
seeing here is real data,

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:43.769
and on the far right-hand side,

00:02:43.793 --> 00:02:46.555
where everything starts getting
a little bit catastrophic,

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.940
that is the patient going
into cardiac arrest.

00:02:49.964 --> 00:02:53.172
It was deemed to be
an unpredictable event.

00:02:53.196 --> 00:02:56.961
This was a heart attack
that no one could see coming.

00:02:56.985 --> 00:02:59.511
But when we look at the information there,

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:01.860
we can see that things
are starting to become

00:03:01.884 --> 00:03:05.889
a little fuzzy about five minutes
or so before the cardiac arrest.

00:03:05.913 --> 00:03:07.926
We can see small changes

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.309
in things like the heart rate moving.

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:12.795
These were all undetected
by normal thresholds

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.203
which would be applied to data.

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:18.346
So the question is, why
couldn't we see it?

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.927
Was this a predictable event?

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.937
Can we look more
at the patterns in the data

00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:27.317
to be able to do things better?

00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:29.967
So this is a child,

00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:33.199
about the same age
as the racing car on stage,

00:03:33.223 --> 00:03:34.829
three months old.

00:03:34.853 --> 00:03:37.434
It's a patient with a heart problem.

00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:40.902
Now, when you look at some of the data
on the screen above,

00:03:40.926 --> 00:03:45.804
things like heart rate, pulse,
oxygen, respiration rates,

00:03:45.828 --> 00:03:48.880
they're all unusual for a normal child,

00:03:48.904 --> 00:03:51.522
but they're quite normal
for the child there,

00:03:51.546 --> 00:03:55.660
and so one of the challenges
you have in health care is,

00:03:55.684 --> 00:03:58.511
how can I look at the patient
in front of me,

00:03:58.535 --> 00:04:01.558
have something which is specific for her,

00:04:01.582 --> 00:04:04.346
and be able to detect when
things start to change,

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.445
when things start to deteriorate?

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:09.495
Because like a racing car, any patient,

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.471
when things start to go
bad, you have a short time

00:04:12.495 --> 00:04:14.302
to make a difference.

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:17.056
So what we did is we took a data system

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.187
which we run every two weeks
of the year in Formula 1

00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:23.189
and we installed it
on the hospital computers

00:04:23.213 --> 00:04:25.479
at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

00:04:25.503 --> 00:04:27.918
We streamed data
from the bedside instruments

00:04:27.942 --> 00:04:30.475
in their pediatric intensive care

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:33.930
so that we could both look
at the data in real time

00:04:33.954 --> 00:04:36.802
and, more importantly, to store the data

00:04:36.826 --> 00:04:39.859
so that we could start to learn from it.

00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:44.243
And then, we applied an application on top

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:47.513
which would allow us to tease
out the patterns in the data

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.469
in real time so we could
see what was happening,

00:04:50.493 --> 00:04:54.182
so we could determine when
things started to change.

00:04:54.206 --> 00:04:58.045
Now, in motor racing, we're
all a little bit ambitious,

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.594
audacious, a little bit
arrogant sometimes,

00:05:00.618 --> 00:05:03.992
so we decided we would also
look at the children

00:05:04.016 --> 00:05:06.949
as they were being transported
to intensive care.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.497
Why should we wait
until they arrived in the hospital

00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:11.097
before we started to look?

00:05:11.121 --> 00:05:14.094
And so we installed a real-time link

00:05:14.118 --> 00:05:16.930
between the ambulance and the hospital,

00:05:16.954 --> 00:05:20.706
just using normal 3G
telephony to send that data

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.193
so that the ambulance became an extra bed

00:05:23.217 --> 00:05:26.329
in intensive care.

00:05:26.353 --> 00:05:30.031
And then we started looking at the data.

00:05:30.055 --> 00:05:32.952
So the wiggly lines
at the top, all the colors,

00:05:32.976 --> 00:05:36.146
this is the normal sort of data
you would see on a monitor --

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.918
heart rate, pulse,
oxygen within the blood,

00:05:39.942 --> 00:05:42.553
and respiration.

00:05:42.577 --> 00:05:45.306
The lines on the bottom,
the blue and the red,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.807
these are the interesting ones.

00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:49.875
The red line is showing
an automated version

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:51.472
of the early warning score

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:54.211
that Birmingham Children's Hospital
were already running.

00:05:54.235 --> 00:05:56.297
They'd been running that since 2008,

00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:58.553
and already have stopped cardiac arrests

00:05:58.577 --> 00:06:01.310
and distress within the hospital.

00:06:01.334 --> 00:06:03.742
The blue line is an indication

00:06:03.766 --> 00:06:06.242
of when patterns start to change,

00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:08.551
and immediately, before we even started

00:06:08.575 --> 00:06:10.259
putting in clinical interpretation,

00:06:10.283 --> 00:06:13.129
we can see that the data
is speaking to us.

00:06:13.153 --> 00:06:16.665
It's telling us that something
is going wrong.

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:20.481
The plot with the red and the green blobs,

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:23.286
this is plotting different components

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.833
of the data against each other.

00:06:25.857 --> 00:06:29.673
The green is us learning
what is normal for that child.

00:06:29.697 --> 00:06:32.283
We call it the cloud of normality.

00:06:32.307 --> 00:06:34.524
And when things start to change,

00:06:34.548 --> 00:06:37.088
when conditions start to deteriorate,

00:06:37.112 --> 00:06:39.326
we move into the red line.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.983
There's no rocket science here.

00:06:41.007 --> 00:06:45.096
It is displaying data that exists
already in a different way,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.487
to amplify it, to provide
cues to the doctors,

00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:51.225
to the nurses, so they can
see what's happening.

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:54.355
In the same way that a good racing driver

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:58.399
relies on cues to decide
when to apply the brakes,

00:06:58.423 --> 00:06:59.875
when to turn into a corner,

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:02.793
we need to help
our physicians and our nurses

00:07:02.817 --> 00:07:06.413
to see when things
are starting to go wrong.

00:07:06.437 --> 00:07:09.359
So we have a very ambitious program.

00:07:09.383 --> 00:07:14.095
We think that the race is on to do
something differently.

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:16.999
We are thinking big.
It's the right thing to do.

00:07:17.023 --> 00:07:20.411
We have an approach which,
if it's successful,

00:07:20.435 --> 00:07:23.055
there's no reason why it
should stay within a hospital.

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:24.783
It can go beyond the walls.

00:07:24.807 --> 00:07:26.854
With wireless connectivity these days,

00:07:26.878 --> 00:07:30.298
there is no reason why
patients, doctors and nurses

00:07:30.322 --> 00:07:32.469
always have to be in the same place

00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:34.462
at the same time.

00:07:34.486 --> 00:07:38.457
And meanwhile, we'll take
our little three-month-old baby,

00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:42.214
keep taking it to the track,
keeping it safe,

00:07:42.238 --> 00:07:44.547
and making it faster and better.

00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:45.952
Thank you very much.

00:07:45.976 --> 00:07:50.930
(Applause)
