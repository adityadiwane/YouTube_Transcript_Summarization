00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.380
I've learned some of
my most important life lessons

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.879
from drug dealers

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:22.250
and gang members

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.503
and prostitutes,

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:30.130
and I've had some of my most
profound theological conversations

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.704
not in the hallowed halls of a seminary

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:36.120
but on a street corner

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.051
on a Friday night, at 1 a.m.

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:45.872
That's a little unusual, since I am
a Baptist minister, seminary-trained,

00:00:45.872 --> 00:00:50.226
and pastored a church for over 20 years,

00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:51.474
but it's true.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:55.264
It came as a part of my participation

00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:59.490
in a public safety
crime reduction strategy

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.247
that saw a 79 percent reduction
in violent crime

00:01:03.247 --> 00:01:06.525
over an eight-year period in a major city.

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:09.242
But I didn't start out wanting to be

00:01:09.242 --> 00:01:12.585
a part of somebody's
crime reduction strategy.

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:16.220
I was 25, had my first church.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.600
If you would have asked me
what my ambition was,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.917
I would have told you
I wanted to be a megachurch pastor.

00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:26.865
I wanted a 15-, 20,000-member church.

00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:29.675
I wanted my own television ministry.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:32.391
I wanted my own clothing line.

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:33.747
(Laughter)

00:01:33.747 --> 00:01:35.888
I wanted to be your long distance carrier.

00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:37.732
You know, the whole nine yards.

00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:40.425
(Laughter)

00:01:40.425 --> 00:01:43.478
After about a year of pastoring,

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:47.100
my membership went up about 20 members.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.730
So megachurchdom was way down the road.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.554
But seriously, if you'd have said,
"What is your ambition?"

00:01:53.554 --> 00:01:55.575
I would have said just to be
a good pastor,

00:01:55.575 --> 00:01:59.940
to be able to be with people
through all the passages of life,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.213
to preach messages that would have
an everyday meaning for folks,

00:02:04.213 --> 00:02:07.115
and in the African-American tradition,

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:11.265
to be able to represent
the community that I serve.

00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:16.333
But there was something else
that was happening in my city

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.364
and in the entire metro area,

00:02:18.364 --> 00:02:22.125
and in most metro areas
in the United States,

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:27.534
and that was the homicide rate
started to rise precipitously.

00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:30.101
And there were young people
who were killing each other

00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:32.748
for reasons that I thought
were very trivial,

00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:37.642
like bumping into someone
in a high school hallway,

00:02:37.652 --> 00:02:40.921
and then after school,
shooting the person.

00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:44.427
Someone with the wrong color shirt on,

00:02:44.427 --> 00:02:48.630
on the wrong street corner
at the wrong time.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.578
And something needed
to be done about that.

00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:56.872
It got to the point where it started
to change the character of the city.

00:02:56.872 --> 00:02:59.100
You could go to any housing project,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.259
for example, like the one that was
down the street from my church,

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.161
and you would walk in,
and it would be like a ghost town,

00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:08.783
because the parents wouldn't allow
their kids to come out and play,

00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:11.847
even in the summertime,
because of the violence.

00:03:11.847 --> 00:03:14.599
You would listen in the neighborhoods
on any given night,

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.827
and to the untrained ear,
it sounded like fireworks,

00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:19.207
but it was gunfire.

00:03:19.207 --> 00:03:23.040
You'd hear it almost every night,
when you were cooking dinner,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.062
telling your child a bedtime story,
or just watching TV.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.994
And you can go to any emergency
room at any hospital,

00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:36.123
and you would see lying on gurneys

00:03:36.123 --> 00:03:40.087
young black and Latino men
shot and dying.

00:03:40.697 --> 00:03:42.532
And I was doing funerals,

00:03:42.532 --> 00:03:46.990
but not of the venerated matriarchs
and patriarchs who'd lived a long life

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.892
and there's a lot to say.

00:03:49.892 --> 00:03:52.748
I was doing funerals of 18-year-olds,

00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:54.710
17-year-olds,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.614
and 16-year-olds,

00:03:56.614 --> 00:04:01.281
and I was standing in a church
or at a funeral home

00:04:01.281 --> 00:04:03.405
struggling to say something

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:06.452
that would make some meaningful impact.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.290
And so while my colleagues were building
these cathedrals great and tall

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.628
and buying property outside of the city

00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:19.198
and moving their congregations out

00:04:19.198 --> 00:04:24.337
so that they could create
or recreate their cities of God,

00:04:24.337 --> 00:04:27.494
the social structures in the inner cities

00:04:27.494 --> 00:04:30.831
were sagging under the weight
of all of this violence.

00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:34.298
And so I stayed, because somebody
needed to do something,

00:04:34.298 --> 00:04:37.850
and so I had looked at what I had
and moved on that.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.192
I started to preach decrying
the violence in the community.

00:04:42.192 --> 00:04:44.746
And I started to look
at the programming in my church,

00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:48.647
and I started to build programs
that would catch the at-risk youth,

00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:51.576
those who were on the fence
to the violence.

00:04:52.106 --> 00:04:54.266
I even tried to be innovative
in my preaching.

00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:56.495
You all have heard of rap music, right?

00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:57.725
Rap music?

00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:00.303
I even tried to rap sermon one time.

00:05:00.303 --> 00:05:04.038
It didn't work, but at least I tried it.

00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:08.244
I'll never forget the young person
who came to me after that sermon.

00:05:08.244 --> 00:05:10.124
He waited until everybody was gone,

00:05:10.124 --> 00:05:13.956
and he said, "Rev, rap sermon, huh?"
And I was like, "Yeah, what do you think?"

00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:16.997
And he said, "Don't do that again, Rev."

00:05:16.997 --> 00:05:19.332
(Laughter)

00:05:20.132 --> 00:05:22.465
But I preached and I built these programs,

00:05:22.465 --> 00:05:24.903
and I thought maybe if
my colleagues did the same

00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:27.109
that it would make a difference.

00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:31.100
But the violence just
careened out of control,

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.833
and people who were not involved in
the violence were getting shot and killed:

00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:41.662
somebody going to buy a pack
of cigarettes at a convenience store,

00:05:41.662 --> 00:05:45.661
or someone who was sitting
at a bus stop just waiting for a bus,

00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:47.820
or kids who were playing in the park,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.117
oblivious to the violence
on the other side of the park,

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:53.811
but it coming and visiting them.

00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:56.365
Things were out of control,

00:05:56.365 --> 00:05:58.803
and I didn't know what to do,

00:05:58.803 --> 00:06:02.790
and then something happened
that changed everything for me.

00:06:03.795 --> 00:06:06.720
It was a kid by the name of Jesse McKie,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.646
walking home with his friend
Rigoberto Carrion

00:06:09.646 --> 00:06:13.350
to the housing project
down the street from my church.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.749
They met up with a group of youth
who were from a gang in Dorchester,

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:20.120
and they were killed.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.880
But as Jesse was running
from the scene mortally wounded,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.249
he was running in the direction
of my church,

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:28.037
and he died some 100, 150 yards away.

00:06:28.657 --> 00:06:32.196
If he would have gotten to the church,
it wouldn't have made a difference,

00:06:32.196 --> 00:06:34.617
because the lights were out;
nobody was home.

00:06:35.077 --> 00:06:37.501
And I took that as a sign.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.235
When they caught some of the youth
that had done this deed,

00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:44.903
to my surprise, they were around my age,

00:06:44.903 --> 00:06:48.525
but the gulf that was between us was vast.

00:06:48.525 --> 00:06:52.728
It was like we were in two
completely different worlds.

00:06:52.728 --> 00:06:55.730
And so as I contemplated all of this

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.138
and looked at what was happening,

00:06:58.138 --> 00:07:04.420
I suddenly realized that there was
a paradox that was emerging inside of me,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.836
and the paradox was this:
in all of those sermons

00:07:06.836 --> 00:07:08.819
that I preached decrying the violence,

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:13.161
I was also talking about
building community,

00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:15.343
but I suddenly realized

00:07:15.343 --> 00:07:18.432
that there was a certain
segment of the population

00:07:18.432 --> 00:07:21.941
that I was not including
in my definition of community.

00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:24.020
And so the paradox was this:

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.719
If I really wanted the community
that I was preaching for,

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:29.739
I needed to reach out

00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:34.052
and embrace this group
that I had cut out of my definition.

00:07:34.912 --> 00:07:37.529
Which meant not about building programs

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:41.128
to catch those who were
on the fences of violence,

00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:46.160
but to reach out and to embrace those
who were committing the acts of violence,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.906
the gang bangers, the drug dealers.

00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:53.494
As soon as I came to that realization,
a quick question came to my mind.

00:07:53.494 --> 00:07:55.018
Why me?

00:07:55.358 --> 00:07:57.403
I mean, isn't this a law
enforcement issue?

00:07:57.403 --> 00:07:59.293
This is why we have the police, right?

00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:04.969
As soon as the question, "Why me?" came,
the answer came just as quickly:

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:09.916
Why me? Because I'm the one who
can't sleep at night thinking about it.

00:08:10.666 --> 00:08:14.853
Because I'm the one looking around saying
somebody needs to do something about this,

00:08:14.853 --> 00:08:18.367
and I'm starting to realize
that that someone is me.

00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:20.692
I mean, isn't that how
movements start anyway?

00:08:20.692 --> 00:08:24.926
They don't start with a grand convention
and people coming together

00:08:24.926 --> 00:08:28.140
and then walking in lockstep
with a statement.

00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:33.549
But it starts with just a few,
or maybe just one.

00:08:33.924 --> 00:08:36.075
It started with me that way,

00:08:36.075 --> 00:08:40.430
and so I decided to figure out
the culture of violence

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.301
in which these young people
who were committing them existed,

00:08:43.301 --> 00:08:45.475
and I started to volunteer
at the high school.

00:08:45.475 --> 00:08:48.170
After about two weeks
of volunteering at the high school,

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.655
I realized that the youth
that I was trying to reach,

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:53.102
they weren't going to high school.

00:08:53.102 --> 00:08:55.801
I started to walk in the community,

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:59.189
and it didn't take a rocket scientist
to realize that they weren't out

00:08:59.189 --> 00:09:01.836
during the day.

00:09:01.836 --> 00:09:06.471
So I started to walk the streets
at night, late at night,

00:09:06.471 --> 00:09:09.110
going into the parks where they were,

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.238
building the relationship
that was necessary.

00:09:12.238 --> 00:09:17.210
A tragedy happened in Boston
that brought a number of clergy together,

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.204
and there was a small cadre of us
who came to the realization

00:09:21.204 --> 00:09:24.189
that we had to come out
of the four walls of our sanctuary

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:25.868
and meet the youth where they were,

00:09:25.868 --> 00:09:29.325
and not try to figure out
how to bring them in.

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:32.439
And so we decided to walk together,

00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:34.420
and we would get together

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.152
in one of the most dangerous
neighborhoods in the city

00:09:37.152 --> 00:09:39.567
on a Friday night and on a Saturday night

00:09:39.567 --> 00:09:41.529
at 10 p.m.,

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:44.390
and we would walk
until 2 or 3 in the morning.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.612
I imagine we were quite the anomaly
when we first started walking.

00:09:47.612 --> 00:09:49.934
I mean, we weren't drug dealers.

00:09:49.934 --> 00:09:51.809
We weren't drug customers.

00:09:51.809 --> 00:09:54.566
We weren't the police. Some of us
would have collars on.

00:09:54.566 --> 00:09:57.143
It was probably a really odd thing.

00:09:57.143 --> 00:10:00.347
But they started speaking
to us after a while,

00:10:00.347 --> 00:10:02.274
and what we found out is that

00:10:02.274 --> 00:10:05.963
while we were walking,
they were watching us,

00:10:05.963 --> 00:10:08.500
and they wanted to make sure
of a couple of things:

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.671
that number one, we were going
to be consistent in our behavior,

00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:15.384
that we would keep coming out there;

00:10:15.384 --> 00:10:17.575
and then secondly,
they had wanted to make sure

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:20.130
that we weren't out there to exploit them.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.410
Because there was always
somebody who would say,

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.274
"We're going to take back the streets,"

00:10:24.274 --> 00:10:27.398
but they would always seem to have
a television camera with them,

00:10:27.398 --> 00:10:29.231
or a reporter,

00:10:29.231 --> 00:10:31.739
and they would enhance
their own reputation

00:10:31.739 --> 00:10:34.246
to the detriment of those on the streets.

00:10:34.246 --> 00:10:36.801
So when they saw that we had none of that,

00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:39.110
they decided to talk to us.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.255
And then we did
an amazing thing for preachers.

00:10:43.255 --> 00:10:47.352
We decided to listen and not preach.

00:10:47.352 --> 00:10:49.223
Come on, give it up for me.

00:10:49.223 --> 00:10:52.682
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:52.682 --> 00:10:56.792
All right, come on, you're cutting
into my time now, okay? (Laughter)

00:10:56.792 --> 00:10:58.612
But it was amazing.

00:10:58.612 --> 00:11:04.919
We said to them, "We don't know
our own communities after 9 p.m. at night,

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:07.759
between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.,

00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:08.809
but you do.

00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:14.551
You are the subject matter experts,
if you will, of that period of time.

00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:17.387
So talk to us. Teach us.

00:11:17.387 --> 00:11:19.477
Help us to see what we're not seeing.

00:11:19.477 --> 00:11:23.262
Help us to understand
what we're not understanding."

00:11:23.262 --> 00:11:25.677
And they were all too happy to do that,

00:11:25.677 --> 00:11:30.436
and we got an idea of what life
on the streets was all about,

00:11:30.436 --> 00:11:34.244
very different than what you see
on the 11 o'clock news,

00:11:34.244 --> 00:11:40.480
very different than what is portrayed
in popular media and even social media.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.696
And as we were talking with them,

00:11:42.696 --> 00:11:46.899
a number of myths were dispelled
about them with us.

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:53.576
And one of the biggest myths was
that these kids were cold and heartless

00:11:53.576 --> 00:11:57.440
and uncharacteristically bold
in their violence.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.737
What we found out was the exact opposite.

00:12:00.737 --> 00:12:03.477
Most of the young people
who were out there on the streets

00:12:03.477 --> 00:12:06.542
are just trying to make it on the streets.

00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:08.492
And we also found out

00:12:08.492 --> 00:12:12.052
that some of the most
intelligent and creative

00:12:12.052 --> 00:12:18.979
and magnificent and wise

00:12:18.979 --> 00:12:21.472
people that we've ever met

00:12:21.472 --> 00:12:25.657
were on the street,
engaged in a struggle.

00:12:26.247 --> 00:12:30.390
And I know some of them call it survival,
but I call them overcomers,

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.430
because when you're in
the conditions that they're in,

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.609
to be able to live every day
is an accomplishment of overcoming.

00:12:39.669 --> 00:12:41.823
And as a result of that, we said to them,

00:12:41.823 --> 00:12:45.271
"How do you see this church,
how do you see this institution

00:12:45.271 --> 00:12:48.312
helping this situation?"

00:12:48.312 --> 00:12:52.120
And we developed a plan
in conversation with these youths.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.764
We stopped looking at them
as the problem to be solved,

00:12:56.764 --> 00:13:01.942
and we started looking at them
as partners, as assets,

00:13:01.942 --> 00:13:07.654
as co-laborers in the struggle
to reduce violence in the community.

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:09.836
Imagine developing a plan,

00:13:09.836 --> 00:13:14.945
you have one minister at one table
and a heroin dealer at the other table,

00:13:14.945 --> 00:13:20.417
coming up with a way in which the church
can help the entire community.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.788
The Boston Miracle was about
bringing people together.

00:13:25.788 --> 00:13:27.645
We had other partners.

00:13:27.645 --> 00:13:29.248
We had law enforcement partners.

00:13:29.248 --> 00:13:32.160
We had police officers.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.310
It wasn't the entire force,

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:39.000
because there were still some who still
had that lock-'em-up mentality,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.136
but there were other cops

00:13:41.136 --> 00:13:46.221
who saw the honor in partnering
with the community,

00:13:46.221 --> 00:13:49.407
who saw the responsibility from themselves

00:13:49.407 --> 00:13:55.960
to be able to work as partners
with community leaders and faith leaders

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.490
in order to reduce violence
in the community.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.941
Same with probation officers,

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:02.822
same with judges,

00:14:02.822 --> 00:14:06.560
same with folks who were
up that law enforcement chain,

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.743
because they realized, like we did,

00:14:08.743 --> 00:14:12.435
that we'll never arrest ourselves
out of this situation,

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:18.314
that there will not be
enough prosecutions made,

00:14:18.314 --> 00:14:23.762
and you cannot fill these jails up enough

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:26.947
in order to alleviate the problem.

00:14:27.897 --> 00:14:31.637
I helped to start an organization

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:36.443
20 years ago, a faith-based organization,
to deal with this issue.

00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:39.740
I left it about four years ago

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.840
and started working in cities
across the United States,

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.779
19 in total,

00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:47.599
and what I found out
was that in those cities,

00:14:47.599 --> 00:14:52.429
there was always this component
of community leaders

00:14:52.429 --> 00:14:56.724
who put their heads down
and their nose to the grindstone,

00:14:56.724 --> 00:14:59.690
who checked their egos at the door

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.947
and saw the whole as greater
than the sum of its parts,

00:15:02.947 --> 00:15:08.566
and came together and found ways
to work with youth out on the streets,

00:15:08.566 --> 00:15:13.349
that the solution is not more cops,

00:15:13.349 --> 00:15:18.643
but the solution is mining the assets
that are there in the community,

00:15:18.643 --> 00:15:22.381
to have a strong community component

00:15:22.381 --> 00:15:27.373
in the collaboration
around violence reduction.

00:15:27.373 --> 00:15:31.705
Now, there is a movement
in the United States

00:15:31.705 --> 00:15:38.299
of young people who I am very proud of
who are dealing with the structural issues

00:15:38.299 --> 00:15:42.756
that need to change if we're going
to be a better society.

00:15:42.756 --> 00:15:47.655
But there is this political ploy
to try to pit police brutality

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:52.693
and police misconduct
against black-on-black violence.

00:15:52.693 --> 00:15:54.597
But it's a fiction.

00:15:54.597 --> 00:15:56.617
It's all connected.

00:15:56.617 --> 00:16:01.331
When you think about decades
of failed housing policies

00:16:01.331 --> 00:16:05.208
and poor educational structures,

00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:08.482
when you think about
persistent unemployment

00:16:08.482 --> 00:16:11.360
and underemployment in a community,

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.124
when you think about poor healthcare,

00:16:14.124 --> 00:16:17.300
and then you throw drugs into the mix

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.348
and duffel bags full of guns,

00:16:19.348 --> 00:16:24.782
little wonder that you would see
this culture of violence emerge.

00:16:24.782 --> 00:16:29.140
And then the response that comes
from the state is more cops

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.296
and more suppression of hot spots.

00:16:32.296 --> 00:16:34.562
It's all connected,

00:16:34.562 --> 00:16:38.340
and one of the wonderful things
that we've been able to do

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:43.473
is to be able to show the value
of partnering together --

00:16:43.473 --> 00:16:49.039
community, law enforcement,
private sector, the city --

00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:50.427
in order to reduce violence.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:54.064
You have to value
that community component.

00:16:54.534 --> 00:17:00.640
I believe that we can end
the era of violence in our cities.

00:17:01.154 --> 00:17:06.488
I believe that it is possible
and that people are doing it even now.

00:17:07.144 --> 00:17:08.497
But I need your help.

00:17:09.537 --> 00:17:14.186
It can't just come from folks
who are burning themselves out

00:17:14.186 --> 00:17:15.744
in the community.

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:18.742
They need support. They need help.

00:17:18.742 --> 00:17:20.680
Go back to your city.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.259
Find those people.

00:17:22.259 --> 00:17:24.976
"You need some help? I'll help you out."

00:17:24.976 --> 00:17:28.180
Find those people. They're there.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:33.537
Bring them together with law enforcement,
the private sector, and the city,

00:17:33.537 --> 00:17:36.400
with the one aim of reducing violence,

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.346
but make sure that
that community component is strong.

00:17:40.346 --> 00:17:43.667
Because the old adage
that comes from Burundi is right:

00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:51.410
that you do for me,
without me, you do to me.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.535
God bless you. Thank you.

00:17:53.535 --> 00:17:57.535
(Applause)
