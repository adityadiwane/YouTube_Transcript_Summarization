00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.489
Three years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:19.115
from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.

00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:22.262
My Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation,

00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:23.850
was going berserk,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.297
and the closer I got, the more frenetic it became,

00:00:27.297 --> 00:00:30.093
and frantic. My God.

00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:32.843
I was there covering the 25th anniversary

00:00:32.843 --> 00:00:35.993
of the world's worst nuclear accident,

00:00:35.993 --> 00:00:37.942
as you can see by the look on my face,

00:00:37.942 --> 00:00:40.833
reluctantly so, but with good reason,

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:44.296
because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:48.712
back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation

00:00:48.712 --> 00:00:50.928
as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima,

00:00:50.928 --> 00:00:53.402
and the sarcophagus, which is the covering

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:54.979
over reactor number four,

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.861
which was hastily built 27 years ago,

00:00:57.861 --> 00:00:59.779
now sits cracked and rusted

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:01.495
and leaking radiation.

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.173
So I was filming.

00:01:03.173 --> 00:01:04.479
I just wanted to get the job done

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.066
and get out of there fast.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.350
But then, I looked into the distance,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.627
and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse,

00:01:12.627 --> 00:01:15.170
and I'm thinking, who could be living here?

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.762
I mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air,

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:21.472
are among the most highly contaminated on Earth,

00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:23.090
and the reactor sits at the the center of

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.736
a tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone,

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:30.081
and it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards.

00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:32.628
You have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away,

00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:34.549
you have to have a government minder,

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.185
and there's draconian radiation rules

00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:41.890
and constant contamination monitoring.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.042
The point being, no human being

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:46.928
should be living anywhere near the dead zone.

00:01:46.928 --> 00:01:48.521
But they are.

00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:51.174
It turns out an unlikely community

00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:54.627
of some 200 people are living inside the zone.

00:01:54.627 --> 00:01:56.485
They're called self-settlers.

00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:59.125
And almost all of them are women,

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:00.993
the men having shorter lifespans

00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:03.310
in part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.298
if not radiation.

00:02:05.298 --> 00:02:07.536
Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated

00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:09.156
at the time of the accident,

00:02:09.156 --> 00:02:11.617
but not everybody accepted that fate.

00:02:11.617 --> 00:02:14.410
The women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.405
are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities

00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:19.355
and, it would seem, common sense,

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:23.045
and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone.

00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:25.529
They did so illegally.

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.446
As one woman put it to a soldier

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:30.260
who was trying to evacuate her for a second time,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.083
"Shoot me and dig the grave.

00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:34.661
Otherwise, I'm going home."

00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:37.196
Now why would they return to such deadly soil?

00:02:37.196 --> 00:02:39.104
I mean, were they unaware of the risks

00:02:39.104 --> 00:02:42.115
or crazy enough to ignore them, or both?

00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:43.587
The thing is, they see their lives

00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:47.119
and the risks they run decidedly differently.

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.372
Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages,

00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:54.703
eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic,

00:02:54.703 --> 00:02:56.626
totally contaminated.

00:02:56.626 --> 00:02:59.765
Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident,

00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:01.798
but a few are left like this,

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:05.351
kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.662
Others have a few residents in them,

00:03:07.662 --> 00:03:10.127
one or two "babushkas," or "babas,"

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:13.316
which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother.

00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:16.399
Another village might have six or seven residents.

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:19.129
So this is the strange demographic of the zone --

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.998
isolated alone together.

00:03:21.998 --> 00:03:24.201
And when I made my way to that piping chimney

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:25.872
I'd seen in the distance,

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:29.118
I saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her.

00:03:29.118 --> 00:03:32.184
She's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village,

00:03:32.184 --> 00:03:34.146
population eight.

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.109
(Laughter)

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.342
And she said to me, when I asked her the obvious,

00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:43.351
"Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does."

00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:44.984
And you have to remember, these women have

00:03:44.984 --> 00:03:48.852
survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century.

00:03:48.852 --> 00:03:52.423
Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor,

00:03:52.423 --> 00:03:54.254
killed millions of Ukrainians,

00:03:54.254 --> 00:03:56.277
and they faced the Nazis in the '40s,

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:59.253
who came through slashing, burning, raping,

00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:00.869
and in fact many of these women

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:03.954
were shipped to Germany as forced labor.

00:04:03.954 --> 00:04:06.414
So when a couple decades into Soviet rule,

00:04:06.414 --> 00:04:07.609
Chernobyl happened,

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.671
they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy

00:04:10.671 --> 00:04:12.849
that was invisible.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.838
So they returned to their villages

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:18.058
and are told they're going to get sick and die soon,

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:20.623
but five happy years, their logic goes,

00:04:20.623 --> 00:04:23.178
is better than 10 stuck in a high rise

00:04:23.178 --> 00:04:25.038
on the outskirts of Kiev,

00:04:25.038 --> 00:04:27.216
separated from the graves of their mothers

00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:29.536
and fathers and babies,

00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:33.492
the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon.

00:04:33.492 --> 00:04:35.890
For them, environmental contamination

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.440
may not be the worst sort of devastation.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.760
It turns out this holds true

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.851
for other species as well.

00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:44.798
Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned

00:04:44.798 --> 00:04:46.548
to the region in force,

00:04:46.548 --> 00:04:49.803
the very real, very negative effects of radiation

00:04:49.803 --> 00:04:53.361
being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus

00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:55.112
of humans.

00:04:55.112 --> 00:04:59.805
The dead zone, it turns out, is full of life.

00:04:59.805 --> 00:05:02.863
And there is a kind of heroic resilience,

00:05:02.863 --> 00:05:05.734
a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those

00:05:05.734 --> 00:05:08.226
who start their day at 5 a.m.

00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:10.469
pulling water from a well

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:12.173
and end it at midnight

00:05:12.173 --> 00:05:14.237
poised to beat a bucket with a stick

00:05:14.237 --> 00:05:17.137
and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes,

00:05:17.137 --> 00:05:22.289
their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka.

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.699
And there's a patina of simple defiance among them.

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.537
"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?"

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.239
I mean, what about their health?

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:34.061
The benefits of hardy, physical living,

00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:35.665
but an environment made toxic

00:05:35.665 --> 00:05:39.648
by a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation.

00:05:39.648 --> 00:05:41.783
It's incredibly difficult to parse.

00:05:41.783 --> 00:05:43.600
Health studies from the region

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.340
are conflicting and fraught.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.733
The World Health Organization

00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:50.463
puts the number of Chernobyl-related deaths

00:05:50.463 --> 00:05:52.781
at 4,000, eventually.

00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:55.419
Greenpeace and other organizations

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.577
put that number in the tens of thousands.

00:05:58.577 --> 00:06:01.569
Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.186
are sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees

00:06:04.186 --> 00:06:07.253
suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere:

00:06:07.253 --> 00:06:10.531
higher levels of anxiety, depression, alcoholism,

00:06:10.531 --> 00:06:12.711
unemployment and, importantly,

00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:15.954
disrupted social networks.

00:06:15.954 --> 00:06:18.360
Now, like many of you,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.985
I have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life.

00:06:22.985 --> 00:06:26.407
Home is a transient concept.

00:06:26.407 --> 00:06:28.584
I have a deeper connection to my laptop

00:06:28.584 --> 00:06:32.926
than any bit of soil.

00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:35.165
So it's hard for us to understand, but home

00:06:35.165 --> 00:06:38.338
is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka,

00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:41.794
and connection to the land is palpable.

00:06:41.794 --> 00:06:43.585
And perhaps because these Ukrainian women

00:06:43.585 --> 00:06:45.588
were schooled under the Soviets

00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:47.830
and versed in the Russian poets,

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.388
aphorisms about these ideas

00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:51.585
slip from their mouths all the time.

00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:54.592
"If you leave, you die."

00:06:54.592 --> 00:06:56.559
"Those who left are worse off now.

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:58.200
They are dying of sadness."

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.687
"Motherland is motherland. I will never leave."

00:07:02.687 --> 00:07:05.943
What sounds like faith, soft faith,

00:07:05.943 --> 00:07:09.068
may actually be fact,

00:07:09.068 --> 00:07:10.690
because the surprising truth --

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.076
I mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be

00:07:13.076 --> 00:07:15.648
that these women who returned to their homes

00:07:15.648 --> 00:07:17.728
and have lived on some of the most radioactive land

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.934
on Earth for the last 27 years,

00:07:19.934 --> 00:07:22.289
have actually outlived their counterparts

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:24.336
who accepted relocation,

00:07:24.336 --> 00:07:28.462
by some estimates up to 10 years.

00:07:28.462 --> 00:07:30.642
How could this be?

00:07:30.642 --> 00:07:32.341
Here's a theory: Could it be

00:07:32.341 --> 00:07:35.406
that those ties to ancestral soil,

00:07:35.406 --> 00:07:37.972
the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms,

00:07:37.972 --> 00:07:40.836
actually affect longevity?

00:07:40.836 --> 00:07:42.595
The power of motherland

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:45.053
so fundamental to that part of the world

00:07:45.053 --> 00:07:46.865
seems palliative.

00:07:46.865 --> 00:07:49.662
Home and community are forces

00:07:49.662 --> 00:07:53.722
that rival even radiation.

00:07:53.722 --> 00:07:56.200
Now radiation or not,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.804
these women are at the end of their lives.

00:07:58.804 --> 00:08:02.797
In the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone,

00:08:02.797 --> 00:08:07.024
and it will revert to a wild, radioactive place,

00:08:07.024 --> 00:08:10.138
full only of animals and occasionally

00:08:10.138 --> 00:08:13.230
daring, flummoxed scientists.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.332
But the spirit and existence of the babushkas,

00:08:16.332 --> 00:08:18.039
whose numbers have been halved

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.181
in the three years I've known them,

00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:22.379
will leave us with powerful new templates

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:24.395
to think about and grapple with,

00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:28.058
about the relative nature of risk,

00:08:28.058 --> 00:08:31.905
about transformative connections to home,

00:08:31.905 --> 00:08:35.451
and about the magnificent tonic

00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:39.304
of personal agency and self-determination.

00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:41.239
Thank you.

00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:45.239
(Applause)
