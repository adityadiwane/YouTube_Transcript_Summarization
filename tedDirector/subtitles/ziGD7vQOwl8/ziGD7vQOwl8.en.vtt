00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:13.819
So I wanted to tell a story

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:17.291
that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book,

00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:20.838
and it's a story of something that happened

00:00:20.838 --> 00:00:22.411
3,000 years ago,

00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:25.638
when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.

00:00:25.638 --> 00:00:28.370
And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.700
in what is now Israel.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.948
And the reason the story obsessed me is that

00:00:32.948 --> 00:00:36.034
I thought I understood it, and then I went back over it

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:40.140
and I realized that I didn't understand it at all.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.957
Ancient Palestine had a -- along its eastern border,

00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:46.273
there's a mountain range.

00:00:46.273 --> 00:00:48.132
Still same is true of Israel today.

00:00:48.132 --> 00:00:51.065
And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:55.523
of that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.

00:00:55.523 --> 00:00:57.748
And then there's a coastal plain

00:00:57.748 --> 00:01:01.103
along the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.

00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:04.503
And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain

00:01:04.503 --> 00:01:06.436
is an area called the Shephelah,

00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:10.855
which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west,

00:01:10.855 --> 00:01:14.034
and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelah

00:01:14.034 --> 00:01:16.787
to get from the coastal plain to the mountains.

00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:18.481
And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know

00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:20.889
it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:23.807
It's gorgeous, with forests of oak

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:26.222
and wheat fields and vineyards.

00:01:26.222 --> 00:01:29.601
But more importantly, though, in the history of that region,

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:33.366
it's served, it's had a real strategic function,

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:36.279
and that is, it is the means by which hostile armies

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:38.862
on the coastal plain find their way,

00:01:38.862 --> 00:01:42.484
get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:45.511
And 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.

00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:49.788
The Philistines, who are the biggest of enemies

00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:51.290
of the Kingdom of Israel,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.002
are living in the coastal plain.

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:56.298
They're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people.

00:01:56.298 --> 00:01:58.721
And they may start to make their way

00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:00.961
through one of the valleys of the Shephelah

00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:02.128
up into the mountains,

00:02:02.128 --> 00:02:04.384
because what they want to do is occupy the highland area

00:02:04.384 --> 00:02:08.385
right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.

00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:11.650
And the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.383
obviously catches wind of this,

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:16.252
and Saul brings his army down from the mountains

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:19.907
and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah,

00:02:19.907 --> 00:02:22.365
one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:25.233
And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge,

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:29.490
and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.225
and the two armies just sit there for weeks

00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:34.347
and stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.

00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:36.820
Neither can attack the other, because to attack the other side

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.076
you've got to come down the mountain into the valley

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.593
and then up the other side, and you're completely exposed.

00:02:42.593 --> 00:02:44.785
So finally, to break the deadlock,

00:02:44.785 --> 00:02:47.999
the Philistines send their mightiest warrior

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.476
down into the valley floor, and he calls out

00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:51.932
and he says to the Israelites,

00:02:51.932 --> 00:02:54.560
"Send your mightiest warrior down,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.567
and we'll have this out, just the two of us."

00:02:56.567 --> 00:03:00.402
This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.

00:03:00.402 --> 00:03:02.197
It was a way of settling disputes

00:03:02.197 --> 00:03:06.321
without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.

00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:09.281
And the Philistine who is sent down,

00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.448
their mighty warrior, is a giant.

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:13.223
He's 6 foot 9.

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:17.936
He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor,

00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:20.995
and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin

00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:23.723
and he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying.

00:03:23.723 --> 00:03:28.213
And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.

00:03:28.213 --> 00:03:32.848
It's a death wish, right? There's no way they think they can take him.

00:03:32.848 --> 00:03:35.141
And finally the only person who will come forward

00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:37.652
is this young shepherd boy,

00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:40.330
and he goes up to Saul and he says, "I'll fight him."

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.448
And Saul says, "You can't fight him. That's ridiculous.

00:03:43.448 --> 00:03:45.770
You're this kid. This is this mighty warrior."

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.193
But the shepherd is adamant. He says, "No, no, no,

00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:51.186
you don't understand, I have been defending my flock

00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:55.355
against lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it."

00:03:55.355 --> 00:03:58.569
And Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:59.910
So he says, "All right."

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.122
And then he turns to the kid, and he says,

00:04:01.122 --> 00:04:04.816
"But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are."

00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:07.219
So he tries to give the shepherd his armor,

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:08.470
and the shepherd says, "No."

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.883
He says, "I can't wear this stuff."

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:14.957
The Biblical verse is, "I cannot wear this for I have not proved it,"

00:04:14.957 --> 00:04:18.134
meaning, "I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy."

00:04:18.134 --> 00:04:20.740
So he reaches down instead on the ground

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.495
and picks up five stones

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:24.956
and puts them in his shepherd's bag

00:04:24.956 --> 00:04:29.468
and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.

00:04:29.468 --> 00:04:31.674
And the giant sees this figure approaching,

00:04:31.674 --> 00:04:34.817
and calls out, "Come to me so I can feed your flesh

00:04:34.817 --> 00:04:38.794
to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field."

00:04:38.794 --> 00:04:42.229
He issues this kind of taunt towards this person

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.964
coming to fight him.

00:04:43.964 --> 00:04:47.310
And the shepherd draws closer and closer,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.298
and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.

00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:51.470
That's all he's carrying.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.338
Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff,

00:04:53.338 --> 00:04:55.910
and he says -- he's insulted --

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.267
"Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?"

00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:02.330
And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.570
out of his pocket, puts it in his sling

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.865
and rolls it around and lets it fly

00:05:07.865 --> 00:05:10.266
and it hits the giant right between the eyes --

00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:12.364
right here, in his most vulnerable spot --

00:05:12.364 --> 00:05:15.685
and he falls down either dead or unconscious,

00:05:15.685 --> 00:05:18.179
and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:19.865
and cuts off his head,

00:05:19.865 --> 00:05:25.416
and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run.

00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:29.777
And of course, the name of the giant is Goliath

00:05:29.777 --> 00:05:32.306
and the name of the shepherd boy is David,

00:05:32.306 --> 00:05:35.436
and the reason that story has obsessed me

00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:36.874
over the course of writing my book

00:05:36.874 --> 00:05:39.966
is that everything I thought I knew about that story

00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:42.717
turned out to be wrong.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:46.505
So David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?

00:05:46.505 --> 00:05:48.642
In fact, that term, David and Goliath,

00:05:48.642 --> 00:05:51.623
has entered our language as a metaphor for

00:05:51.623 --> 00:05:53.161
improbable victories

00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:56.272
by some weak party over someone far stronger.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.462
Now why do we call David an underdog?

00:05:58.462 --> 00:06:01.937
Well, we call him an underdog because he's a kid,

00:06:01.937 --> 00:06:05.473
a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.

00:06:05.473 --> 00:06:07.128
We also call him an underdog

00:06:07.128 --> 00:06:11.050
because Goliath is an experienced warrior,

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.986
and David is just a shepherd.

00:06:12.986 --> 00:06:15.336
But most importantly, we call him an underdog

00:06:15.336 --> 00:06:20.346
because all he has is -- it's that Goliath is outfitted with

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:22.351
all of this modern weaponry,

00:06:22.351 --> 00:06:24.127
this glittering coat of armor

00:06:24.127 --> 00:06:27.962
and a sword and a javelin and a spear,

00:06:27.962 --> 00:06:31.792
and all David has is this sling.

00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:33.490
Well, let's start there with the phrase

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.934
"All David has is this sling,"

00:06:35.934 --> 00:06:38.801
because that's the first mistake that we make.

00:06:38.801 --> 00:06:42.358
In ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.

00:06:42.358 --> 00:06:45.789
There's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:48.915
There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers,

00:06:48.915 --> 00:06:51.805
armed foot soldiers with swords and shields

00:06:51.805 --> 00:06:53.305
and some kind of armor.

00:06:53.305 --> 00:06:56.533
And there's artillery, and artillery are archers,

00:06:56.533 --> 00:06:58.705
but, more importantly, slingers.

00:06:58.705 --> 00:07:01.766
And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch

00:07:01.766 --> 00:07:04.563
with two long cords attached to it,

00:07:04.563 --> 00:07:07.765
and they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball,

00:07:07.765 --> 00:07:10.886
inside the pouch, and they whirl it around like this

00:07:10.886 --> 00:07:13.529
and they let one of the cords go,

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:17.399
and the effect is to send the projectile forward

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:20.704
towards its target.

00:07:20.704 --> 00:07:23.439
That's what David has, and it's important to understand

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:26.286
that that sling is not a slingshot.

00:07:26.286 --> 00:07:28.905
It's not this, right? It's not a child's toy.

00:07:28.905 --> 00:07:32.730
It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.706
When David rolls it around like this,

00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:38.935
he's turning the sling around probably

00:07:38.935 --> 00:07:41.607
at six or seven revolutions per second,

00:07:41.607 --> 00:07:45.452
and that means that when the rock is released,

00:07:45.452 --> 00:07:47.652
it's going forward really fast,

00:07:47.652 --> 00:07:49.425
probably 35 meters per second.

00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:52.990
That's substantially faster than a baseball

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.623
thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.

00:07:56.623 --> 00:08:00.506
More than that, the stones in the Valley of Elah

00:08:00.506 --> 00:08:03.162
were not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate,

00:08:03.162 --> 00:08:06.481
which are rocks twice the density of normal stones.

00:08:06.481 --> 00:08:09.118
If you do the calculations on the ballistics,

00:08:09.118 --> 00:08:13.002
on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling,

00:08:13.002 --> 00:08:15.323
it's roughly equal to the stopping power

00:08:15.323 --> 00:08:18.880
of a [.45 caliber] handgun.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.874
This is an incredibly devastating weapon.

00:08:21.874 --> 00:08:26.472
Accuracy, we know from historical records

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:30.970
that slingers -- experienced slingers could hit

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:36.993
and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.

00:08:36.993 --> 00:08:39.963
From medieval tapestries, we know that slingers

00:08:39.963 --> 00:08:42.321
were capable of hitting birds in flight.

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:44.755
They were incredibly accurate.

00:08:44.755 --> 00:08:48.312
When David lines up -- and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath,

00:08:48.312 --> 00:08:49.921
he's quite close to Goliath --

00:08:49.921 --> 00:08:53.336
when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath,

00:08:53.336 --> 00:08:56.398
he has every intention and every expectation

00:08:56.398 --> 00:08:59.101
of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot

00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:00.429
between his eyes.

00:09:00.429 --> 00:09:02.445
If you go back over the history of ancient warfare,

00:09:02.445 --> 00:09:05.257
you will find time and time again

00:09:05.257 --> 00:09:09.260
that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:14.285
in one kind of battle or another.

00:09:14.285 --> 00:09:18.181
So what's Goliath? He's heavy infantry,

00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:23.380
and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.235
is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.

00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:29.406
When he says, "Come to me that I might

00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:32.358
feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"

00:09:32.358 --> 00:09:34.358
the key phrase is "Come to me."

00:09:34.358 --> 00:09:36.496
Come up to me because we're going to fight,

00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:38.207
hand to hand, like this.

00:09:38.207 --> 00:09:40.335
Saul has the same expectation.

00:09:40.335 --> 00:09:42.694
David says, "I want to fight Goliath,"

00:09:42.694 --> 00:09:44.515
and Saul tries to give him his armor,

00:09:44.515 --> 00:09:47.242
because Saul is thinking, "Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,'

00:09:47.242 --> 00:09:50.509
you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,'

00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:52.697
infantry on infantry."

00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:55.671
But David has absolutely no expectation.

00:09:55.671 --> 00:09:58.222
He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he?

00:09:58.222 --> 00:10:01.230
He's a shepherd. He's spent his entire career

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.443
using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.

00:10:05.443 --> 00:10:07.193
That's where his strength lies.

00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:09.725
So here he is, this shepherd, experienced

00:10:09.725 --> 00:10:11.764
in the use of a devastating weapon,

00:10:11.764 --> 00:10:14.158
up against this lumbering giant

00:10:14.158 --> 00:10:17.458
weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor

00:10:17.458 --> 00:10:18.959
and these incredibly heavy weapons

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:22.056
that are useful only in short-range combat.

00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:26.793
Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.599
So why do we keep calling David an underdog,

00:10:29.599 --> 00:10:35.423
and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable?

00:10:35.423 --> 00:10:38.263
There's a second piece of this that's important.

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:41.661
It's not just that we misunderstand David

00:10:41.661 --> 00:10:43.566
and his choice of weaponry.

00:10:43.566 --> 00:10:46.905
It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.

00:10:46.905 --> 00:10:50.139
Goliath is not what he seems to be.

00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:54.127
There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text,

00:10:54.127 --> 00:10:56.932
things that are in retrospect quite puzzling

00:10:56.932 --> 00:11:00.709
and don't square with his image as this mighty warrior.

00:11:00.709 --> 00:11:04.086
So to begin with, the Bible says that Goliath

00:11:04.086 --> 00:11:08.051
is led onto the valley floor by an attendant.

00:11:08.051 --> 00:11:10.260
Now that is weird, right?

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.390
Here is this mighty warrior

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.197
challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.

00:11:15.197 --> 00:11:17.909
Why is he being led by the hand

00:11:17.909 --> 00:11:20.959
by some young boy, presumably,

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:23.421
to the point of combat?

00:11:23.421 --> 00:11:27.775
Secondly, the Bible story makes special note

00:11:27.775 --> 00:11:30.864
of how slowly Goliath moves,

00:11:30.864 --> 00:11:32.890
another odd thing to say when you're describing

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.940
the mightiest warrior known to man at that point.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.763
And then there's this whole weird thing

00:11:38.763 --> 00:11:42.575
about how long it takes Goliath to react

00:11:42.575 --> 00:11:44.571
to the sight of David.

00:11:44.571 --> 00:11:47.349
So David's coming down the mountain,

00:11:47.349 --> 00:11:51.286
and he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.

00:11:51.286 --> 00:11:53.254
There is nothing about him that says,

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.288
"I am about to fight you like this."

00:11:55.288 --> 00:11:57.019
He's not even carrying a sword.

00:11:57.019 --> 00:11:59.701
Why does Goliath not react to that?

00:11:59.701 --> 00:12:03.929
It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day.

00:12:03.929 --> 00:12:07.876
And then there's that strange comment he makes to David:

00:12:07.876 --> 00:12:12.171
"Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"

00:12:12.171 --> 00:12:15.994
Sticks? David only has one stick.

00:12:15.994 --> 00:12:18.253
Well, it turns out that there's been a great deal

00:12:18.253 --> 00:12:21.294
of speculation within the medical community over the years

00:12:21.294 --> 00:12:23.820
about whether there is something

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.709
fundamentally wrong with Goliath,

00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:30.118
an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.

00:12:30.118 --> 00:12:31.280
There have been many articles written.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.274
The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal,

00:12:35.274 --> 00:12:37.629
and it started a chain of speculation

00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:40.752
that starts with an explanation for Goliath's height.

00:12:40.752 --> 00:12:43.675
So Goliath is head and shoulders above

00:12:43.675 --> 00:12:45.837
all of his peers in that era,

00:12:45.837 --> 00:12:49.819
and usually when someone is that far out of the norm,

00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:51.416
there's an explanation for it.

00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:54.649
So the most common form of giantism

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:57.384
is a condition called acromegaly,

00:12:57.384 --> 00:13:00.287
and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor

00:13:00.287 --> 00:13:02.790
on your pituitary gland

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.506
that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.

00:13:05.506 --> 00:13:09.065
And throughout history, many of the most famous giants

00:13:09.065 --> 00:13:10.834
have all had acromegaly.

00:13:10.834 --> 00:13:12.898
So the tallest person of all time

00:13:12.898 --> 00:13:14.465
was a guy named Robert Wadlow

00:13:14.465 --> 00:13:17.516
who was still growing when he died at the age of 24

00:13:17.516 --> 00:13:20.405
and he was 8 foot 11.

00:13:20.405 --> 00:13:21.819
He had acromegaly.

00:13:21.819 --> 00:13:24.354
Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant?

00:13:24.354 --> 00:13:26.037
Famous. He had acromegaly.

00:13:26.037 --> 00:13:30.576
There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:31.654
Anyone who's unusually tall,

00:13:31.654 --> 00:13:34.407
that's the first explanation we come up with.

00:13:34.407 --> 00:13:38.402
And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects

00:13:38.402 --> 00:13:39.627
associated with it,

00:13:39.627 --> 00:13:43.189
principally having to do with vision.

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:46.485
The pituitary tumor, as it grows,

00:13:46.485 --> 00:13:50.533
often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain,

00:13:50.533 --> 00:13:53.037
with the result that people with acromegaly

00:13:53.037 --> 00:13:58.508
have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.

00:13:58.508 --> 00:14:01.101
So when people have started to speculate

00:14:01.101 --> 00:14:04.332
about what might have been wrong with Goliath,

00:14:04.332 --> 00:14:05.243
they've said, "Wait a minute,

00:14:05.243 --> 00:14:08.433
he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone

00:14:08.433 --> 00:14:10.006
who has acromegaly."

00:14:10.006 --> 00:14:12.990
And that would also explain so much of what was strange

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.117
about his behavior that day.

00:14:15.117 --> 00:14:16.938
Why does he move so slowly

00:14:16.938 --> 00:14:20.466
and have to be escorted down into the valley floor

00:14:20.466 --> 00:14:21.825
by an attendant?

00:14:21.825 --> 00:14:24.813
Because he can't make his way on his own.

00:14:24.813 --> 00:14:28.070
Why is he so strangely oblivious to David

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.719
that he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him

00:14:30.719 --> 00:14:32.866
until the very last moment?

00:14:32.866 --> 00:14:35.375
Because he can't see him.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:38.692
When he says, "Come to me that I might feed your flesh

00:14:38.692 --> 00:14:41.188
to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"

00:14:41.188 --> 00:14:45.832
the phrase "come to me" is a hint also of his vulnerability.

00:14:45.832 --> 00:14:48.816
Come to me because I can't see you.

00:14:48.816 --> 00:14:54.030
And then there's, "Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:59.360
He sees two sticks when David has only one.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.324
So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge

00:15:02.324 --> 00:15:04.521
looking down on him thought he was

00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:07.632
this extraordinarily powerful foe.

00:15:07.632 --> 00:15:09.608
What they didn't understand was that

00:15:09.608 --> 00:15:12.905
the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength

00:15:12.905 --> 00:15:16.660
was also the source of his greatest weakness.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.617
And there is, I think, in that,

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:21.822
a very important lesson for all of us.

00:15:21.822 --> 00:15:25.684
Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.

00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:29.173
And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.

00:15:29.173 --> 00:15:30.960
Thank you.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.345
(Applause)
