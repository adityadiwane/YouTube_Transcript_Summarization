00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Last year I showed these two slides so that

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160
demonstrate that the arctic ice cap,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
which for most of the last three million years

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
has been the size of the lower 48 states,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
has shrunk by 40 percent.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
The arctic ice cap is, in a sense,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
the beating heart of the global climate system.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
It expands in winter and contracts in summer.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
The next slide I show you will be

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.160
a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
The permanent ice is marked in red.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
As you see, it expands to the dark blue --

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
that's the annual ice in winter,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
and it contracts in summer.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
you can see is almost like blood,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.160
spilling out of the body here.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.160
In 25 years it's gone from this, to this.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
This is a problem because the warming

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
which, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.160
Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.160
that amount could double if we cross this tipping point.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
methane is actively bubbling up out of the water.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Video: Whoa! (Laughter)

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
Al Gore: She's okay. The question is whether we will be.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
And one reason is, this enormous heat sink

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
heats up Greenland from the north.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
This is an annual melting river.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
But the volumes are much larger than ever.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
If you want to know how sea level rises

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
from land-base ice melting

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
this is where it reaches the sea.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
These flows are increasing very rapidly.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
At the other end of the planet, Antarctica

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
the largest mass of ice on the planet.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
Last month scientists reported the entire continent

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
is now in negative ice balance.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.160
And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
is particularly rapid in its melting.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.160
That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Greenland.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
In the Himalayas, the third largest mass of ice:

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.160
at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
40 percent of all the people in the world

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
get half of their drinking water from that melting flow.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
In the Andes, this glacier is the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
source of drinking water for this city.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
The flows have increased.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
In California there has been a 40 percent

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
decline in the Sierra snowpack.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
This is hitting the reservoirs.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
And the predictions, as you've read, are serious.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
This drying around the world has lead to

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
a dramatic increase in fires.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
And the disasters around the world

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
and unprecedented rate.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
Four times as many in the last 30 years

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
as in the previous 75.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.160
This is a completely unsustainable pattern.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.160
If you look at in the context of history

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.160
you can see what this is doing.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
In the last five years

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
we've added 70 million tons of CO2

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
every 24 hours --

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
25 million tons every day to the oceans.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
from the Americas, extending westward,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
and on either side of the Indian subcontinent,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.160
where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
The biggest single cause of global warming,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.160
along with deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
Oil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
The United States is one of the two

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
largest emitters, along with China.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
But we're beginning to see a sea change.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
with some green alternatives proposed.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160
(Applause)

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
However there is a political battle

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
in our country.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
And the coal industries and the oil industries

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
promoting clean coal,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
which is an oxymoron.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
That image reminded me of something.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
(Laughter)

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Around Christmas, in my home in Tennessee,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
You probably saw it on the news.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160
This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
This happened around Christmas.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
Video: ♪♫ Frosty the coal man is a jolly, happy soul.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
He's abundant here in America,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
and he helps our economy grow.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.160
Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
He's affordable and adorable, and workers keep their pay.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.160
Al Gore: This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.160
The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
Video: Don Blankenship: Let me be clear about it. Al Gore,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.160
Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know what they're talking about.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Climate Protection

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
has launched two campaigns.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160
This is one of them, part of one of them.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
Video: Actor: At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
threat to our business.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
That's why we've made it our primary goal

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
to spend a large sum of money

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
the truth about coal.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
The fact is, coal isn't dirty.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
We think it's clean --

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
smells good, too.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
So don't worry about climate change.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
Leave that up to us.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.160
(Laughter)

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Video: Actor: Clean coal -- you've heard a lot about it.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.160
So let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
Amazing! The machinery is kind of loud.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.160
But that's the sound of clean coal technology.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
the remarkable clean coal technology you see here

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
changes everything.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
Take a good long look: this is today's clean coal technology.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
meshes with our economic challenge

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
and our national security challenge.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
Video: Narrator: America is in crisis -- the economy,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160
national security, the climate crisis.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
The thread that links them all:

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
our addiction to carbon based fuels,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
like dirty coal and foreign oil.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
within 10 years.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
A plan to put America back to work,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
make us more secure, and help stop global warming.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
Repower America. Find out more.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
Al Gore: This is the last one.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
Video: Narrator: It's about repowering America.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.160
Man: Future's over here. Wind, sun, a new energy grid.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
Man #2: New investments to create high-paying jobs.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.160
Narrator: Repower America. It's time to get real.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
Al Gore: There is an old African proverb that says,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
"If you want to go quickly, go alone.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
If you want to go far, go together."

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
We need to go far, quickly.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
Thank you very much.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.160
(Applause)
