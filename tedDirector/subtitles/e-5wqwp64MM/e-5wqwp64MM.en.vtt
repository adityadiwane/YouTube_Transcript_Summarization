00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.327
I want you guys to imagine 
that you're a soldier

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:17.228
running through the battlefield.

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:19.444
Now, you're shot in the leg with a bullet,

00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:21.671
which severs your femoral artery.

00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:23.797
Now, this bleed is extremely traumatic

00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:26.532
and can kill you in less 
than three minutes.

00:00:26.532 --> 00:00:28.600
Unfortunately, by the time that a medic

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.276
actually gets to you,

00:00:30.276 --> 00:00:32.527
what the medic has on his or her belt

00:00:32.527 --> 00:00:34.787
can take five minutes or more,

00:00:34.787 --> 00:00:37.951
with the application of pressure,
to stop that type of bleed.

00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:40.204
Now, this problem is 
not only a huge problem

00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:42.893
for the military, but it's 
also a huge problem

00:00:42.893 --> 00:00:45.875
that's epidemic throughout 
the entire medical field,

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:48.506
which is how do we actually look at wounds

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.307
and how do we stop them quickly

00:00:50.307 --> 00:00:52.668
in a way that can work with the body?

00:00:52.668 --> 00:00:55.481
So now, what I've been working
on for the last four years

00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:58.476
is to develop smart biomaterials,

00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:00.453
which are actually materials that will work

00:01:00.453 --> 00:01:02.635
with the body, helping it to heal

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:06.995
and helping it to allow the 
wounds to heal normally.

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:10.585
So now, before we do this, we 
have to take a much closer look

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:12.743
at actually how does the body work.

00:01:12.743 --> 00:01:14.133
So now, everybody here knows

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.230
that the body is made up of cells.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.947
So the cell is the most basic unit of life.

00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:21.411
But not many people know what else.

00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:23.942
But it actually turns out that your cells

00:01:23.942 --> 00:01:26.686
sit in this mesh of complicated fibers,

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.319
proteins and sugars

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.331
known as the extracellular matrix.

00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:32.160
So now, the ECM

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.190
is actually this mesh that 
holds the cells in place,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.030
provides structure for your tissues,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.476
but it also gives the cells a home.

00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:41.603
It allows them to feel what they're doing,

00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:43.188
where they are, and tells them

00:01:43.188 --> 00:01:45.528
how to act and how to behave.

00:01:45.528 --> 00:01:48.460
And it actually turns out that 
the extracellular matrix

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.423
is different from every 
single part of the body.

00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:52.840
So the ECM in my skin

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.955
is different than the ECM in my liver,

00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:57.733
and the ECM in different 
parts of the same organ

00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:59.941
actually vary, so it's very difficult

00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:01.718
to be able to have a product

00:02:01.718 --> 00:02:04.125
that will react to the 
local extracellular matrix,

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:06.218
which is exactly what we're trying to do.

00:02:06.218 --> 00:02:08.940
So now, for example, 
think of the rainforest.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.325
You have the canopy, 
you have the understory,

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:12.900
and you have the forest floor.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.685
Now, all of these parts of the forest

00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:16.451
are made up of different plants,

00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:18.869
and different animals call them home.

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.180
So just like that, the extracellular matrix

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.972
is incredibly diverse in three dimensions.

00:02:23.972 --> 00:02:26.889
On top of that, the extracellular matrix

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.420
is responsible for all wound healing,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.175
so if you imagine cutting the body,

00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:33.200
you actually have to rebuild

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.157
this very complex ECM

00:02:35.157 --> 00:02:37.200
in order to get it to form again,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.779
and a scar, in fact, is actually

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:42.233
poorly formed extracellular matrix.

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:44.291
So now, behind me is an animation

00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:45.899
of the extracellular matrix.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.555
So as you see, your cells sit 
in this complicated mesh

00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:51.187
and as you move throughout the tissue,

00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:53.268
the extracellular matrix changes.

00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:56.075
So now every other piece 
of technology on the market

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:59.151
can only manage a two-
dimensional approximation

00:02:59.151 --> 00:03:00.906
of the extracellular matrix,

00:03:00.906 --> 00:03:02.694
which means that it doesn't fit in

00:03:02.694 --> 00:03:04.460
with the tissue itself.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.260
So when I was a freshman at NYU,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.464
what I discovered was 
you could actually take

00:03:08.464 --> 00:03:10.985
small pieces of plant-derived polymers

00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:13.639
and reassemble them onto the wound.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.297
So if you have a bleeding 
wound like the one behind me,

00:03:16.297 --> 00:03:18.870
you can actually put 
our material onto this,

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.810
and just like Lego blocks,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.993
it'll reassemble into the local tissue.

00:03:22.993 --> 00:03:24.859
So that means if you put it onto liver,

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.610
it turns into something 
that looks like liver,

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.133
and if you put it onto skin,

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:30.236
it turns into something 
that looks just like skin.

00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:31.616
So when you put the gel on,

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:34.927
it actually reassembles 
into this local tissue.

00:03:34.927 --> 00:03:38.533
So now, this has a whole 
bunch of applications,

00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:41.485
but basically the idea is,
wherever you put this product,

00:03:41.485 --> 00:03:44.320
you're able to reassemble 
into it immediately.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.681
Now, this is a simulated arterial bleed —

00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:48.040
blood warning —

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.840
at twice human artery pressure.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.273
So now, this type of bleed 
is incredibly traumatic,

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:54.500
and like I said before, 
would actually take

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.356
five minutes or more with pressure

00:03:56.356 --> 00:03:57.728
to be able to stop.

00:03:57.728 --> 00:04:00.749
Now, in the time that it takes
me to introduce the bleed itself,

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.878
our material is able to stop that bleed,

00:04:02.878 --> 00:04:05.154
and it's because it actually 
goes on and works

00:04:05.154 --> 00:04:06.886
with the body to heal,

00:04:06.886 --> 00:04:09.258
so it reassembles into this piece of meat,

00:04:09.258 --> 00:04:12.138
and then the blood actually recognizes

00:04:12.138 --> 00:04:14.725
that that's happening, 
and produces fibrin,

00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:18.470
producing a very fast clot in less than 10 seconds.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.349
So now this technology — Thank you.

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:24.733
(Applause)

00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:32.188
So now this technology, by January,
will be in the hands of veterinarians,

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:35.765
and we're working very diligently to 
try to get it into the hands of doctors,

00:04:35.765 --> 00:04:37.530
hopefully within the next year.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.137
But really, once again, I 
want you guys to imagine

00:04:40.137 --> 00:04:42.160
that you are a soldier running 
through a battlefield.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.927
Now, you get hit in the leg with a bullet,

00:04:43.927 --> 00:04:47.260
and instead of bleeding 
out in three minutes,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.248
you pull a small pack 
of gel out of your belt,

00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:50.575
and with the press of a button,

00:04:50.575 --> 00:04:51.984
you're able to stop your own bleed

00:04:51.984 --> 00:04:53.893
and you're on your way to recovery.

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:55.783
Thank you very much.

00:04:55.783 --> 00:04:59.783
(Applause)
