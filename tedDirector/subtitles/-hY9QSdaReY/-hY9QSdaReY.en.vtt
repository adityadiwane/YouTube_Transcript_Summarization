00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:15.429
Once there was a star.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.804
Like everything else, she was born;

00:00:18.828 --> 00:00:22.609
grew to be around 30 times
the mass of our sun

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:24.926
and lived for a very long time.

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:26.843
Exactly how long,

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:28.606
people cannot really tell.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.941
Just like everything in life,

00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:34.414
she reached the end
of her regular star days

00:00:34.438 --> 00:00:37.015
when her heart, the core of her life,

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:38.505
exhausted its fuel.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:40.212
But that was no end.

00:00:40.236 --> 00:00:43.762
She transformed into a supernova,
and in the process

00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:46.440
releasing a tremendous amount of energy,

00:00:46.464 --> 00:00:49.172
outshining the rest of the galaxy

00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:51.530
and emitting, in one second,

00:00:51.554 --> 00:00:55.627
the same amount of energy
our sun will release in 10 days.

00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:58.922
And she evolved
into another role in our galaxy.

00:00:59.783 --> 00:01:02.257
Supernova explosions are very extreme.

00:01:02.638 --> 00:01:06.858
But the ones that emit gamma rays
are even more extreme.

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:09.706
In the process of becoming a supernova,

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.153
the interior of the star collapses
under its own weight

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:16.065
and it starts rotating ever faster,

00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:19.954
like an ice skater when pulling
their arms in close to their body.

00:01:20.592 --> 00:01:25.050
In that way, it starts rotating very fast
and it increases, powerfully,

00:01:25.074 --> 00:01:26.634
its magnetic field.

00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:30.100
The matter around the star
is dragged around,

00:01:30.124 --> 00:01:33.442
and some energy from that rotation
is transferred to that matter

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:36.874
and the magnetic field
is increased even further.

00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:43.239
In that way, our star had extra energy
to outshine the rest of the galaxy

00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:45.566
in brightness and gamma ray emission.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.608
My star, the one in my story,

00:01:48.632 --> 00:01:51.280
became what is known as a magnetar.

00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:52.985
And just for your information,

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.890
the magnetic field of a magnetar
is 1,000 trillion times

00:01:56.914 --> 00:01:58.683
the magnetic field of Earth.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.609
The most energetic events
ever measured by astronomers

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:04.888
carry the name gamma-ray bursts

00:02:04.912 --> 00:02:08.519
because we observe them
as bursts most or explosions,

00:02:08.543 --> 00:02:11.076
most strongly measured as gamma-ray light.

00:02:11.886 --> 00:02:16.091
Our star, like the one in our story
that became a magnetar,

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:18.186
is detected as a gamma-ray burst

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.770
during the most energetic
portion of the explosion.

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:27.468
Yet, even though gamma-ray bursts
are the strongest events

00:02:27.492 --> 00:02:29.581
ever measured by astronomers,

00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:32.242
we cannot see them with our naked eye.

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:34.594
We depend, we rely on other methods

00:02:34.618 --> 00:02:37.407
in order to study this gamma-ray light.

00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:39.278
We cannot see them with our naked eye.

00:02:39.302 --> 00:02:42.372
We can only see
an itty bitty, tiny portion

00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:46.122
of the electromagnetic spectrum
that we call visible light.

00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:48.418
And beyond that, we rely on other methods.

00:02:48.442 --> 00:02:53.702
Yet as astronomers,
we study a wider range of light

00:02:53.726 --> 00:02:56.490
and we depend on other methods to do that.

00:02:56.514 --> 00:02:59.090
On the screen, it may look like this.

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.544
You're seeing a plot.

00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:03.493
That is a light curve.

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:07.066
It's a plot of intensity
of light over time.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.554
It is a gamma-ray light curve.

00:03:10.013 --> 00:03:13.705
Sighted astronomers
depend on this kind of plot

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:18.401
in order to interpret how
this light intensity changes over time.

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:24.449
On the left, you will be seeing
the light intensity without a burst,

00:03:24.473 --> 00:03:28.628
and on the right, you will be seeing
the light intensity with the burst.

00:03:30.381 --> 00:03:34.082
Early during my career,
I could also see this kind of plot.

00:03:34.562 --> 00:03:37.290
But then, I lost my sight.

00:03:37.314 --> 00:03:40.466
I completely lost my sight
because of extended illness,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.175
and with it, I lost
the opportunity to see this plot

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:47.965
and the opportunity to do my physics.

00:03:49.672 --> 00:03:52.127
It was a very strong transition
for me in many ways.

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:57.540
And professionally, it left me
without a way to do my science.

00:03:57.564 --> 00:04:02.179
I longed to access and scrutinize
this energetic light

00:04:02.203 --> 00:04:04.889
and figure out the astrophysical cause.

00:04:04.913 --> 00:04:08.375
I wanted to experience
the spacious wonder, the excitement,

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:12.848
the joy produced by the detection
of such a titanic celestial event.

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:16.652
I thought long and hard about it,

00:04:16.676 --> 00:04:20.361
when I suddenly realized
that all a light curve is,

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:24.226
is a table of numbers
converted into a visual plot.

00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:26.762
So along with my collaborators,

00:04:26.786 --> 00:04:30.994
we worked really hard and we translated
the numbers into sound.

00:04:31.765 --> 00:04:33.769
I achieved access to the data,

00:04:33.793 --> 00:04:38.806
and today I'm able to do physics
at the level of the best astronomer,

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.981
using sound.

00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:42.633
And what people have been able to do,

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:43.810
mainly visually,

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:45.178
for hundreds of years,

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:47.544
now I do it using sound.

00:04:47.892 --> 00:04:48.929
(Applause)

00:04:48.953 --> 00:04:50.655
Listening to this gamma-ray burst

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:52.999
that you're seeing on the --
(Applause continues)

00:04:53.023 --> 00:04:54.174
Thank you.

00:04:54.198 --> 00:04:56.906
Listening to this burst
that you're seeing on the screen

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.525
brought something to the ear
beyond the obvious burst.

00:04:59.973 --> 00:05:01.908
Now I'm going to play the burst for you.

00:05:01.932 --> 00:05:03.986
It's not music, it's sound.

00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:08.515
(Digital beeping sounds)

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.830
This is scientific data
converted into sound,

00:05:11.854 --> 00:05:13.088
and it's mapped in pitch.

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.531
The process is called sonification.

00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.268
So listening to this
brought something to the ear

00:05:21.292 --> 00:05:22.641
besides the obvious burst.

00:05:22.665 --> 00:05:27.186
When I examine the very strong
low-frequency regions,

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.082
or bass line -- I'm zooming
into the bass line now.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.019
We noted resonances characteristic
of electrically charged gasses

00:05:39.043 --> 00:05:40.645
like the solar wind.

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.172
And I want you to hear what I heard.

00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:46.977
You will hear it as a very fast
decrease in volume.

00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:49.764
And because you're sighted,
I'm giving you a red line

00:05:49.788 --> 00:05:53.727
indicating what intensity of light
is being converted into sound.

00:05:55.672 --> 00:05:58.086
(Digital hum and whistling sound)

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.404
The (Whistles) is frogs at home,
don't pay attention to that.

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:03.274
(Laughter)

00:06:03.298 --> 00:06:08.525
(Digital hum and whistling sound)

00:06:08.549 --> 00:06:10.421
I think you heard it, right?

00:06:11.503 --> 00:06:12.780
So what we found

00:06:12.804 --> 00:06:17.718
is that the bursts last long enough
in order to support wave resonances,

00:06:17.742 --> 00:06:21.959
which are things caused by exchanges
of energy between particles

00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:23.301
that may have been excited,

00:06:23.325 --> 00:06:24.706
that depend on the volume.

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:28.241
You may remember that I said
that the matter around the star

00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:29.921
is dragged around?

00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:33.759
It transmits power with frequency
and field distribution

00:06:33.783 --> 00:06:35.505
determined by the dimensions.

00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:40.384
You may remember that we were talking
about a super-massive star

00:06:40.408 --> 00:06:43.576
that became a very strong
magnetic field magnetar.

00:06:44.264 --> 00:06:48.637
If this is the case, then outflows
from the exploding star

00:06:48.661 --> 00:06:51.144
may be associated
with this gamma-ray burst.

00:06:51.168 --> 00:06:52.736
What does that mean?

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.727
That star formation
may be a very important part

00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:57.265
of these supernova explosions.

00:06:58.047 --> 00:07:02.434
Listening to this very gamma-ray burst
brought us to the notion

00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:05.257
that the use of sound
as an adjunctive visual display

00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:07.506
may also support sighted astronomers

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.980
in the search for more
information in the data.

00:07:10.562 --> 00:07:15.880
Simultaneously, I worked on analyzing
measurements from other telescopes,

00:07:15.904 --> 00:07:18.107
and my experiments demonstrated

00:07:18.131 --> 00:07:22.345
that when you use sound
as an adjunctive visual display,

00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:25.285
astronomers can find more information

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:28.176
in this now more accessible data set.

00:07:29.086 --> 00:07:32.830
This ability to transform data into sound

00:07:32.854 --> 00:07:35.931
gives astronomy a tremendous
power of transformation.

00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:40.322
And the fact that a field
that is so visual may be improved

00:07:40.346 --> 00:07:45.019
in order to include anyone with interest
in understanding what lies in the heavens

00:07:45.043 --> 00:07:46.552
is a spirit-lifter.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.279
When I lost my sight,

00:07:49.303 --> 00:07:51.379
I noticed that I didn't have access

00:07:51.403 --> 00:07:54.029
to the same amount
and quality of information

00:07:54.053 --> 00:07:55.449
a sighted astronomer had.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.700
It was not until we innovated
with the sonification process

00:07:59.724 --> 00:08:03.676
that I regained the hope
to be a productive member of the field

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.310
that I had worked so hard to be part of.

00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:11.880
Yet, information access
is not the only area in astronomy

00:08:11.904 --> 00:08:14.088
where this is important.

00:08:14.602 --> 00:08:17.126
The situation is systemic

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.119
and scientific fields are not keeping up.

00:08:20.825 --> 00:08:23.477
The body is something changeable --

00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:26.866
anyone may develop
a disability at any point.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.128
Let's think about, for example,

00:08:29.152 --> 00:08:31.939
scientists that are already
at the top of their careers.

00:08:31.963 --> 00:08:34.803
What happens to them
if they develop a disability?

00:08:34.827 --> 00:08:37.244
Will they feel excommunicated as I did?

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:41.029
Information access
empowers us to flourish.

00:08:41.499 --> 00:08:45.099
It gives us equal opportunities
to display our talents

00:08:45.123 --> 00:08:47.986
and choose what we want
to do with our lives,

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.318
based on interest and not based
on potential barriers.

00:08:52.294 --> 00:08:56.661
When we give people the opportunity
to succeed without limits,

00:08:56.685 --> 00:09:01.243
that will lead to personal fulfillment
and prospering life.

00:09:01.267 --> 00:09:03.700
And I think that the use
of sound in astronomy

00:09:03.724 --> 00:09:07.201
is helping us to achieve that
and to contribute to science.

00:09:08.119 --> 00:09:12.651
While other countries told me
that the study of perception techniques

00:09:12.675 --> 00:09:16.252
in order to study astronomy data
is not relevant to astronomy

00:09:16.276 --> 00:09:19.476
because there are no blind
astronomers in the field,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.904
South Africa said, "We want
people with disabilities

00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:24.904
to contribute to the field."

00:09:24.928 --> 00:09:26.254
Right now, I'm working

00:09:26.278 --> 00:09:29.010
at the South African
Astronomical Observatory,

00:09:29.034 --> 00:09:32.119
at the Office of Astronomy
for Development.

00:09:32.436 --> 00:09:37.177
There, we are working on sonification
techniques and analysis methods

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:40.647
to impact the students
of the Athlone School for the Blind.

00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:44.089
These students will be learning
radio astronomy,

00:09:44.113 --> 00:09:47.351
and they will be learning
the sonification methods

00:09:47.375 --> 00:09:51.846
in order to study astronomical events
like huge ejections of energy

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.306
from the sun, known as
coronal mass ejections.

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:56.953
What we learn with these students --

00:09:56.977 --> 00:10:00.774
these students have multiple disabilities
and coping strategies

00:10:00.798 --> 00:10:02.674
that will be accommodated --

00:10:02.698 --> 00:10:05.537
what we learn with these students
will directly impact

00:10:05.561 --> 00:10:08.718
the way things are being done
at the professional level.

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:10.801
I humbly call this development.

00:10:10.825 --> 00:10:13.081
And this is happening right now.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.728
I think that science is for everyone.

00:10:18.275 --> 00:10:19.723
It belongs to the people,

00:10:19.747 --> 00:10:21.998
and it has to be available to everyone,

00:10:22.022 --> 00:10:24.235
because we are all natural explorers.

00:10:24.956 --> 00:10:30.136
I think that if we limit people
with disabilities

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.000
from participating in science,

00:10:32.024 --> 00:10:35.672
we'll sever our links with history
and with society.

00:10:35.696 --> 00:10:39.142
I dream of a level
scientific playing field,

00:10:39.166 --> 00:10:44.154
where people encourage respect
and respect each other,

00:10:44.178 --> 00:10:47.266
where people exchange strategies
and discover together.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:52.107
If people with disabilities
are allowed into the scientific field,

00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:56.840
an explosion, a huge titanic burst
of knowledge will take place,

00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:58.341
I am sure.

00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:03.100
(Digital beeping sounds)

00:11:03.124 --> 00:11:04.988
That is the titanic burst.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.571
Thank you.

00:11:07.595 --> 00:11:08.746
Thank you.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:14.442
(Applause)
