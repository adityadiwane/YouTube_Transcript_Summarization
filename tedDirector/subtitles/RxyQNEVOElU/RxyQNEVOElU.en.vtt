00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.058
Every day we face issues like climate change

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:17.488
or the safety of vaccines

00:00:17.488 --> 00:00:20.528
where we have to answer questions whose answers

00:00:20.528 --> 00:00:23.989
rely heavily on scientific information.

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.870
Scientists tell us that the world is warming.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.411
Scientists tell us that vaccines are safe.

00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:31.465
But how do we know if they are right?

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:33.429
Why should be believe the science?

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:36.898
The fact is, many of us actually
don't believe the science.

00:00:36.898 --> 00:00:39.074
Public opinion polls consistently show

00:00:39.074 --> 00:00:42.084
that significant proportions of the American people

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:45.625
don't believe the climate is
warming due to human activities,

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:48.564
don't think that there is
evolution by natural selection,

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:52.465
and aren't persuaded by the safety of vaccines.

00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:56.096
So why should we believe the science?

00:00:56.096 --> 00:00:59.707
Well, scientists don't like talking about 
science as a matter of belief.

00:00:59.707 --> 00:01:02.294
In fact, they would contrast science with faith,

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:05.260
and they would say belief is the domain of faith.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.038
And faith is a separate thing
apart and distinct from science.

00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:12.190
Indeed they would say religion is based on faith

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.884
or maybe the calculus of Pascal's wager.

00:01:15.884 --> 00:01:18.560
Blaise Pascal was a 17th-century mathematician

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.370
who tried to bring scientific
reasoning to the question of

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.242
whether or not he should believe in God,

00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:25.846
and his wager went like this:

00:01:25.846 --> 00:01:28.395
Well, if God doesn't exist

00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:30.420
but I decide to believe in him

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.398
nothing much is really lost.

00:01:32.398 --> 00:01:34.011
Maybe a few hours on Sunday.

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:35.004
(Laughter)

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:38.385
But if he does exist and I don't believe in him,

00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:40.402
then I'm in deep trouble.

00:01:40.402 --> 00:01:43.438
And so Pascal said, we'd better believe in God.

00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:45.610
Or as one of my college professors said,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.836
"He clutched for the handrail of faith."

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:49.772
He made that leap of faith

00:01:49.772 --> 00:01:54.296
leaving science and rationalism behind.

00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:56.992
Now the fact is though, for most of us,

00:01:56.992 --> 00:02:00.126
most scientific claims are a leap of faith.

00:02:00.126 --> 00:02:04.511
We can't really judge scientific
claims for ourselves in most cases.

00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:07.351
And indeed this is actually
true for most scientists as well

00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:09.681
outside of their own specialties.

00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:12.201
So if you think about it, a geologist can't tell you

00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:13.951
whether a vaccine is safe.

00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:16.951
Most chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory.

00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:19.210
A physicist cannot tell you,

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.653
despite the claims of some of them,

00:02:20.653 --> 00:02:24.007
whether or not tobacco causes cancer.

00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.457
So, if even scientists themselves

00:02:26.457 --> 00:02:27.733
have to make a leap of faith

00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:29.655
outside their own fields,

00:02:29.655 --> 00:02:33.583
then why do they accept the
claims of other scientists?

00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:35.881
Why do they believe each other's claims?

00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:39.171
And should we believe those claims?

00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:41.947
So what I'd like to argue is yes, we should,

00:02:41.947 --> 00:02:44.830
but not for the reason that most of us think.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.160
Most of us were taught in school
that the reason we should

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.572
believe in science is because of the scientific method.

00:02:50.572 --> 00:02:53.488
We were taught that scientists follow a method

00:02:53.488 --> 00:02:55.844
and that this method guarantees

00:02:55.844 --> 00:02:57.840
the truth of their claims.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.260
The method that most of us were taught in school,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.836
we can call it the textbook method,

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:05.620
is the hypothetical deductive method.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.714
According to the standard
model, the textbook model,

00:03:08.714 --> 00:03:11.671
scientists develop hypotheses, they deduce

00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:14.131
the consequences of those hypotheses,

00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:15.841
and then they go out into the world and they say,

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:18.215
"Okay, well are those consequences true?"

00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:21.548
Can we observe them taking
place in the natural world?

00:03:21.548 --> 00:03:24.148
And if they are true, then the scientists say,

00:03:24.148 --> 00:03:27.004
"Great, we know the hypothesis is correct."

00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:29.183
So there are many famous examples in the history

00:03:29.183 --> 00:03:32.062
of science of scientists doing exactly this.

00:03:32.062 --> 00:03:34.120
One of the most famous examples

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.333
comes from the work of Albert Einstein.

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.855
When Einstein developed the
theory of general relativity,

00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:41.171
one of the consequences of his theory

00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.010
was that space-time wasn't just an empty void

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.919
but that it actually had a fabric.

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.520
And that that fabric was bent

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.900
in the presence of massive objects like the sun.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.649
So if this theory were true then it meant that light

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:55.177
as it passed the sun

00:03:55.177 --> 00:03:57.345
should actually be bent around it.

00:03:57.345 --> 00:03:59.745
That was a pretty startling prediction

00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:01.733
and it took a few years before scientists

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:03.011
were able to test it

00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:05.521
but they did test it in 1919,

00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:07.971
and lo and behold it turned out to be true.

00:04:07.971 --> 00:04:11.129
Starlight actually does bend
as it travels around the sun.

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.623
This was a huge confirmation of the theory.

00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:15.428
It was considered proof of the truth

00:04:15.428 --> 00:04:16.740
of this radical new idea,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.592
and it was written up in many newspapers

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:21.130
around the globe.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.480
Now, sometimes this theory or this model

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.914
is referred to as the deductive-nomological model,

00:04:26.914 --> 00:04:30.298
mainly because academics like 
to make things complicated.

00:04:30.298 --> 00:04:35.559
But also because in the ideal case, it's about laws.

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:38.061
So nomological means having to do with laws.

00:04:38.061 --> 00:04:41.485
And in the ideal case, the hypothesis isn't just an idea:

00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:43.811
ideally, it is a law of nature.

00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:46.098
Why does it matter that it is a law of nature?

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:48.826
Because if it is a law, it can't be broken.

00:04:48.826 --> 00:04:50.934
If it's a law then it will always be true

00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:52.178
in all times and all places

00:04:52.178 --> 00:04:54.384
no matter what the circumstances are.

00:04:54.384 --> 00:04:57.613
And all of you know of at least
one example of a famous law:

00:04:57.613 --> 00:05:01.368
Einstein's famous equation, E=MC2,

00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:03.168
which tells us what the relationship is

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:05.361
between energy and mass.

00:05:05.361 --> 00:05:09.361
And that relationship is true no matter what.

00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:13.010
Now, it turns out, though, that there 
are several problems with this model.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.645
The main problem is that it's wrong.

00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:20.147
It's just not true. (Laughter)

00:05:20.147 --> 00:05:22.870
And I'm going to talk about
three reasons why it's wrong.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.549
So the first reason is a logical reason.

00:05:25.549 --> 00:05:29.065
It's the problem of the fallacy
of affirming the consequent.

00:05:29.065 --> 00:05:31.891
So that's another fancy, academic way of saying

00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:34.561
that false theories can make true predictions.

00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:36.555
So just because the prediction comes true

00:05:36.555 --> 00:05:39.777
doesn't actually logically
prove that the theory is correct.

00:05:39.777 --> 00:05:43.708
And I have a good example of that too, 
again from the history of science.

00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:46.403
This is a picture of the Ptolemaic universe

00:05:46.403 --> 00:05:48.265
with the Earth at the center of the universe

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:50.860
and the sun and the planets going around it.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.890
The Ptolemaic model was believed

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.143
by many very smart people for many centuries.

00:05:56.143 --> 00:05:57.879
Well, why?

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.316
Well the answer is because it made 
lots of predictions that came true.

00:06:01.316 --> 00:06:03.332
The Ptolemaic system enabled astronomers

00:06:03.332 --> 00:06:06.082
to make accurate predictions
of the motions of the planet,

00:06:06.082 --> 00:06:08.601
in fact more accurate predictions at first

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:12.925
than the Copernican theory
which we now would say is true.

00:06:12.925 --> 00:06:15.907
So that's one problem with the textbook model.

00:06:15.907 --> 00:06:18.303
A second problem is a practical problem,

00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:21.538
and it's the problem of auxiliary hypotheses.

00:06:21.538 --> 00:06:24.367
Auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:26.146
that scientists are making

00:06:26.146 --> 00:06:29.189
that they may or may not even
be aware that they're making.

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:31.850
So an important example of this

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.945
comes from the Copernican model,

00:06:33.945 --> 00:06:37.137
which ultimately replaced the Ptolemaic system.

00:06:37.137 --> 00:06:39.177
So when Nicolaus Copernicus said,

00:06:39.177 --> 00:06:41.827
actually the Earth is not the center of the universe,

00:06:41.827 --> 00:06:43.745
the sun is the center of the solar system,

00:06:43.745 --> 00:06:45.127
the Earth moves around the sun.

00:06:45.127 --> 00:06:48.855
Scientists said, well okay, Nicolaus, if that's true

00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:50.619
we ought to be able to detect the motion

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.577
of the Earth around the sun.

00:06:52.577 --> 00:06:54.633
And so this slide here illustrates a concept

00:06:54.633 --> 00:06:56.441
known as stellar parallax.

00:06:56.441 --> 00:07:00.263
And astronomers said, if the Earth is moving

00:07:00.263 --> 00:07:03.463
and we look at a prominent star, let's say, Sirius --

00:07:03.463 --> 00:07:05.877
well I know I'm in Manhattan
so you guys can't see the stars,

00:07:05.877 --> 00:07:09.608
but imagine you're out in the country, 
imagine you chose that rural life —

00:07:09.608 --> 00:07:12.475
and we look at a star in December, we see that star

00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:15.240
against the backdrop of distant stars.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.194
If we now make the same observation six months later

00:07:18.194 --> 00:07:22.006
when the Earth has moved to this position in June,

00:07:22.006 --> 00:07:26.105
we look at that same star and we 
see it against a different backdrop.

00:07:26.105 --> 00:07:30.287
That difference, that angular
difference, is the stellar parallax.

00:07:30.287 --> 00:07:33.150
So this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.711
Astronomers looked for the stellar parallax

00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:40.693
and they found nothing, nothing at all.

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:44.559
And many people argued that this proved 
that the Copernican model was false.

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:46.047
So what happened?

00:07:46.047 --> 00:07:48.730
Well, in hindsight we can say 
that astronomers were making

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.277
two auxiliary hypotheses, both of which

00:07:51.277 --> 00:07:53.940
we would now say were incorrect.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.575
The first was an assumption 
about the size of the Earth's orbit.

00:07:57.575 --> 00:08:00.611
Astronomers were assuming 
that the Earth's orbit was large

00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:02.949
relative to the distance to the stars.

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:05.413
Today we would draw the picture more like this,

00:08:05.413 --> 00:08:06.760
this comes from NASA,

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.183
and you see the Earth's orbit is actually quite small.

00:08:09.183 --> 00:08:12.174
In fact, it's actually much
smaller even than shown here.

00:08:12.174 --> 00:08:13.713
The stellar parallax therefore,

00:08:13.713 --> 00:08:17.297
is very small and actually very hard to detect.

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:19.271
And that leads to the second reason

00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:21.130
why the prediction didn't work,

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.045
because scientists were also assuming

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:26.055
that the telescopes they had were sensitive enough

00:08:26.055 --> 00:08:27.955
to detect the parallax.

00:08:27.955 --> 00:08:29.972
And that turned out not to be true.

00:08:29.972 --> 00:08:32.506
It wasn't until the 19th century

00:08:32.506 --> 00:08:34.190
that scientists were able to detect

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.726
the stellar parallax.

00:08:35.726 --> 00:08:38.372
So, there's a third problem as well.

00:08:38.372 --> 00:08:41.150
The third problem is simply a factual problem,

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.966
that a lot of science doesn't fit the textbook model.

00:08:43.966 --> 00:08:46.239
A lot of science isn't deductive at all,

00:08:46.239 --> 00:08:48.007
it's actually inductive.

00:08:48.007 --> 00:08:50.523
And by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily

00:08:50.523 --> 00:08:52.754
start with theories and hypotheses,

00:08:52.754 --> 00:08:54.623
often they just start with observations

00:08:54.623 --> 00:08:57.032
of stuff going on in the world.

00:08:57.032 --> 00:08:59.602
And the most famous example
of that is one of the most

00:08:59.602 --> 00:09:02.667
famous scientists who ever lived, Charles Darwin.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.829
When Darwin went out as a young 
man on the voyage of the Beagle,

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:09.441
he didn't have a hypothesis, he didn't have a theory.

00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:12.507
He just knew that he wanted
to have a career as a scientist

00:09:12.507 --> 00:09:14.519
and he started to collect data.

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:17.249
Mainly he knew that he hated medicine

00:09:17.249 --> 00:09:19.067
because the sight of blood made him sick so

00:09:19.067 --> 00:09:21.335
he had to have an alternative career path.

00:09:21.335 --> 00:09:23.469
So he started collecting data.

00:09:23.469 --> 00:09:26.635
And he collected many things, 
including his famous finches.

00:09:26.635 --> 00:09:28.845
When he collected these finches,
he threw them in a bag

00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:31.185
and he had no idea what they meant.

00:09:31.185 --> 00:09:33.472
Many years later back in London,

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:35.705
Darwin looked at his data again and began

00:09:35.705 --> 00:09:38.153
to develop an explanation,

00:09:38.153 --> 00:09:41.451
and that explanation was the
theory of natural selection.

00:09:41.451 --> 00:09:43.510
Besides inductive science,

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.446
scientists also often participate in modeling.

00:09:46.446 --> 00:09:48.782
One of the things scientists want to do in life

00:09:48.782 --> 00:09:51.050
is to explain the causes of things.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.568
And how do we do that?

00:09:52.568 --> 00:09:54.820
Well, one way you can do it is to build a model

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.562
that tests an idea.

00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:58.493
So this is a picture of Henry Cadell,

00:09:58.493 --> 00:10:01.359
who was a Scottish geologist in the 19th century.

00:10:01.359 --> 00:10:02.792
You can tell he's Scottish because he's wearing

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:05.180
a deerstalker cap and Wellington boots.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.334
(Laughter)

00:10:07.334 --> 00:10:08.900
And Cadell wanted to answer the question,

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.668
how are mountains formed?

00:10:10.668 --> 00:10:12.184
And one of the things he had observed

00:10:12.184 --> 00:10:14.758
is that if you look at mountains
like the Appalachians,

00:10:14.758 --> 00:10:16.391
you often find that the rocks in them

00:10:16.391 --> 00:10:17.860
are folded,

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.506
and they're folded in a particular way,

00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:20.950
which suggested to him

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.899
that they were actually being
compressed from the side.

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:25.987
And this idea would later play a major role

00:10:25.987 --> 00:10:28.410
in discussions of continental drift.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.916
So he built this model, this crazy contraption

00:10:30.916 --> 00:10:33.068
with levers and wood, and here's his wheelbarrow,

00:10:33.068 --> 00:10:35.510
buckets, a big sledgehammer.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.408
I don't know why he's got the Wellington boots.

00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:38.985
Maybe it's going to rain.

00:10:38.985 --> 00:10:42.070
And he created this physical model in order

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.035
to demonstrate that you could, in fact, create

00:10:46.035 --> 00:10:48.709
patterns in rocks, or at least, in this case, in mud,

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:50.935
that looked a lot like mountains

00:10:50.935 --> 00:10:52.777
if you compressed them from the side.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:56.405
So it was an argument about
the cause of mountains.

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:59.453
Nowadays, most scientists prefer to work inside,

00:10:59.453 --> 00:11:01.880
so they don't build physical models so much

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.241
as to make computer simulations.

00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:07.080
But a computer simulation is a kind of a model.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.943
It's a model that's made with mathematics,

00:11:08.943 --> 00:11:12.176
and like the physical models of the 19th century,

00:11:12.176 --> 00:11:15.954
it's very important for thinking about causes.

00:11:15.954 --> 00:11:18.569
So one of the big questions
to do with climate change,

00:11:18.569 --> 00:11:20.372
we have tremendous amounts of evidence

00:11:20.372 --> 00:11:22.252
that the Earth is warming up.

00:11:22.252 --> 00:11:24.716
This slide here, the black line shows

00:11:24.716 --> 00:11:26.836
the measurements that scientists have taken

00:11:26.836 --> 00:11:28.799
for the last 150 years

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:30.209
showing that the Earth's temperature

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:31.843
has steadily increased,

00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:34.689
and you can see in particular
that in the last 50 years

00:11:34.689 --> 00:11:36.453
there's been this dramatic increase

00:11:36.453 --> 00:11:38.793
of nearly one degree centigrade,

00:11:38.793 --> 00:11:41.168
or almost two degrees Fahrenheit.

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:43.605
So what, though, is driving that change?

00:11:43.605 --> 00:11:45.940
How can we know what's causing

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.456
the observed warming?

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:49.170
Well, scientists can model it

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.538
using a computer simulation.

00:11:51.538 --> 00:11:54.330
So this diagram illustrates a computer simulation

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.451
that has looked at all the different factors

00:11:56.451 --> 00:11:59.056
that we know can influence the Earth's climate,

00:11:59.056 --> 00:12:01.808
so sulfate particles from air pollution,

00:12:01.808 --> 00:12:04.778
volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions,

00:12:04.778 --> 00:12:07.012
changes in solar radiation,

00:12:07.012 --> 00:12:09.390
and, of course, greenhouse gases.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.208
And they asked the question,

00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:14.904
what set of variables put into a model

00:12:14.904 --> 00:12:17.880
will reproduce what we actually see in real life?

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.900
So here is the real life in black.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.180
Here's the model in this light gray,

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.740
and the answer is

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.127
a model that includes, it's the answer E on that SAT,

00:12:28.127 --> 00:12:30.268
all of the above.

00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:31.774
The only way you can reproduce

00:12:31.774 --> 00:12:33.602
the observed temperature measurements

00:12:33.602 --> 00:12:35.580
is with all of these things put together,

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.719
including greenhouse gases,

00:12:37.719 --> 00:12:40.270
and in particular you can see that the increase

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.154
in greenhouse gases tracks

00:12:42.154 --> 00:12:44.360
this very dramatic increase in temperature

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.840
over the last 50 years.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.274
And so this is why climate scientists say

00:12:48.274 --> 00:12:51.382
it's not just that we know that
climate change is happening,

00:12:51.382 --> 00:12:54.150
we know that greenhouse gases are a major part

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.880
of the reason why.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.268
So now because there all these different things

00:12:59.268 --> 00:13:00.757
that scientists do,

00:13:00.757 --> 00:13:04.243
the philosopher Paul Feyerabend famously said,

00:13:04.243 --> 00:13:05.869
"The only principle in science

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:09.848
that doesn't inhibit progress is: anything goes."

00:13:09.848 --> 00:13:12.464
Now this quotation has often
been taken out of context,

00:13:12.464 --> 00:13:14.582
because Feyerabend was not actually saying

00:13:14.582 --> 00:13:16.532
that in science anything goes.

00:13:16.532 --> 00:13:17.876
What he was saying was,

00:13:17.876 --> 00:13:19.900
actually the full quotation is,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.990
"If you press me to say

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.636
what is the method of science,

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:27.265
I would have to say: anything goes."

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:28.343
What he was trying to say

00:13:28.343 --> 00:13:30.910
is that scientists do a lot of different things.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.218
Scientists are creative.

00:13:33.218 --> 00:13:35.328
But then this pushes the question back:

00:13:35.328 --> 00:13:38.799
If scientists don't use a single method,

00:13:38.799 --> 00:13:40.698
then how do they decide

00:13:40.698 --> 00:13:42.156
what's right and what's wrong?

00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:44.050
And who judges?

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.130
And the answer is, scientists judge,

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.013
and they judge by judging evidence.

00:13:49.013 --> 00:13:52.422
Scientists collect evidence in many different ways,

00:13:52.422 --> 00:13:54.044
but however they collect it,

00:13:54.044 --> 00:13:56.621
they have to subject it to scrutiny.

00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:59.181
And this led the sociologist Robert Merton

00:13:59.181 --> 00:14:01.361
to focus on this question of how scientists

00:14:01.361 --> 00:14:03.040
scrutinize data and evidence,

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.848
and he said they do it in a way he called

00:14:05.848 --> 00:14:07.767
"organized skepticism."

00:14:07.767 --> 00:14:09.651
And by that he meant it's organized

00:14:09.651 --> 00:14:11.129
because they do it collectively,

00:14:11.129 --> 00:14:12.758
they do it as a group,

00:14:12.758 --> 00:14:15.574
and skepticism, because they do it from a position

00:14:15.574 --> 00:14:17.028
of distrust.

00:14:17.028 --> 00:14:18.990
That is to say, the burden of proof

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.471
is on the person with a novel claim.

00:14:21.471 --> 00:14:24.614
And in this sense, science
is intrinsically conservative.

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:27.186
It's quite hard to persuade the scientific community

00:14:27.186 --> 00:14:30.897
to say, "Yes, we know something, this is true."

00:14:30.897 --> 00:14:33.393
So despite the popularity of the concept

00:14:33.393 --> 00:14:34.990
of paradigm shifts,

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.274
what we find is that actually,

00:14:36.274 --> 00:14:39.059
really major changes in scientific thinking

00:14:39.059 --> 00:14:42.779
are relatively rare in the history of science.

00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:46.342
So finally that brings us to one more idea:

00:14:46.342 --> 00:14:50.050
If scientists judge evidence collectively,

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.612
this has led historians to focus on the question

00:14:52.612 --> 00:14:54.031
of consensus,

00:14:54.031 --> 00:14:55.926
and to say that at the end of the day,

00:14:55.926 --> 00:14:57.860
what science is,

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.530
what scientific knowledge is,

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.909
is the consensus of the scientific experts

00:15:02.909 --> 00:15:05.063
who through this process of organized scrutiny,

00:15:05.063 --> 00:15:07.368
collective scrutiny,

00:15:07.368 --> 00:15:08.610
have judged the evidence

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.407
and come to a conclusion about it,

00:15:11.407 --> 00:15:13.884
either yea or nay.

00:15:13.884 --> 00:15:15.608
So we can think of scientific knowledge

00:15:15.608 --> 00:15:17.660
as a consensus of experts.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.432
We can also think of science as being

00:15:19.432 --> 00:15:21.010
a kind of a jury,

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.524
except it's a very special kind of jury.

00:15:23.524 --> 00:15:25.628
It's not a jury of your peers,

00:15:25.628 --> 00:15:27.524
it's a jury of geeks.

00:15:27.524 --> 00:15:31.158
It's a jury of men and women with Ph.D.s,

00:15:31.158 --> 00:15:33.600
and unlike a conventional jury,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.290
which has only two choices,

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.975
guilty or not guilty,

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:41.376
the scientific jury actually has a number of choices.

00:15:41.376 --> 00:15:44.160
Scientists can say yes, something's true.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.740
Scientists can say no, it's false.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.280
Or, they can say, well it might be true

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.324
but we need to work more
and collect more evidence.

00:15:52.324 --> 00:15:53.940
Or, they can say it might be true,

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.640
but we don't know how to answer the question

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.950
and we're going to put it aside

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.873
and maybe we'll come back to it later.

00:15:59.873 --> 00:16:03.875
That's what scientists call "intractable."

00:16:03.875 --> 00:16:06.481
But this leads us to one final problem:

00:16:06.481 --> 00:16:09.419
If science is what scientists say it is,

00:16:09.419 --> 00:16:11.960
then isn't that just an appeal to authority?

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.022
And weren't we all taught in school

00:16:13.022 --> 00:16:16.249
that the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy?

00:16:16.249 --> 00:16:19.281
Well, here's the paradox of modern science,

00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:21.553
the paradox of the conclusion I think historians

00:16:21.553 --> 00:16:24.154
and philosophers and sociologists have come to,

00:16:24.154 --> 00:16:27.655
that actually science is the appeal to authority,

00:16:27.655 --> 00:16:31.431
but it's not the authority of the individual,

00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:33.830
no matter how smart that individual is,

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.695
like Plato or Socrates or Einstein.

00:16:37.695 --> 00:16:40.809
It's the authority of the collective community.

00:16:40.809 --> 00:16:43.795
You can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd,

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:47.921
but a very special kind of crowd.

00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:49.811
Science does appeal to authority,

00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:51.861
but it's not based on any individual,

00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:54.447
no matter how smart that individual may be.

00:16:54.447 --> 00:16:56.198
It's based on the collective wisdom,

00:16:56.198 --> 00:16:58.840
the collective knowledge, the collective work,

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.738
of all of the scientists who have worked

00:17:00.738 --> 00:17:03.455
on a particular problem.

00:17:03.455 --> 00:17:06.251
Scientists have a kind of culture of collective distrust,

00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:08.451
this "show me" culture,

00:17:08.451 --> 00:17:10.401
illustrated by this nice woman here

00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:13.483
showing her colleagues her evidence.

00:17:13.483 --> 00:17:15.340
Of course, these people don't
really look like scientists,

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.326
because they're much too happy.

00:17:17.326 --> 00:17:21.338
(Laughter)

00:17:21.338 --> 00:17:25.660
Okay, so that brings me to my final point.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.308
Most of us get up in the morning.

00:17:28.308 --> 00:17:29.718
Most of us trust our cars.

00:17:29.718 --> 00:17:31.260
Well, see, now I'm thinking, I'm in Manhattan,

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.558
this is a bad analogy,

00:17:32.558 --> 00:17:35.382
but most Americans who don't live in Manhattan

00:17:35.382 --> 00:17:37.120
get up in the morning and get in their cars

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.649
and turn on that ignition, and their cars work,

00:17:39.649 --> 00:17:41.650
and they work incredibly well.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.365
The modern automobile hardly ever breaks down.

00:17:44.365 --> 00:17:47.148
So why is that? Why do cars work so well?

00:17:47.148 --> 00:17:49.652
It's not because of the genius of Henry Ford

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:52.743
or Karl Benz or even Elon Musk.

00:17:52.743 --> 00:17:54.885
It's because the modern automobile

00:17:54.885 --> 00:17:59.919
is the product of more than 100 years of work

00:17:59.919 --> 00:18:01.509
by hundreds and thousands

00:18:01.509 --> 00:18:02.845
and tens of thousands of people.

00:18:02.845 --> 00:18:04.956
The modern automobile is the product

00:18:04.956 --> 00:18:07.745
of the collected work and wisdom and experience

00:18:07.745 --> 00:18:10.092
of every man and woman who has ever worked

00:18:10.092 --> 00:18:11.700
on a car,

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.615
and the reliability of the technology is the result

00:18:14.615 --> 00:18:17.298
of that accumulated effort.

00:18:17.298 --> 00:18:20.155
We benefit not just from the genius of Benz

00:18:20.155 --> 00:18:21.221
and Ford and Musk

00:18:21.221 --> 00:18:23.989
but from the collective intelligence and hard work

00:18:23.989 --> 00:18:26.240
of all of the people who have worked

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.910
on the modern car.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.960
And the same is true of science,

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.804
only science is even older.

00:18:32.804 --> 00:18:35.378
Our basis for trust in science is actually the same

00:18:35.378 --> 00:18:38.052
as our basis in trust in technology,

00:18:38.052 --> 00:18:42.039
and the same as our basis for trust in anything,

00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:44.317
namely, experience.

00:18:44.317 --> 00:18:46.161
But it shouldn't be blind trust

00:18:46.161 --> 00:18:48.921
any more than we would have blind trust in anything.

00:18:48.921 --> 00:18:51.762
Our trust in science, like science itself,

00:18:51.762 --> 00:18:53.675
should be based on evidence,

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.177
and that means that scientists

00:18:55.177 --> 00:18:57.225
have to become better communicators.

00:18:57.225 --> 00:19:00.112
They have to explain to us not just what they know

00:19:00.112 --> 00:19:01.840
but how they know it,

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.730
and it means that we have
to become better listeners.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.149
Thank you very much.

00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:09.452
(Applause)
