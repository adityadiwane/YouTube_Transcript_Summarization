00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
The recent debate over copyright laws

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
like SOPA in the United States

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and the ACTA agreement in Europe

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
has been very emotional.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
could really bring a great deal to the debate.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
I'd therefore like to propose

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
that we employ, we enlist,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
the cutting edge field of copyright math

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
whenever we approach this subject.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
For instance, just recently

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
the Motion Picture Association revealed

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
to copyright theft.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Now rather than just argue about this number,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
a copyright mathematician will analyze it

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and he'll soon discover that this money

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
could stretch from this auditorium

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
all the way across Ocean Boulevard

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
to the Westin, and then to Mars ...

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
(Laughter)

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
... if we use pennies.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Now this is obviously a powerful,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
some might say dangerously powerful, insight.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
But it's also a morally important one.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
of some pirated movies that we're talking about,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
but this is actual economic losses.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
This is the equivalent

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
to the entire American corn crop failing

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
along with all of our fruit crops,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
as well as wheat, tobacco,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
rice, sorghum --

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.260
whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
But identifying the actual losses to the economy

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
is almost impossible to do

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
unless we use copyright math.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
since Napster first came on the scene.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
So that's a chunk of what we're looking for.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
But total movie revenues

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
across theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Other content markets like book publishing and radio

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
are also up.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
So this small missing chunk here

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
is puzzling.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
(Laughter)

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
(Applause)

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Since the big content markets

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
have grown in line with historic norms,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
but copyright math tells us

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
it must therefore be foregone growth

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
in a market that has no historic norms --

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
one that didn't exist in the 90's.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
What we're looking at here

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.260
(Laughter)

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
50 billion dollars of it a year,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
that could stretch from here

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
to Neanderthal times.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.260
(Laughter)

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
It's true.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
(Applause)

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
I have Excel.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
(Laughter)

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
The movie folks also tell us

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
that our economy loses

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
over 370,000 jobs to content theft,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
which is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
that the motion picture and video industries

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
were employing 270,000 people.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And so the job losses that came with the Internet

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and all that content theft,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And some people think that string theory is tough.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
(Laughter)

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
It's the precise amount of harm

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
that comes to media companies

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
whenever a single copyrighted song or movie

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
gets pirated.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and made this law.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Some people think this number's a little bit large,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
are merely surprised

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Now when this law first passed,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And it was a big Christmas hit.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
(Laughter)

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.260
(Applause)

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
which is to say eight billion dollars-worth

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
of stolen media.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
(Applause)

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Or about 75,000 jobs.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
(Laughter)

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.260
(Applause)

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Now you might find copyright math strange,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
but that's because it's a field

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
that's best left to experts.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
So that's it for now.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
I hope you'll join me next time

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Thank you very much.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
(Applause)

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Thank you.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
(Applause)
