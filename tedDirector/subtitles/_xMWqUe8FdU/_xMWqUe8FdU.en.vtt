00:00:15.902 --> 00:00:19.062
Companies are losing control.

00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:20.667
What happens on Wall Street

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:22.998
no longer stays on Wall Street.

00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:26.884
What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube. (Laughter)

00:00:26.884 --> 00:00:31.100
Reputations are volatile. Loyalties are fickle.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.676
Management teams seem increasingly

00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:36.700
disconnected from their staff. (Laughter)

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.225
A recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believe

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:42.869
their employees are inspired by their firm.

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:45.016
However, in the same survey, only four percent

00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:47.459
of employees agreed.

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:49.509
Companies are losing control

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:53.151
of their customers and their employees.

00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:55.401
But are they really?

00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:58.698
I'm a marketer, and as a marketer, I know

00:00:58.698 --> 00:01:01.725
that I've never really been in control.

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:04.368
Your brand is what other people say about you

00:01:04.368 --> 00:01:07.563
when you're not in the room, the saying goes.

00:01:07.563 --> 00:01:11.694
Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies

00:01:11.694 --> 00:01:14.575
to be in that room now, 24/7.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.050
They can listen and join the conversation.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.250
In fact, they have more control over the loss of control

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.640
than ever before.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.690
They can design for it. But how?

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.256
First of all, they can give employees and customers more control.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:32.652
They can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas,

00:01:32.652 --> 00:01:36.030
knowledge, content, designs and product.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.478
They can give them more control over pricing,

00:01:38.478 --> 00:01:40.438
which is what the band Radiohead did

00:01:40.438 --> 00:01:43.512
with its pay-as-you-like online release of its album

00:01:43.512 --> 00:01:46.460
"In Rainbows." Buyers could determine the price,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.310
but the offer was exclusive, and only stood for a limited period of time.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.269
The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band.

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:58.466
The Danish chocolate company Anthon Berg

00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:01.648
opened a so-called "generous store" in Copenhagen.

00:02:01.648 --> 00:02:04.067
It asked customers to purchase chocolate

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:07.566
with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones.

00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:10.480
It turned transactions into interactions,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.033
and generosity into a currency.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.994
Companies can even give control to hackers.

00:02:15.994 --> 00:02:18.445
When Microsoft Kinect came out,

00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:22.596
the motion-controlled add-on to its Xbox gaming console,

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:25.532
it immediately drew the attention of hackers.

00:02:25.532 --> 00:02:29.425
Microsoft first fought off the hacks, but then shifted course

00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:32.288
when it realized that actively supporting the community

00:02:32.288 --> 00:02:34.047
came with benefits.

00:02:34.047 --> 00:02:37.283
The sense of co-ownership, the free publicity,

00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:40.300
the added value, all helped drive sales.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.629
The ultimate empowerment of customers

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.722
is to ask them not to buy.

00:02:45.722 --> 00:02:49.649
Outdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyers

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.618
to check out eBay for its used products

00:02:52.618 --> 00:02:56.185
and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones.

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:59.423
In an even more radical stance against consumerism,

00:02:59.423 --> 00:03:01.516
the company placed a "Don't Buy This Jacket"

00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:05.016
advertisement during the peak of shopping season.

00:03:05.016 --> 00:03:07.818
It may have jeopardized short-term sales,

00:03:07.818 --> 00:03:10.472
but it builds lasting, long-term loyalty

00:03:10.472 --> 00:03:12.642
based on shared values.

00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:15.862
Research has shown that giving employees more control

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:19.631
over their work makes them happier and more productive.

00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:22.600
The Brazilian company Semco Group famously

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.270
lets employees set their own work schedules

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.282
and even their salaries.

00:03:27.282 --> 00:03:29.553
Hulu and Netflix, among other companies,

00:03:29.553 --> 00:03:32.005
have open vacation policies.

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:34.923
Companies can give people more control,

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:39.195
but they can also give them less control.

00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:41.942
Traditional business wisdom holds that trust

00:03:41.942 --> 00:03:44.651
is earned by predictable behavior,

00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:47.296
but when everything is consistent and standardized,

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:50.219
how do you create meaningful experiences?

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.686
Giving people less control might be a wonderful way

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:55.948
to counter the abundance of choice

00:03:55.948 --> 00:03:57.630
and make them happier.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.443
Take the travel service Nextpedition.

00:04:00.443 --> 00:04:03.648
Nextpedition turns the trip into a game,

00:04:03.648 --> 00:04:07.220
with surprising twists and turns along the way.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.044
It does not tell the traveler where she's going

00:04:09.044 --> 00:04:12.113
until the very last minute, and information is provided

00:04:12.113 --> 00:04:16.096
just in time. Similarly, Dutch airline KLM

00:04:16.096 --> 00:04:19.281
launched a surprise campaign, seemingly randomly

00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:22.073
handing out small gifts to travelers

00:04:22.073 --> 00:04:24.235
en route to their destination.

00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:27.068
U.K.-based Interflora monitored Twitter

00:04:27.068 --> 00:04:29.578
for users who were having a bad day,

00:04:29.578 --> 00:04:33.669
and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers.

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.682
Is there anything companies can do to make

00:04:35.682 --> 00:04:38.789
their employees feel less pressed for time? Yes.

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.714
Force them to help others.

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:45.048
A recent study suggests that having employees complete

00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:47.859
occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day

00:04:47.859 --> 00:04:51.928
increases their sense of overall productivity.

00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:55.597
At Frog, the company I work for, we hold internal

00:04:55.597 --> 00:05:00.198
speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees,

00:05:00.198 --> 00:05:03.158
helping them get to know each other fast.

00:05:03.158 --> 00:05:06.480
By applying a strict process, we give them less control,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.214
less choice, but we enable more and richer social interactions.

00:05:11.214 --> 00:05:14.070
Companies are the makers of their fortunes,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.333
and like all of us, they are utterly exposed to serendipity.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:21.938
That should make them more humble, more vulnerable

00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:24.758
and more human.

00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:27.604
At the end of the day, as hyperconnectivity

00:05:27.604 --> 00:05:29.914
and transparency expose companies' behavior

00:05:29.914 --> 00:05:33.548
in broad daylight, staying true to their true selves

00:05:33.548 --> 00:05:37.099
is the only sustainable value proposition.

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.744
Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said,

00:05:39.744 --> 00:05:42.754
"What's interesting about you is you."

00:05:42.754 --> 00:05:45.808
For the true selves of companies to come through,

00:05:45.808 --> 00:05:48.439
openness is paramount,

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:51.431
but radical openness is not a solution,

00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:54.841
because when everything is open, nothing is open.

00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:59.758
"A smile is a door that is half open and half closed,"

00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:01.812
the author Jennifer Egan wrote.

00:06:01.812 --> 00:06:04.392
Companies can give their employees and customers

00:06:04.392 --> 00:06:07.879
more control or less. They can worry about how much

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.537
openness is good for them, and what needs to stay closed.

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:15.778
Or they can simply smile, and remain open

00:06:15.778 --> 00:06:17.395
to all possibilities.

00:06:17.395 --> 00:06:21.506
Thank you. (Applause)

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.461
(Applause)
