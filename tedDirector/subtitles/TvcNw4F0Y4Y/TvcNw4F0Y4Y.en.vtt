00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:14.590
How much do you get paid?

00:00:15.155 --> 00:00:17.043
Don't answer that out loud.

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.447
But put a number in your head.

00:00:20.017 --> 00:00:24.660
Now: How much do you think the person
sitting next to you gets paid?

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:27.335
Again, don't answer out loud.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.461
(Laughter)

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:31.502
At work, how much do you think

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:35.464
the person sitting in the cubicle
or the desk next to you gets paid?

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:36.643
Do you know?

00:00:36.977 --> 00:00:38.342
Should you know?

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:42.938
Notice, it's a little uncomfortable for me
to even ask you those questions.

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:46.112
But admit it -- you kind of want to know.

00:00:46.993 --> 00:00:50.518
Most of us are uncomfortable with the idea
of broadcasting our salary.

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:52.691
We're not supposed to tell our neighbors,

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:55.907
and we're definitely not supposed
to tell our office neighbors.

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:59.445
The assumed reason is that if everybody
knew what everybody got paid,

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.259
then all hell would break loose.

00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:03.384
There'd be arguments, there'd be fights,

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:05.597
there might even be a few people who quit.

00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:09.400
But what if secrecy is actually
the reason for all that strife?

00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:12.042
And what would happen
if we removed that secrecy?

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:16.590
What if openness actually increased
the sense of fairness and collaboration

00:01:16.614 --> 00:01:17.836
inside a company?

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.446
What would happen if we had
total pay transparency?

00:01:22.254 --> 00:01:23.571
For the past several years,

00:01:23.595 --> 00:01:26.508
I've been studying the corporate
and entrepreneurial leaders

00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:30.081
who question the conventional wisdom
about how to run a company.

00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:32.557
And the question of pay keeps coming up.

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:35.555
And the answers keep surprising.

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:38.265
It turns out that pay transparency --

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.399
sharing salaries openly
across a company --

00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:43.072
makes for a better workplace
for both the employee

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:44.683
and for the organization.

00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:48.461
When people don't know how their pay
compares to their peers',

00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:50.301
they're more likely to feel underpaid

00:01:50.325 --> 00:01:52.260
and maybe even discriminated against.

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:55.221
Do you want to work at a place
that tolerates the idea

00:01:55.245 --> 00:01:58.049
that you feel underpaid
or discriminated against?

00:01:58.697 --> 00:02:01.207
But keeping salaries secret
does exactly that,

00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:04.114
and it's a practice
as old as it is common,

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:06.766
despite the fact
that in the United States,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.240
the law protects an employee's right
to discuss their pay.

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:13.975
In one famous example from decades ago,

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.105
the management of Vanity Fair magazine

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.249
actually circulated a memo entitled:

00:02:18.273 --> 00:02:21.478
"Forbidding Discussion Among
Employees of Salary Received."

00:02:21.502 --> 00:02:24.824
"Forbidding" discussion among
employees of salary received.

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:27.629
Now that memo didn't sit well
with everybody.

00:02:27.653 --> 00:02:29.699
New York literary figures
Dorothy Parker,

00:02:29.723 --> 00:02:31.485
Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood,

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:33.950
all writers in the Algonquin Round Table,

00:02:33.974 --> 00:02:35.755
decided to stand up for transparency

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.511
and showed up for work the next day

00:02:37.535 --> 00:02:40.749
with their salary written on signs
hanging from their neck.

00:02:40.773 --> 00:02:42.321
(Laughter)

00:02:42.716 --> 00:02:44.291
Imagine showing up for work

00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:47.805
with your salary just written
across your chest for all to see.

00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:52.843
But why would a company even want
to discourage salary discussions?

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:56.199
Why do some people go along with it,
while others revolt against it?

00:02:57.906 --> 00:03:00.950
It turns out that in addition
to the assumed reasons,

00:03:00.974 --> 00:03:04.277
pay secrecy is actually a way
to save a lot of money.

00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:06.212
You see, keeping salaries secret

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:09.187
leads to what economists call
"information asymmetry."

00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:11.482
This is a situation where,
in a negotiation,

00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:14.504
one party has loads more
information than the other.

00:03:14.887 --> 00:03:18.297
And in hiring or promotion
or annual raise discussions,

00:03:18.321 --> 00:03:21.979
an employer can use that secrecy
to save a lot of money.

00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:25.142
Imagine how much better
you could negotiate for a raise

00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:26.973
if you knew everybody's salary.

00:03:29.612 --> 00:03:32.053
Economists warn that information asymmetry

00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:33.724
can cause markets to go awry.

00:03:33.748 --> 00:03:35.654
Someone leaves a pay stub on the copier,

00:03:35.678 --> 00:03:38.096
and suddenly everybody
is shouting at each other.

00:03:38.866 --> 00:03:40.572
In fact, they even warn

00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:45.413
that information asymmetry
can lead to a total market failure.

00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:48.109
And I think we're almost there.

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:49.299
Here's why:

00:03:49.323 --> 00:03:54.251
first, most employees have no idea
how their pay compares to their peers'.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:58.684
In a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees,

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:02.089
two-thirds of everyone who is paid
at the market rate

00:04:02.113 --> 00:04:04.345
said that they felt they were underpaid.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.915
And of everybody who felt
that they were underpaid,

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.892
60 percent said
that they intended to quit,

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:13.804
regardless of where they were --
underpaid, overpaid

00:04:13.828 --> 00:04:15.407
or right at the market rate.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.660
If you were part of this survey,
what would you say?

00:04:18.684 --> 00:04:19.960
Are you underpaid?

00:04:19.984 --> 00:04:22.309
Well, wait -- how do you even know,

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:24.466
because you're not allowed
to talk about it?

00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:28.510
Next, information asymmetry, pay secrecy,

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:31.313
makes it easier to ignore
the discrimination

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.804
that's already present
in the market today.

00:04:34.217 --> 00:04:37.914
In a 2011 report from the Institute
for Women's Policy Research,

00:04:37.938 --> 00:04:40.062
the gender wage gap
between men and women

00:04:40.086 --> 00:04:41.824
was 23 percent.

00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:45.070
This is where that 77 cents
on the dollar comes from.

00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:47.104
But in the Federal Government,

00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:49.191
where salaries are pinned
to certain levels

00:04:49.215 --> 00:04:51.255
and everybody knows
what those levels are,

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:53.364
the gender wage gap
shrinks to 11 percent --

00:04:53.388 --> 00:04:55.964
and this is before controlling
for any of the factors

00:04:55.988 --> 00:04:58.881
that economists argue over
whether or not to control for.

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:01.936
If we really want to close
the gender wage gap,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.448
maybe we should start
by opening up the payroll.

00:05:04.864 --> 00:05:08.086
If this is what total
market failure looks like,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.378
then openness remains
the only way to ensure fairness.

00:05:12.274 --> 00:05:14.775
Now, I realize that letting people
know what you make

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:16.445
might feel uncomfortable,

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:17.984
but isn't it less uncomfortable

00:05:18.008 --> 00:05:20.888
than always wondering
if you're being discriminated against,

00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:24.674
or if your wife or your daughter
or your sister is being paid unfairly?

00:05:25.353 --> 00:05:29.293
Openness remains the best way
to ensure fairness,

00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:31.230
and pay transparency does that.

00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:34.671
That's why entrepreneurial leaders
and corporate leaders

00:05:34.695 --> 00:05:37.488
have been experimenting
with sharing salaries for years.

00:05:37.512 --> 00:05:38.925
Like Dane Atkinson.

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.828
Dane is a serial entrepreneur
who started many companies

00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:44.434
in a pay secrecy condition

00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:47.811
and even used that condition
to pay two equally qualified people

00:05:47.835 --> 00:05:49.531
dramatically different salaries,

00:05:49.555 --> 00:05:51.724
depending on how well
they could negotiate.

00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:55.422
And Dane saw the strife
that happened as a result of this.

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:58.115
So when he started
his newest company, SumAll,

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.249
he committed to salary transparency
from the beginning.

00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:03.559
And the results have been amazing.

00:06:04.424 --> 00:06:06.046
And in study after study,

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.946
when people know
how they're being paid

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.999
and how that pay compares to their peers',

00:06:10.023 --> 00:06:12.956
they're more likely to work hard
to improve their performance,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.829
more likely to be engaged,
and they're less likely to quit.

00:06:15.853 --> 00:06:17.255
That's why Dane's not alone.

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:19.450
From technology start-ups like Buffer,

00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:23.261
to the tens of thousands
of employees at Whole Foods,

00:06:23.285 --> 00:06:26.452
where not only is your salary
available for everyone to see,

00:06:26.476 --> 00:06:29.476
but the performance data
for the store and for your department

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.419
is available on the company intranet

00:06:31.443 --> 00:06:32.665
for all to see.

00:06:33.985 --> 00:06:36.447
Now, pay transparency
takes a lot of forms.

00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:38.069
It's not one size fits all.

00:06:38.093 --> 00:06:40.589
Some post their salaries for all to see.

00:06:40.613 --> 00:06:42.914
Some only keep it inside the company.

00:06:42.938 --> 00:06:45.523
Some post the formula for calculating pay,

00:06:45.547 --> 00:06:47.321
and others post the pay levels

00:06:47.345 --> 00:06:49.123
and affix everybody to that level.

00:06:49.147 --> 00:06:51.196
So you don't have to make signs

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.744
for all of your employees
to wear around the office.

00:06:53.768 --> 00:06:56.682
And you don't have to be
the only one wearing a sign

00:06:56.706 --> 00:06:57.928
that you made at home.

00:06:58.494 --> 00:07:01.698
But we can all take greater steps
towards pay transparency.

00:07:02.233 --> 00:07:04.261
For those of you that have the authority

00:07:04.285 --> 00:07:06.079
to move forward towards transparency:

00:07:06.103 --> 00:07:07.578
it's time to move forward.

00:07:07.943 --> 00:07:10.411
And for those of you
that don't have that authority:

00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:12.414
it's time to stand up for your right to.

00:07:13.263 --> 00:07:14.988
So how much do you get paid?

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.813
And how does that compare
to the people you work with?

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.496
You should know.

00:07:21.312 --> 00:07:22.587
And so should they.

00:07:23.936 --> 00:07:25.104
Thank you.

00:07:25.128 --> 00:07:28.306
(Applause)
