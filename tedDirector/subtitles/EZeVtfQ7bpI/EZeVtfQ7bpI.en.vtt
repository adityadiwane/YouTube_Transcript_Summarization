00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.330
This is Aunt Zip from Sodom, North Carolina.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
She was 105 years old when I took this picture.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.330
She was always saying things that made me stop and think, like,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.330
"Time may be a great healer, but it ain't no beauty specialist."

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
(Laughter)

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
She said, "Be good to your friends.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
Why, without them, you'd be a total stranger."

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.330
(Laughter)

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
This is one of her songs.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
Let's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
Give him a big old hand.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
(Applause)

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
One, two, three, four.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:14.330
(Music)

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
Well, my true love's a black-eyed daisy;

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
if I don't see her, I go crazy.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
My true love lives up the river;

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
a few more jumps and I'll be with her.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.330
Now you've got to picture Aunt Zip at 105 years old in Sodom, North Carolina.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
I'd go up and learn these old songs from her.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
She couldn't sing much, couldn't play anymore.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
And I'd pull her out on the front porch.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.330
Down below, there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
A double outhouse over here on the side.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
And we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
so I'd sing, "Hey, hey!" and she'd just answer back with, "Black-eyed Susie."

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.330
Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
Well, she and I went blackberry picking.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
She got mad; I took a licking.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
Ducks on the millpond, geese in the ocean,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
Let's have the banjo.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
Well, we'll get married next Thanksgiving.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
I'll lay around; she'll make a living.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
She'll cook blackjacks, I'll cook gravy;

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
we'll have chicken someday, maybe.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.330
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey!

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.330
One more time now.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.330
Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
(Applause)

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
Thank you, Michael.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
This is Ralph Stanley.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
When I was going to college at University of California

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.330
taking majors in biology and art, he came to the campus.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
This was in 1968, I guess it was.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
And he played his bluegrass style of music,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.330
but near the end of the concert, he played the old timing style of banjo picking

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
that came from Africa, along with the banjo.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
It's called claw-hammer style, that he had learned from his mother and grandmother.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
I fell in love with that.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330
I went up to him and said, how can I learn that?

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
He said, well, you can go back to Clinch Mountain, where I'm from,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
or Asheville or Mount Airy, North Carolina --

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
some place that has a lot of music.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
Because there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.330
So I went back that very summer.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
I just fell in love with the culture and the people.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.330
And you know, I came back to school, I finished my degrees

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
You can imagine how excited they were.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
I've taken of some of my mentors.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.330
Just a few of them, but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.330
And play a little banjo. Let's do a little medley.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:05:52.330
(Music)

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:01.330
(Applause)

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks, who just passed away last year.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.330
He was one of the great American folk tale-tellers.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.330
The Old Jack tales that he had learned -- he talked like this,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
you could hardly understand him. But it was really wonderful.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.330
And he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.330
No running water, no electricity. A wonderful, wonderful guy.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
And you can look at more pictures.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.330
I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.330
of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.330
It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.330
and still played in the Southern mountains.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.330
Now, the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.330
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
It was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
It sounds something like this.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:08.330
(Music)

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.330
Well, have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.330
about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys?

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.330
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.330
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
Now, they were scouts in the rebels' army,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
they were known both far and wide.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.330
When the Yankees saw them coming, they'd lay down their guns and hide.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.330
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.330
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
Ain't that a sound?

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:04.330
(Applause)

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.330
Well, it was 1954, I guess it was.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville, Texas,

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
where I grew up in the early part of my life.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.330
My mom was driving; my brother and I were in the back seat.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
We were really mad at my mom. We looked out the window.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
You see, we'd just been to the grocery store,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.330
and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.330
that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
And, buddy, that made us mad.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330
Well, my mom didn't put up with much either, and she was driving, and she said,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.330
"You boys! You think you can have anything you want.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.330
You don't know how hard it is to earn money. Your dad works so hard.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
You think money grows on trees. You've never worked a day in your lives.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
You boys make me so mad. You're going to get a job this summer."

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.330
She pulled the car over; she said, "Get out of the car."

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.330
My brother and I stepped out of the car.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
There were about a hundred black folks out there picking.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
My mom grabbed us by the shoulders. She marched us out in the field.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
She went up to the foreman; she said,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
"I've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives."

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
Of course, we were just eight and 10.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.330
(Laughter)

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
She said, "Would you put them to work?"

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.330
Well, that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman:

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
in August in Texas -- it's hot.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
So he gave us each a cotton sack,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.330
about 10 feet long, about that big around, and we started picking.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.330
Now, cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
And if you don't know what you're doing,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
your hands are bleeding in no time.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
And my brother and I started to pick it,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
and our hands were startin' to bleed, and then -- "Mom!"

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
And Mom was just sitting by the car like this.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.330
She wasn't going to give up.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.330
Well, the foreman could see he was in over his head, I guess.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.330
He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:06.330
He just sang: "Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.330
Don't want it to leave me behind.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.330
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.330
Don't want it to leave me behind."

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.330
And from all around as people started singing and answering back, he sang:

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.330
"Good news, good news: Chariot's coming.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.330
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.330
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.330
And I don't want it to leave me behind."

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
Now, my brother and I had never heard anything like that

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.330
in our whole lives. It was so beautiful.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.330
We sat there all day picking cotton, without complaining,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
without crying, while they sang things like:

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.330
"Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan" and "Wade in the water,"

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
and "I done done," "This little light of mine."

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.330
Finally, by the end of the day,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.330
we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.330
But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
but my mother would never let us cash it.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.330
I'm 57; still have the check.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:12.330
Now, my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.330
But if you have children, you know it doesn't often work that way.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
No, we learned something else.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
The first thing I learned that day

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.330
was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
(Laughter)

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.330
And pretty much never did.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.330
But I also learned that some people in this world

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.330
do have to work that hard every day, and that was an eye-opener.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:41.330
And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:46.330
And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
Now, I was just a little eight-year-old boy that day

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.330
I wasn't even aware of music -- not even aware of it.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
But that day in the cotton field out there picking,

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
when those people started singing,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.330
I realized I was in the very heart of real music,

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
and that's where I've wanted to be ever since.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
Try this old song with me. I sing:

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.330
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.330
You sing: Don't want it to leave me behind.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.330
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.330
Don't want it to leave me behind.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.330
Good news, good news: Chariot's coming.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
And I don't want it to leave me --

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:40.330
It's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton, isn't it?

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.330
Let's try it one more time.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.330
There's a starry crown in heaven, I know.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.330
Don't want it to leave me behind.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.330
There's a starry crown in heaven, I know.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
Don't want it to leave me behind.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.330
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.330
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
And I don't want it to leave me behind.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.330
It was a few years ago, but I sort of remembered this story,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
and I told it at a concert.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
My mom was in the audience.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
After the -- she was glad to have a story about herself, of course,

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.330
but after the concert she came up and she said,

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.330
"David, I've got to tell you something.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.330
I set that whole thing up.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.330
I set it up with the foreman. I set it up with the owner of the land.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.330
I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.330
I didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though."

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.330
Let's try. Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.330
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.330
And I don't want it to leave me behind.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:14:02.330
(Applause)

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.330
Well, this is the steel guitar. It's an American-made instrument.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.330
It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
who later on made the Dobro, which is a wood-bodied instrument

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:17.330
with a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
It's usually played flat on your lap.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
before they had electric guitars, trying to make a loud guitar.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.330
And then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck,

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.330
just like that -- a nice Merlot works very well.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.330
Break it off, put it on your finger, and slide into the notes.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
This instrument pretty much saved my life.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.330
Fifteen years ago, 14 years ago, I guess, this year,

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:54.330
my wife and I lost our daughter, Sarah Jane, in a car accident,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:15:00.330
and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.330
And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.330
by going through such unbelievable grief,

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.330
just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:14.330
I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
I had to sit down and make lists, because I was ready to go;

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.330
I was ready to check out of this world.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
And you know, at the top of the list, of course,

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.330
were Jenny, and my son, Zeb, my parents -- I didn't want to hurt them.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.330
But then, when I thought about it beyond that,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
it was very simple things.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.330
I didn't care about -- I had a radio show,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.330
I have a radio show on public radio, "Riverwalk,"

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.330
I didn't care about that. I didn't care about awards or money or anything.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
Nothing. Nothing.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.330
On the list it would be stuff like,

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:49.330
seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring, the smell of new-mown hay,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:55.330
catching a wave and bodysurfing, the touch of a baby's hand,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.330
the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.330
listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.330
And for me, the sound of a steel guitar,

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.330
because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.330
And I would sit around with it, and I didn't know how to play it,

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:17.330
but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.330
And it was the only instrument that, of all the ones that I play,

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.330
that would really make that connection.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.330
This is a song that came out of that.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:58.330
(Music)

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.330
Well, I hear you're having trouble.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.330
Lord, I hate to hear that news.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:10.330
If you want to talk about it, you know, I will listen to you through.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:15.330
Words no longer say it; let me tell you what I always do.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:25.330
I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues.

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.330
People say, "Oh, snap out of it!"

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.330
Oh yeah, that's easier said than done.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.330
While you can hardly move, they're running around having all kinds of fun.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:47.330
Sometimes I think it's better just to sink way down in your funky mood

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:55.330
'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.330
Now, you can try to keep it all inside

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.330
with drink and drugs and cigarettes,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:09.330
but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:15.330
But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:24.330
Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.330
Open up now.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:13.330
(Applause)

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.330
Oh, I think I've got time to tell you about this. My dad was an inventor.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.330
We moved to California when Sputnik went up, in 1957.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.330
And he was working on gyroscopes;

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.330
he has a number of patents for that kind of thing.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.330
And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.330
They were about my age.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.330
John went on, and Michael did too,

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.330
to become some of the inventors of computer animation.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.330
Michael's dad was working on something called the computer.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.330
This was 1957, I was a little 10-year-old kid;

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.330
I didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one,

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.330
you know, what they were making. It was like a library,

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.330
just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see,

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.330
just floors and floors of these things,

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.330
and one of the engineers said,

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:56.330
some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.330
I thought, damn, those are going to be some big pants!

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.330
(Laughter)

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:07.330
So that Christmas -- maybe I've got time for this --

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:11.330
that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun-o-Rama chemistry set.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.330
Well, I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad; so did Michael.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.330
His great-granddad had been Eli Whitney,

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.330
the inventor of the cotton gin.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.330
So we looked in that --

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.330
this was a commercial chemistry set.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.330
It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see:

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.330
sulfur, potassium nitrate and charcoal.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.330
Man, we were only 10, but we knew that made gunpowder.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.330
We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.330
and we threw a match and phew, it flared up. Ah, it was great.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:40.330
Well, obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.330
So we went over into Michael's garage --

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.330
his dad had all kinds of stuff, and we put a pipe in the vice there,

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.330
and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe,

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.330
drilled a hole in the back of the pipe, took some of our firecrackers,

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.330
pulled out the fuses, tied them together, put them in the back there,

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.330
and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowder

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:03.330
down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top, in the garage.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.330
(Laughter)

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.330
We weren't stupid: we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.330
We stood back, we lit that thing,

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:15.330
and they flew out of there -- they went through that plywood like it was paper.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.330
Through the garage.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.330
Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.330
(Laughter)

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:28.330
We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.330
That was Pacific Palisades; it probably is still there, back there.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.330
Well, my brother heard that we had made gunpowder.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.330
He and his buddies, they were older, and they were pretty mean.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.330
They said they were going to beat us up

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.330
if we didn't make some gunpowder for them.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.330
We said, well, what are you going to do with it?

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:48.330
They said, we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.330
(Laughter)

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.330
Sure. We'll make you a big batch.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.330
(Laughter)

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.330
So we made them a big batch, and it was in my --

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.330
now, we'd just moved here. We'd just moved to California.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.330
Mom had redone the kitchen; Mom was gone that day. We had a pie tin.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.330
It became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.330
Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.330
He said, "Yeah, hey, it's melting. Yeah, the sulfur's melting.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.330
No problem. Yeah, you know."

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.330
It just flared up, and he turned around, and he looked like this.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.330
No hair, no eyelashes, no nothing.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.330
There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet;

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.330
the air was the just full of black smoke.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:34.330
She came home, she took that chemistry set away, and we never saw it again.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.330
But we thought of it often, because every time she'd cook tuna surprise

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.330
it made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.330
So I like to invent things too,

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:48.330
and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.330
When drum machines were new, I got to thinking,

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.330
why couldn't you take the oldest form of music, the hambone rhythms,

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.330
and combine it with the newest technology?

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.330
I call this Thunderwear.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.330
At that time, drum triggers were new.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:11.330
And so I put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.330
I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday;

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.330
I'm going to be doing some of the same ones.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:27.330
I have a trigger here, trigger here, here, here. Right there.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:36.330
It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off. Okay.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:43.330
Now, the drum triggers go out my tail here, into the drum machine,

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.330
and they can make various sounds, like drums.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.330
So let me put them all together. And also, I can change the sounds

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.330
by stepping on this pedal right here, and --

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.330
let me just close out here by doing you a little

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.330
hambone solo or something like this.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.330
Thank you, folks.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:12.330
(Applause)
