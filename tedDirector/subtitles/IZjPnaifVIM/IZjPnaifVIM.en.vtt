00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:15.603
So I thought I'd talk about identity.

00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:18.036
That's sort of an interesting
enough topic to me.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.214
And the reason was,
because when I was asked to do this,

00:00:21.238 --> 00:00:24.777
I'd just read, in one of the papers,
I can't remember,

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:28.180
something from someone at Facebook
saying, well,

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:29.820
"we need to make everybody
use their real names."

00:00:29.844 --> 00:00:32.178
and then that's basically
all the problems solved.

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:34.123
And that's so wrong,

00:00:34.147 --> 00:00:38.066
that's such a fundamentally,
reactionary view of identity,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.471
and it's going to get us
into all sorts of trouble.

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:41.829
And so what I thought I'd do

00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:45.834
is I'll explain four
sort of problems about it,

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:47.797
and then I'll suggest a solution,

00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:49.869
which hopefully you
might find interesting.

00:00:49.893 --> 00:00:51.920
So just to frame the problem,

00:00:51.944 --> 00:00:53.510
what does authenticity mean?

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:58.600
That's me, that's
a camera phone picture of me

00:00:58.624 --> 00:00:59.580
looking at a painting.

00:00:59.604 --> 00:01:00.345
[What's the Problem?]

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:01.477
That's a painting that was painted

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:03.519
by a very famous forger,

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:05.782
and because I'm not very good
at presentations,

00:01:05.806 --> 00:01:08.521
I already can't remember the name
that I wrote on my card.

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:12.399
And he was incarcerated
in, I think, Wakefield Prison

00:01:12.423 --> 00:01:15.965
for forging masterpieces by,
I think, French Impressionists.

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:19.144
And he's so good at it,
that when he was in prison,

00:01:19.168 --> 00:01:20.520
everybody in prison,
the governor and whatever,

00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:23.367
wanted him to paint masterpieces
to put on the walls,

00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:24.659
because they were so good.

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.043
And so that's a masterpiece,

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:28.042
which is a fake of a masterpiece,

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:34.705
and bonded into the canvas is a chip
which identifies that as a real fake,

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.237
if you see what I mean.

00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:37.429
(Laughter)

00:01:37.453 --> 00:01:39.672
So when we're talking about authenticity,

00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:45.134
it's a little more fractal than it appears
and that's a good example to show it.

00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:49.115
I tried to pick four problems
that will frame the issue properly.

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:50.663
So the first problem, I thought,

00:01:50.687 --> 00:01:52.215
Chip and PIN, right?

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:53.729
[Banks and legacies
bringing down the system from within]

00:01:53.753 --> 00:01:54.601
[Offline solutions do not work online]

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:57.217
I'm guessing everyone's got
a chip and PIN card, right?

00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:58.983
So why is that a good example?

00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:02.458
That's the example of how
legacy thinking about identity

00:02:02.482 --> 00:02:05.376
subverts the security
of a well-constructed system.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.167
That chip and PIN card
that's in your pocket

00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:11.409
has a little chip on it
that cost millions of pounds to develop,

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:12.986
is extremely secure,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.249
you can put scanning
electron microscopes on it,

00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:17.425
you can try and grind it down,
blah blah blah.

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.914
Those chips have never been broken,
whatever you read in the paper.

00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:24.148
And for a joke,
we take that super-secure chip

00:02:24.172 --> 00:02:27.662
and we bond it to a trivially
counterfeitable magnetic stripe

00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:31.284
and for very lazy criminals,
we still emboss the card.

00:02:31.308 --> 00:02:34.791
So if you're a criminal in a hurry
and you need to copy someone's card,

00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:36.992
you can just stick a piece of paper on it
and rub a pencil over it

00:02:37.016 --> 00:02:38.875
just to sort of speed things up.

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.971
And even more amusingly,
and on my debit card too,

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.362
we print the name and the SALT code
and everything else on the front too.

00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:47.701
Why?

00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:51.810
There is no earthly reason why your name
is printed on a chip and PIN card.

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:53.445
And if you think about it,

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.563
it's even more insidious and perverse
than it seems at first.

00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:58.377
Because the only people that benefit

00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:00.951
from having the name
on the card are criminals.

00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:02.592
You know what your name is, right?

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:03.493
(Laughter)

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:05.745
And when you go into
a shop and buy something,

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.705
it's a PIN, he doesn't care
what the name is.

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:11.364
The only place where you ever have
to write your name on the back

00:03:11.388 --> 00:03:12.534
is in America at the moment.

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:13.745
And whenever I go to America,

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.545
and I have to pay with a mag stripe
on the back of the card,

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.427
I always sign it Carlos Tethers anyway,

00:03:17.451 --> 00:03:19.235
just as a security mechanism,

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:21.473
because if a transaction
ever gets disputed,

00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:23.450
and it comes back and it says Dave Birch,

00:03:23.474 --> 00:03:25.189
I know it must have been a criminal,

00:03:25.213 --> 00:03:28.024
because I would never sign it Dave Birch.

00:03:28.048 --> 00:03:29.714
(Laughter)

00:03:29.738 --> 00:03:31.505
So if you drop your card in the street,

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:33.277
it means a criminal
can pick it up and read it.

00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:33.982
They know the name,

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:35.911
from the name they can find the address,

00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:38.326
and then they can go off
and buy stuff online.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.538
Why do we put the name on the card?

00:03:40.562 --> 00:03:44.257
Because we think identity
is something to do with names,

00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:47.952
and because we're rooted
in the idea of the identity card,

00:03:47.976 --> 00:03:49.068
which obsesses us.

00:03:49.092 --> 00:03:51.664
And I know it crashed and burned
a couple of years ago,

00:03:51.688 --> 00:03:56.219
but if you're someone in politics
or the home office or whatever,

00:03:56.243 --> 00:03:57.624
and you think about identity,

00:03:57.648 --> 00:04:00.839
you can only think of identity
in terms of cards with names on them.

00:04:00.863 --> 00:04:03.985
And that's very subversive
in a modern world.

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.241
So the second example I thought I'd use

00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:08.307
is chatrooms.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:09.111
[Chatrooms and Children]

00:04:09.135 --> 00:04:11.301
I'm very proud of that picture,
that's my son

00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:15.377
playing in his band with his friends
for the first-ever gig,

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:17.346
I believe you call it, where he got paid.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.133
(Laughter)

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.011
And I love that picture.

00:04:20.035 --> 00:04:22.777
I like the picture of him
getting into medical school a lot better,

00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:23.477
(Laughter)

00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:25.590
I like that picture for the moment.

00:04:25.614 --> 00:04:26.565
Why do I use that picture?

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:31.654
Because that was very interesting,
watching that experience as an old person.

00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:33.097
So him and his friends,

00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:35.975
they get together, they booked a room,
like a church hall,

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:37.825
and they got all their friends
who had bands,

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.135
and they got them together,

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.636
and they do it all on Facebook,

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.434
and then they sell tickets,
and the first band on the -

00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:45.319
I was going to say "menu,"

00:04:45.343 --> 00:04:47.629
that's probably
the wrong word for it, isn't it?

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:49.559
The first band on the list of bands

00:04:49.583 --> 00:04:54.116
that appears at some
public music performance of some kind

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.285
gets the sales from the first 20 tickets,

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.105
then the next band gets the next 20,

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:59.091
and so on.

00:04:59.115 --> 00:05:00.427
They were at the bottom of the menu,

00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:02.545
they were like fifth,
I thought they had no chance.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.807
He actually got 20 quid. Fantastic, right?

00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:06.904
But my point is,
that all worked perfectly,

00:05:06.928 --> 00:05:09.685
except on the web.

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:11.878
So they're sitting on Facebook,

00:05:11.902 --> 00:05:14.744
and they're sending these messages
and arranging things

00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:17.063
and they don't know who anybody is, right?

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:18.694
That's the big problem
we're trying to solve.

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:20.661
If only they were using the real names,

00:05:20.685 --> 00:05:23.352
Then you wouldn't be worried
about them on the Internet.

00:05:23.376 --> 00:05:24.597
And so when he says to me,

00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:28.963
"Oh, I want to go to a chatroom
to talk about guitars" or something,

00:05:28.987 --> 00:05:32.212
I'm like, "oh, well,
I don't want you to go into a chatroom

00:05:32.236 --> 00:05:35.570
to talk about guitars, because
they might not all be your friends,

00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:37.833
and some of the people
that are in the chatroom

00:05:37.857 --> 00:05:41.390
might be perverts and teachers
and vicars."

00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:43.215
(Laughter)

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:46.144
I mean, they generally are,
when you look in the paper, right?

00:05:46.168 --> 00:05:49.200
So I want to know who
all the people in the chatroom are.

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.939
So okay, you can go in the chatroom,

00:05:50.963 --> 00:05:53.963
but only if everybody in the chatroom
is using their real names,

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:58.328
and they submit full copies
of their police report.

00:05:58.352 --> 00:06:01.448
But of course, if anybody
in the chatroom asked for his real name,

00:06:01.472 --> 00:06:03.690
I'd say no.
You can't give them your real name.

00:06:03.714 --> 00:06:06.390
Because what happens
if they turn out to be perverts,

00:06:06.414 --> 00:06:09.063
and teachers and whatever.

00:06:09.087 --> 00:06:10.802
So you have this odd sort of paradox

00:06:10.826 --> 00:06:13.133
where I'm happy for him
to go into this space

00:06:13.157 --> 00:06:15.075
if I know who everybody else is,

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.438
but I don't want anybody else
to know who he is.

00:06:17.462 --> 00:06:19.614
And so you get
this sort of logjam around identity

00:06:19.638 --> 00:06:21.250
where you want full disclosure
from everybody else,

00:06:21.274 --> 00:06:22.545
but not from yourself.

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.552
And there's no progress, we get stuck.

00:06:24.576 --> 00:06:26.862
And so the chatroom thing
doesn't work properly,

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:31.227
and it's a very bad way
of thinking about identity.

00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:34.162
So on my RSS feed,
I saw this thing about -

00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:36.758
I just said something bad
about my RSS feed, didn't I?

00:06:36.782 --> 00:06:38.513
I should stop saying it like that.

00:06:38.537 --> 00:06:40.046
For some random reason, I can't imagine,

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.202
something about cheerleaders
turned up in my inbox.

00:06:42.226 --> 00:06:44.179
And I read this story about cheerleaders,

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:45.628
and it's a fascinating story.

00:06:45.652 --> 00:06:47.843
This happened a couple of years ago
in the U.S.

00:06:47.867 --> 00:06:50.568
There were some cheerleaders
in a team at a high school

00:06:50.592 --> 00:06:53.451
in the U.S., and they said mean things

00:06:53.475 --> 00:06:54.637
about their cheerleading coach,

00:06:54.661 --> 00:06:56.848
as I'm sure kids do
about all of their teachers

00:06:56.872 --> 00:06:58.175
all of the time,

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.255
and somehow the cheerleading coach
found out about this.

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:01.719
She was very upset.

00:07:01.743 --> 00:07:03.886
And so she went to one of the girls,
and said,

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.006
"you have to give me
your Facebook password."

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.695
I read this all the time,
where even at some universities

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:10.595
and places of education,

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:12.324
kids are forced to hand over
their Facebook passwords.

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:15.079
So you've got to give them
your Facebook password.

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:15.952
She was a kid!

00:07:15.976 --> 00:07:17.138
What she should have said

00:07:17.162 --> 00:07:18.368
is, "my lawyer will be calling you

00:07:18.392 --> 00:07:19.158
first thing in the morning.

00:07:19.182 --> 00:07:21.279
It's an outrageous imposition

00:07:21.303 --> 00:07:23.138
on my 4th Amendment right to privacy,

00:07:23.162 --> 00:07:23.923
and you're going to be sued

00:07:23.947 --> 00:07:24.518
for all the money you've got."

00:07:24.542 --> 00:07:25.574
That's what she should have said.

00:07:25.598 --> 00:07:26.553
But she's a kid,

00:07:26.577 --> 00:07:28.372
so she hands over the password.

00:07:28.396 --> 00:07:30.422
The teacher can't log into Facebook,

00:07:30.446 --> 00:07:33.594
because the school
has blocked access to Facebook.

00:07:33.618 --> 00:07:35.507
So the teacher can't log into Facebook
until she gets home.

00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:37.205
So the girl tells her friends,

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:37.766
guess what happened?

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.362
The teacher logged in, she knows.

00:07:39.386 --> 00:07:41.203
So the girls just all logged into Facebook
on their phones,

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:43.070
and deleted their profiles.

00:07:43.094 --> 00:07:45.955
And so when the teacher logged in,
there was nothing there.

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:51.607
My point is, those identities,
they don't think about them the same way.

00:07:51.631 --> 00:07:55.336
Identity is, especially when
you're a teenager, a fluid thing.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.941
You have lots of identities.

00:07:56.965 --> 00:07:59.191
And you can have an identity,
you don't like it,

00:07:59.215 --> 00:08:02.787
because it's subverted in some way,
or it's insecure, or it's inappropriate,

00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:04.869
you just delete it and get another one.

00:08:04.893 --> 00:08:08.193
The idea that you have an identity
that's given to you by someone,

00:08:08.217 --> 00:08:09.012
the government or whatever,

00:08:09.036 --> 00:08:11.131
and you have to stick with that identity
and use it in all places,

00:08:11.155 --> 00:08:12.839
that's absolutely wrong.

00:08:12.863 --> 00:08:15.871
Why would you want to really know
who someone was on Facebook,

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:18.753
unless you wanted to abuse them
and harass them in some way?

00:08:18.777 --> 00:08:21.384
And it just doesn't work properly.

00:08:21.408 --> 00:08:23.598
And my fourth example is
there are some cases

00:08:23.622 --> 00:08:26.031
where you really want to be -

00:08:26.055 --> 00:08:29.601
In case you're wondering,
that's me at the G20 protest.

00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:33.277
I wasn't actually at the G20 protest,
but I had a meeting at a bank

00:08:33.301 --> 00:08:36.710
on the day of the G20 protest,
and I got an email from the bank

00:08:36.734 --> 00:08:41.271
saying please don't wear a suit,
because it'll inflame the protesters.

00:08:41.295 --> 00:08:43.045
I look pretty good in a suit, frankly,

00:08:43.069 --> 00:08:44.735
so you can see why it would drive them

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:46.236
into an anti-capitalist frenzy.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:46.771
(Laughter)

00:08:46.795 --> 00:08:47.700
So I thought, well, look.

00:08:47.724 --> 00:08:50.869
If I don't want to inflame the protesters,

00:08:50.893 --> 00:08:51.785
the obvious thing to do

00:08:51.809 --> 00:08:53.190
is go dressed as a protester.

00:08:53.214 --> 00:08:55.208
So I went dressed completely in black,

00:08:55.232 --> 00:08:57.092
you know, with a black balaclava,

00:08:57.116 --> 00:08:57.926
I had black gloves on,

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.563
but I've taken them off
to sign the visitor's book.

00:08:59.587 --> 00:09:00.135
(Laughter)

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:02.318
I'm wearing black trousers, black boots,

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:03.724
I'm dressed completely in black.

00:09:03.748 --> 00:09:04.898
I go into the bank at 10 o'clock,

00:09:04.922 --> 00:09:05.863
go, "Hi, I'm Dave Birch,

00:09:05.887 --> 00:09:07.139
I've got a 3 o'clock
with so and so there."

00:09:07.163 --> 00:09:08.580
Sure. They sign me in.

00:09:08.604 --> 00:09:11.351
There's my visitor's badge.

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:12.242
(Laughter)

00:09:12.266 --> 00:09:13.560
So this nonsense

00:09:13.584 --> 00:09:15.614
about you've got to have real names
on Facebook and whatever,

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.849
that gets you that kind of security.

00:09:17.873 --> 00:09:22.368
That gets you security theater,
where there's no actual security,

00:09:22.392 --> 00:09:25.706
but people are sort of playing parts
in a play about security.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.831
And as long as
everybody learns their lines,

00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:28.367
everyone's happy.

00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:31.231
But it's not real security.

00:09:31.255 --> 00:09:34.473
Especially because I hate banks
more than the G20 protesters do,

00:09:34.497 --> 00:09:35.658
because I work for them.

00:09:35.682 --> 00:09:38.485
I know that things are actually worse
than these guys think.

00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:40.282
(Laughter)

00:09:41.872 --> 00:09:46.942
But suppose I worked
next to somebody in a bank

00:09:46.966 --> 00:09:49.974
who was doing something.

00:09:56.744 --> 00:09:58.910
Suppose I was sitting
next to a rogue trader,

00:09:58.934 --> 00:10:01.213
and I want to report it
to the boss of the bank.

00:10:01.237 --> 00:10:02.629
So I log on to do
a little bit of whistleblowing.

00:10:02.653 --> 00:10:05.094
I send a message,
this guy's a rogue trader.

00:10:05.118 --> 00:10:06.892
That message is meaningless

00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:09.840
if you don't know
that I'm a trader at the bank.

00:10:09.864 --> 00:10:11.769
If that message just comes from anybody,

00:10:11.793 --> 00:10:14.426
it has zero information value.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.919
There's no point in sending that message.

00:10:18.463 --> 00:10:21.206
But if I have to prove who I am,

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.611
I'll never send that message.

00:10:22.635 --> 00:10:26.464
It's just like the nurse in the hospital
reporting the drunk surgeon.

00:10:26.488 --> 00:10:29.385
That message will only happen
if I'm anonymous.

00:10:29.409 --> 00:10:34.176
So the system has to have ways
of providing anonymity there,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.439
otherwise we don't get
where we want to get to.

00:10:36.463 --> 00:10:39.109
So four issues.
So what are we going to do about it?

00:10:39.133 --> 00:10:43.796
Well, what we tend to do about it

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.184
is we think about Orwell space.

00:10:46.208 --> 00:10:49.330
And we try to make electronic versions

00:10:49.354 --> 00:10:51.637
of the identity card
that we got rid of in 1953.

00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:54.394
So we think if we had a card,

00:10:54.418 --> 00:10:55.733
call it a Facebook login,

00:10:55.757 --> 00:10:57.030
which proves who you are,

00:10:57.054 --> 00:10:58.921
and I make you carry it all the time,

00:10:58.945 --> 00:10:59.739
that solves the problem.

00:10:59.763 --> 00:11:01.897
And of course, for all those reasons
I've just outlined,

00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:02.889
it doesn't, and it might, actually,

00:11:02.913 --> 00:11:03.961
make some problems worse.

00:11:03.985 --> 00:11:06.784
The more times you're forced
to use your real identity,

00:11:06.808 --> 00:11:09.024
certainly in transactional terms,

00:11:09.048 --> 00:11:11.906
the more likely that identity
is to get stolen and subverted.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.170
The goal is to stop people
from using identity

00:11:14.194 --> 00:11:16.347
in transactions which don't need identity,

00:11:16.371 --> 00:11:18.856
which is actually almost all transactions.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.153
Almost all of the transactions you do

00:11:21.177 --> 00:11:22.841
are not, who are you?

00:11:22.865 --> 00:11:24.975
They're, are you allowed to drive the car,

00:11:24.999 --> 00:11:26.523
are you allowed in the building,

00:11:26.547 --> 00:11:27.380
are you over 18,

00:11:27.404 --> 00:11:29.495
etcetera, etcetera.

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.326
So my suggestion-I, like James,

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.487
think that there should be
a resurgence of interest in R &amp; D.

00:11:34.511 --> 00:11:35.272
I think this is a solvable problem.

00:11:35.296 --> 00:11:37.092
It's something we can do about.

00:11:37.116 --> 00:11:39.040
Naturally, in these circumstances,

00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:40.414
I turn to Doctor Who.

00:11:40.438 --> 00:11:42.550
Because in this,

00:11:42.574 --> 00:11:44.194
as in so many other walks of life,

00:11:44.218 --> 00:11:47.147
Doctor Who has already shown
us the answer.

00:11:47.171 --> 00:11:47.961
So I should say,

00:11:47.985 --> 00:11:50.292
for some of our foreign visitors,

00:11:50.316 --> 00:11:54.146
Doctor Who is the greatest
living scientist in England,

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.723
(Laughter)

00:11:55.747 --> 00:11:58.523
and a beacon of truth and enlightenment
to all of us.

00:11:58.547 --> 00:12:02.593
And this is Doctor Who
with his psychic paper.

00:12:02.617 --> 00:12:04.763
Come on, you guys must have seen
Doctor Who's psychic paper.

00:12:04.787 --> 00:12:06.763
You're not nerds if you say yes.

00:12:06.787 --> 00:12:08.899
Who's seen Doctor Who's psychic paper?

00:12:08.923 --> 00:12:11.329
Oh right, you were in the library
the whole time studying I guess.

00:12:11.353 --> 00:12:13.399
Is that what you're going to tell us?

00:12:13.423 --> 00:12:14.661
Doctor Who's psychic paper

00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:16.781
is when you hold up the psychic paper,

00:12:16.805 --> 00:12:18.319
the person, in their brain,

00:12:18.343 --> 00:12:20.668
sees the thing that they need to see.

00:12:20.692 --> 00:12:23.027
So I want to show you a British passport,

00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:24.053
I hold up the psychic paper,

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:25.533
you see a British passport.

00:12:25.557 --> 00:12:27.329
I want to get into a party,

00:12:27.353 --> 00:12:28.936
I hold up the psychic paper,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.389
I show you a party invitation.

00:12:30.413 --> 00:12:32.464
You see what you want to see.

00:12:32.488 --> 00:12:35.679
So what I'm saying is we need
to make an electronic version of that,

00:12:35.703 --> 00:12:37.876
but with one tiny, tiny change,

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.472
which is that it'll only show you
the British passport

00:12:40.496 --> 00:12:41.688
if I've actually got one.

00:12:41.712 --> 00:12:42.907
It'll only show you the party invitation

00:12:42.931 --> 00:12:44.304
if I actually have one.

00:12:44.328 --> 00:12:47.328
It will only show you that I'm over 18
if I actually am over 18.

00:12:47.352 --> 00:12:49.652
But nothing else.

00:12:49.676 --> 00:12:54.427
So you're the bouncer at the pub,
you need to know that I'm over 18,

00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:56.451
instead of showing you my driving license,

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:58.292
which shows you I know how to drive,

00:12:58.316 --> 00:13:00.888
what my name is, my address,
all these kind of things,

00:13:00.912 --> 00:13:02.467
I show you my psychic paper,

00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:05.633
and all it tells you is
am I over 18 or not.

00:13:05.657 --> 00:13:07.069
Right.

00:13:07.093 --> 00:13:08.407
Is that just a pipe dream?

00:13:08.431 --> 00:13:10.100
Of course not, otherwise
I wouldn't be here talking to you.

00:13:10.124 --> 00:13:13.184
So in order to build that
and make it work,

00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:15.955
I'm only going to name these things,
I'll not go into them,

00:13:15.979 --> 00:13:17.132
we need a plan,

00:13:17.156 --> 00:13:18.381
which is we're going to build this

00:13:18.405 --> 00:13:20.405
as an infrastructure for everybody to use,

00:13:20.429 --> 00:13:22.259
to solve all of these problems.

00:13:22.283 --> 00:13:24.307
We're going to make a utility,

00:13:24.331 --> 00:13:25.855
the utility has to be universal,

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:26.738
you can use it everywhere,

00:13:26.762 --> 00:13:29.953
I'm just giving you little flashes
of the technology as we go along.

00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:31.336
That's a Japanese ATM,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.444
the fingerprint template
is stored inside the mobile phone.

00:13:34.468 --> 00:13:35.431
So when you want to draw money out,

00:13:35.455 --> 00:13:36.928
you put the mobile phone on the ATM,

00:13:36.952 --> 00:13:38.193
and touch your finger,

00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:40.265
your fingerprint goes through
to the phone,

00:13:40.289 --> 00:13:41.956
the phone says yes, that's whoever,

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.160
and the ATM then gives you some money.

00:13:44.184 --> 00:13:47.197
It has to be a utility
that you can use everywhere.

00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:48.983
It has to be absolutely convenient,

00:13:49.007 --> 00:13:52.150
that's me going into the pub.

00:13:52.174 --> 00:13:54.943
All the device on the door
of the pub is allowed is,

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:58.616
is this person over 18
and not barred from the pub?

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.946
And so the idea is,
you touch your ID card to the door,

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.905
and if I am allowed in,
it shows my picture,

00:14:03.929 --> 00:14:05.366
if I'm not allowed in,
it shows a red cross.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.981
It doesn't disclose any other information.

00:14:07.005 --> 00:14:08.893
It has to have no special gadgets.

00:14:08.917 --> 00:14:10.528
That can only mean one thing,

00:14:10.552 --> 00:14:12.219
following on from Ross's statement,

00:14:12.243 --> 00:14:13.697
which I agree with completely.

00:14:13.721 --> 00:14:14.809
If it means no special gadgets,

00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:16.183
it has to run on a mobile phone.

00:14:16.207 --> 00:14:17.286
That's the only choice we have,

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.165
we have to make it work on mobile phones.

00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:20.099
There are 6.6 billion

00:14:20.123 --> 00:14:21.023
mobile phone subscriptions.

00:14:21.047 --> 00:14:23.059
My favorite statistic of all time,

00:14:23.083 --> 00:14:25.036
only 4 billion toothbrushes in the world.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.095
That means something,

00:14:26.119 --> 00:14:27.352
I don't know what.

00:14:27.376 --> 00:14:27.730
(Laughter)

00:14:27.754 --> 00:14:31.193
I rely on our futurologists to tell me.

00:14:31.217 --> 00:14:32.903
It has to be a utility
which is extensible.

00:14:32.927 --> 00:14:34.188
So it has to be something

00:14:34.212 --> 00:14:35.778
that anybody could build on.

00:14:35.802 --> 00:14:37.666
Anybody should be able
to use this infrastructure,

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.120
you don't need permissions,
licenses, whatever,

00:14:40.144 --> 00:14:43.311
anyone should be able
to write some code to do this.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.417
You know what symmetry is,

00:14:46.441 --> 00:14:48.764
so you don't need a picture of it.

00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:49.928
This is how we're going to do it.

00:14:49.952 --> 00:14:50.962
We're going to do it using phones,

00:14:50.986 --> 00:14:51.588
and we're going to do it

00:14:51.612 --> 00:14:52.744
using mobile proximity.

00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:53.880
I'm going to suggest to you

00:14:53.904 --> 00:14:55.216
the technology to implement

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.502
Doctor Who's psychic paper

00:14:56.526 --> 00:14:58.146
is already here, and if any of you

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.625
have got one of the new
Barclay's debit cards

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:01.854
with the contactless interface on it,

00:15:01.878 --> 00:15:03.545
you've already got that technology.

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:05.469
If you've ever been up to the big city,

00:15:05.493 --> 00:15:06.970
and used an Oyster card at all,

00:15:06.994 --> 00:15:09.065
does that ring any bells to anybody?

00:15:09.089 --> 00:15:09.811
The technology already exists.

00:15:09.835 --> 00:15:11.201
The first phones

00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:11.831
that have the technology built in,

00:15:11.855 --> 00:15:14.130
the Google Nexus, the S2,

00:15:14.154 --> 00:15:14.839
the Samsung Wifi 7.9,

00:15:14.863 --> 00:15:16.331
the first phones that have

00:15:16.355 --> 00:15:17.423
the technology built into them

00:15:17.447 --> 00:15:18.257
are already in the shops.

00:15:18.281 --> 00:15:19.969
So the idea that the gas man

00:15:19.993 --> 00:15:22.161
can turn up at my mom's door

00:15:22.185 --> 00:15:24.363
and he can show my mom his phone,

00:15:24.387 --> 00:15:25.698
and she can tap it with her phone,

00:15:25.722 --> 00:15:28.005
and it will come up with green
if he really is from British Gas

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:29.217
and allowed in,

00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:30.887
and it'll come up with red if he isn't,

00:15:30.911 --> 00:15:31.497
end of story.

00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:33.347
We have the technology to do that.

00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:34.582
And what's more,

00:15:34.606 --> 00:15:36.727
although some of those things
sounded a bit counter-intuitive,

00:15:36.751 --> 00:15:39.515
like proving I'm over 18
without proving who I am,

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:41.740
the cryptography to do that
not only exists,

00:15:41.764 --> 00:15:43.969
it's extremely well-known
and well-understood.

00:15:43.993 --> 00:15:46.624
Digital signatures, the blinding
of public key certificates,

00:15:46.648 --> 00:15:48.368
these technologies have been around
for a while,

00:15:48.392 --> 00:15:50.440
we've just had no way
of packaging them up.

00:15:50.464 --> 00:15:53.157
So the technology already exists.

00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:56.845
We know it works,

00:15:56.869 --> 00:15:58.593
There are a few examples
of the technology being used

00:15:58.617 --> 00:16:00.263
in experimental places.

00:16:00.287 --> 00:16:01.591
That's London Fashion Week,

00:16:01.615 --> 00:16:03.465
where we built a system with O2,

00:16:03.489 --> 00:16:06.232
that's for the Wireless Festival
in Hyde Park,

00:16:06.256 --> 00:16:07.355
you can see the persons

00:16:07.379 --> 00:16:09.116
walking in with their VIP band,

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:09.600
it's just being checked

00:16:09.624 --> 00:16:10.700
by the Nokia phone
that's reading the band.

00:16:10.724 --> 00:16:12.398
I'm only putting those up to show you

00:16:12.422 --> 00:16:13.627
these things are prosaic,

00:16:13.651 --> 00:16:15.509
this stuff works in these environments.

00:16:15.533 --> 00:16:16.962
They don't need to be special.

00:16:16.986 --> 00:16:22.881
So finally, I know that you can do this,

00:16:23.789 --> 00:16:26.669
because if you saw
the episode of Doctor Who,

00:16:26.693 --> 00:16:28.569
the Easter special of Doctor Who,

00:16:28.593 --> 00:16:31.945
where he went to Mars in a bus,

00:16:31.969 --> 00:16:33.507
I should say again
for our foreign students,

00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:35.180
that doesn't happen every episode.

00:16:35.204 --> 00:16:36.651
This was a very special case.

00:16:36.675 --> 00:16:39.892
So in the episode where
he goes to Mars in a London bus,

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.565
I can't show you the clip,

00:16:41.589 --> 00:16:44.589
due to the outrageous restrictions
of Queen Anne-style copyright

00:16:44.613 --> 00:16:46.482
by the BBC,

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:49.221
but in the episode
where he goes to Mars in a London bus,

00:16:49.245 --> 00:16:53.355
Doctor Who is clearly shown
getting on to the bus

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:54.655
with the Oyster card reader

00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:56.223
using his psychic paper.

00:16:56.247 --> 00:16:58.315
Which proves that psychic paper

00:16:58.339 --> 00:17:00.030
has an MSE interface.

00:17:00.054 --> 00:17:02.064
Thank you very much.
