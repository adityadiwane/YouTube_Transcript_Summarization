00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:16.116
What would be a good end of life?

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.106
And I'm talking about the very end.

00:00:18.106 --> 00:00:21.839
I'm talking about dying.

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.596
We all think a lot about how to live well.

00:00:25.596 --> 00:00:30.028
I'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well.

00:00:30.028 --> 00:00:32.148
I'm not a geriatrician.

00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:34.852
I design reading programs for preschoolers.

00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:36.678
What I know about this topic

00:00:36.678 --> 00:00:41.080
comes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.785
In the last few years, I helped two friends

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:46.026
have the end of life they wanted.

00:00:46.026 --> 00:00:49.354
Jim and Shirley Modini spent their 68 years of marriage

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:52.328
living off the grid on their 1,700-acre ranch

00:00:52.328 --> 00:00:54.419
in the mountains of Sonoma County.

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:58.343
They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet

00:00:58.343 --> 00:01:01.650
so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.883
for the bears and lions and so many other things

00:01:03.883 --> 00:01:05.490
that lived there.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.503
This was their dream.

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:10.786
I met Jim and Shirley in their 80s.

00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:14.267
They were both only children who chose not to have kids.

00:01:14.267 --> 00:01:16.846
As we became friends, I became their trustee

00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:18.675
and their medical advocate,

00:01:18.675 --> 00:01:20.683
but more importantly, I became

00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:24.442
the person who managed their end-of-life experiences.

00:01:24.442 --> 00:01:28.115
And we learned a few things about how to have a good end.

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:30.086
In their final years, Jim and Shirley

00:01:30.086 --> 00:01:34.086
faced cancers, fractures, infections, neurological illness.

00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:35.159
It's true.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.396
At the end, our bodily functions

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:40.177
and independence are declining to zero.

00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:43.331
What we found is that, with a plan and the right people,

00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:46.885
quality of life can remain high.

00:01:46.885 --> 00:01:48.324
The beginning of the end is triggered

00:01:48.324 --> 00:01:51.215
by a mortality awareness event, and during this time,

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:55.453
Jim and Shirley chose ACR nature preserves

00:01:55.453 --> 00:01:57.985
to take their ranch over when they were gone.

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:01.565
This gave them the peace of mind to move forward.

00:02:01.565 --> 00:02:05.041
It might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.257
But one day, you're going to say, "This thing is going to get me."

00:02:08.257 --> 00:02:09.813
Jim and Shirley spent this time

00:02:09.813 --> 00:02:11.816
letting friends know that their end was near

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:16.872
and that they were okay with that.

00:02:16.872 --> 00:02:19.721
Dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness

00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:21.292
are different.

00:02:21.292 --> 00:02:25.594
In both cases, last days are about quiet reassurance.

00:02:25.594 --> 00:02:29.353
Jim died first. He was conscious until the very end,

00:02:29.353 --> 00:02:31.540
but on his last day he couldn't talk.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.653
Through his eyes, we knew when he needed to hear again,

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.489
"It is all set, Jim. We're going to take care of Shirley

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.658
right here at the ranch,

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:41.487
and ACR's going to take care of your wildlife forever."

00:02:41.487 --> 00:02:44.179
From this experience I'm going to share five practices.

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:45.994
I've put worksheets online,

00:02:45.994 --> 00:02:48.777
so if you'd like, you can plan your own end.

00:02:48.777 --> 00:02:51.244
It starts with a plan.

00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:53.761
Most people say, "I'd like to die at home."

00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:55.986
Eighty percent of Americans die in a hospital

00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:57.490
or a nursing home.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.145
Saying we'd like to die at home is not a plan.

00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:04.362
A lot of people say, "If I get like that, just shoot me."

00:03:04.362 --> 00:03:06.858
This is not a plan either; this is illegal.

00:03:06.858 --> 00:03:10.912
(Laughter)

00:03:10.912 --> 00:03:13.739
A plan involves answering

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.097
straightforward questions about the end you want.

00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:18.794
Where do you want to be when you're no longer independent?

00:03:18.794 --> 00:03:21.691
What do you want in terms of medical intervention?

00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:24.065
And who's going to make sure your plan is followed?

00:03:24.065 --> 00:03:25.542
You will need advocates.

00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:27.173
Having more than one increases your chance

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:28.933
of getting the end you want.

00:03:28.933 --> 00:03:31.513
Don't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child.

00:03:31.513 --> 00:03:33.838
You want someone who has the time and proximity

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:36.429
to do this job well, and you want someone

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.668
who can work with people under the pressure

00:03:38.668 --> 00:03:41.029
of an ever-changing situation.

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.723
Hospital readiness is critical.

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:44.627
You are likely to be headed to the emergency room,

00:03:44.627 --> 00:03:46.406
and you want to get this right.

00:03:46.406 --> 00:03:49.269
Prepare a one-page summary of your medical history,

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.557
medications and physician information.

00:03:51.557 --> 00:03:53.831
Put this in a really bright envelope

00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:56.667
with copies of your insurance cards, your power of attorney,

00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:59.067
and your do-not-resuscitate order.

00:03:59.067 --> 00:04:00.689
Have advocates keep a set in their car.

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.576
Tape a set to your refrigerator.

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.811
When you show up in the E.R. with this packet,

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:08.534
your admission is streamlined in a material way.

00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:11.139
You're going to need caregivers.

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.769
You'll need to assess your personality and financial situation

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.793
to determine whether an elder care community

00:04:17.793 --> 00:04:20.192
or staying at home is your best choice.

00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:22.899
In either case, do not settle.

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:26.265
We went through a number of not-quite-right caregivers

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:28.865
before we found the perfect team

00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:31.104
led by Marsha,

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:37.826
who won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:40.402
but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you

00:04:40.402 --> 00:04:42.828
when you can't get out there,

00:04:42.828 --> 00:04:45.555
and Caitlin, who won't let you skip your morning exercises

00:04:45.555 --> 00:04:47.161
but knows when you need to hear

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:50.753
that your wife is in good hands.

00:04:50.753 --> 00:04:53.380
Finally, last words.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.731
What do you want to hear at the very end,

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.339
and from whom would you like to hear it?

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.666
In my experience, you'll want to hear

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:03.668
that whatever you're worried about is going to be fine.

00:05:03.668 --> 00:05:07.620
When you believe it's okay to let go, you will.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.490
So, this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.596
What I've learned

00:05:15.596 --> 00:05:18.531
is if we put some time into planning our end of life,

00:05:18.531 --> 00:05:21.945
we have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life.

00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:24.525
Here are Jim and Shirley just after deciding

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.997
who would take care of their ranch.

00:05:26.997 --> 00:05:30.357
Here's Jim just a few weeks before he died,

00:05:30.357 --> 00:05:33.731
celebrating a birthday he didn't expect to see.

00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:37.749
And here's Shirley just a few days before she died

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:39.760
being read an article in that day's paper

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.085
about the significance of the wildlife refuge

00:05:42.085 --> 00:05:44.341
at the Modini ranch.

00:05:44.341 --> 00:05:47.094
Jim and Shirley had a good end of life,

00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:49.527
and by sharing their story with you,

00:05:49.527 --> 00:05:52.382
I hope to increase our chances of doing the same.

00:05:52.382 --> 00:05:53.669
Thank you.

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.748
(Applause)
