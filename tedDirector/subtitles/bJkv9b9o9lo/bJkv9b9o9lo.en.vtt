00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.860
Here's a question for you:

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.396
how many different scents
do you think you can smell,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.340
and maybe even identify with accuracy?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.820
100?

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.860
300?

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.100
1,000?

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.076
One study estimates that humans can
detect up to one trillion different odors.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.716
A trillion.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.556
It's hard to imagine,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.460
but your nose has the molecular
machinery to make it happen.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.556
Olfactory receptors --

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.516
tiny scent detectors --

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.476
are packed into your nose,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.916
each one patiently waiting
to be activated by the odor,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.236
or ligand,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.100
that it's been assigned to detect.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.436
It turns out we humans,
like all vertebrates,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.060
have lots of olfactory receptors.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.356
In fact, more of our DNA is devoted
to genes for different olfactory receptors

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.700
than for any other type of protein.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.339
Why is that?

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.756
Could olfactory receptors
be doing something else

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.980
in addition to allowing us to smell?

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.716
In 1991, Linda Buck and Richard Axel
uncovered the molecular identity

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.236
of olfactory receptors --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.420
work which ultimately
led to a Nobel Prize.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.596
At the time,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.420
we all assumed that these receptors
were only found in the nose.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.516
However, about a year or so later,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.036
a report emerged of an olfactory
receptor expressed in a tissue

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.156
other than the nose.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.836
And then another such report emerged,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.060
and another.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.756
We now know that these receptors
are found all over the body,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.140
including in some pretty
unexpected places --

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.356
in muscle,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.956
in kidneys,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.516
lungs

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.316
and blood vessels.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.500
But what are they doing there?

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.275
Well, we know that olfactory receptors
act as sensitive chemical sensors

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.516
in the nose --

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.580
that's how they mediate
our sense of smell.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.476
It turns out they also act
as sensitive chemical sensors

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.180
in many other parts of the body.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.996
Now, I'm not saying that your liver can
detect the aroma of your morning coffee

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.401
as you walk into the kitchen.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.436
Rather, after you drink
your morning coffee,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.436
your liver might use an olfactory receptor

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.636
to chemically detect
the change in concentration

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.899
of a chemical floating
through your bloodstream.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.316
Many cell types and tissues in the body
use chemical sensors,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.836
or chemosensors,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.836
to keep track of the concentration
of hormones, metabolites

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.316
and other molecules,

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.140
and some of these chemosensors
are olfactory receptors.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.996
If you are a pancreas or a kidney

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.836
and you need a specialized chemical sensor

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.436
that will allow you to keep track
of a specific molecule,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.060
why reinvent the wheel?

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.196
One of the first examples

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.156
of an olfactory receptor
found outside the nose

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.460
showed that human sperm
express an olfactory receptor,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.516
and that sperm with this receptor
will seek out the chemical

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.476
that the receptor responds to --

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.156
the receptor's ligand.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.580
That is, the sperm
will swim toward the ligand.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.540
This has intriguing implications.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.276
Are sperm aided in finding the egg

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.940
by sniffing out the area
with the highest ligand concentration?

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.756
I like this example
because it clearly demonstrates

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.076
that an olfactory receptor's primary job
is to be a chemical sensor,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.996
but depending on the context,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.716
it can influence how you perceive a smell,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.340
or in which direction sperm will swim,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.716
and as it turns out,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.060
a huge variety of other processes.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.756
Olfactory receptors have been
implicated in muscle cell migration,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.796
in helping the lung to sense
and respond to inhaled chemicals,

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.380
and in wound healing.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.836
Similarly, taste receptors once thought
to be found only in the tongue,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.860
are now known to be expressed
in cells and tissues throughout the body.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.156
Even more surprisingly,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.676
a recent study found

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.260
that the light receptors in our eyes
also play a role in our blood vessels.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.876
In my lab,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.356
we work on trying to understand the roles
of olfactory receptors and taste receptors

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.660
in the context of the kidney.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.676
The kidney is a central
control center for homeostasis.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.916
And to us,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.716
it makes sense that a homeostatic
control center would be a logical place

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.780
to employ chemical sensors.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.996
We've identified a number
of different olfactory and taste receptors

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.356
in the kidney,

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.956
one of which, olfactory receptor 78,

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.356
is known to be expressed
in cells and tissues

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.380
that are important
in the regulation of blood pressure.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.356
When this receptor is deleted in mice,

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.460
their blood pressure is low.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.716
Surprisingly, this receptor
was found to respond

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.956
to chemicals called
short-chain fatty acids

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.796
that are produced by the bacteria
that reside in your gut --

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.340
your gut microbiota.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.356
After being produced
by your gut microbiota,

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.196
these chemicals are absorbed
into your bloodstream

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.316
where they can then
interact with receptors

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.356
like olfactory receptor 78,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.236
meaning that the changes
in metabolism of your gut microbiota

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.820
may influence your blood pressure.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.956
Although we've identified a number
of different olfactory and taste receptors

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.236
in the kidney,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.396
we've only just begun
to tease out their different functions

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.860
and to figure out which chemicals
each of them responds to.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.996
Similar investigations lie ahead
for many other organs and tissues --

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.780
only a small minority of receptors
has been studied to date.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.980
This is exciting stuff.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.436
It's revolutionizing our understanding
of the scope of influence

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.380
for one of the five senses.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.076
And it has the potential
to change our understanding

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.740
of some aspects of human physiology.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.596
It's still early,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.876
but I think we've picked up on the scent
of something we're following.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.916
(Laughter)

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.156
Thank you.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.620
(Applause)
