00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Ladies and gentlemen, gather around.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I would love to share with you a story.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Once upon a time

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
in 19th century Germany,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
there was the book.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Now during this time,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
the book was the king of storytelling.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
It was venerable.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
It was ubiquitous.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.260
But it was a little bit boring.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Because in its 400 years of existence,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
storytellers never evolved the book

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
as a storytelling device.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
But then one author arrived,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.260
and he changed the game forever.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
(Music)

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
His name was Lothar,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Lothar Meggendorfer.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and he said, "Genug ist genug!"

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
He grabbed his pen,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
he snatched his scissors.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and just decided to fold.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
as -- who else? --

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
the world's first true inventor

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
of the children's pop-up book.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
(Music)

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
For this delight and for this wonder,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
people rejoiced.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
(Cheering)

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
They were happy because the story survived,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
and that the world would keep on spinning.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
to evolve the way a story was told,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
and he certainly wasn't the last.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Whether storytellers realized it or not,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.260
when they moved opera to vaudville,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
radio news to radio theater,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
film to film in motion

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
to film in sound, color, 3D,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
on VHS and on DVD.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
(Laughter)

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
but they could do so

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
For example, one company

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
would tell a story of love

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
through its very own search engine.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
One Taiwanese production studio

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
would interpret American politics in 3D.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.260
(Laughter)

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.260
And one man would tell the stories of his father

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
by using a platform called Twitter

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And after all this, everyone paused;

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
they took a step back.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.260
they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.260
to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And this was a cause for celebration.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
And for the most part, the stories are recycled.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
But the way that humans tell the stories

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
has always evolved

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
with pure, consistent novelty.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
And they remembered a man,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
one amazing German,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.260
every time a new storytelling device

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
popped up next.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And for that,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
the audience --

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
the lovely, beautiful audience --

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
would live happily ever after.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.260
(Applause)
