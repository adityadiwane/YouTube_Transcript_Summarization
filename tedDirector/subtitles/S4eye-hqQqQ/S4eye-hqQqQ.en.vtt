00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
Let's just start by looking at some great photographs.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
This is an icon of National Geographic,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
with a parody of National Geographic,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.330
and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
Oh, the wrath of Photoshop.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
This is a jet landing at San Francisco, by Bruce Dale.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
He mounted a camera on the tail.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy, by Sam Abell.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
Pygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
I love this photograph because it reminds me

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.330
A polar bear swimming in the Arctic, by Paul Nicklen.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth --

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
they're not very good swimmers --

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
and we know what's happening to the ice.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.330
These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
photographed by Chris Johns.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.330
Shot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
This is a rancher in Texas, by William Albert Allard,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
a great portraitist.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
And Jane Goodall, making her own special connection,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
photographed by Nick Nichols.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.330
This is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
And David said that there was lot of weird stuff

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
happening on the dance floor.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
But, hey, at least it's hygienic.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.330
(Laughter)

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.330
These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
by David Doubilet.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.330
And this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.330
And finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
photographed by Emory Kristof.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
Photography carries a power that holds up

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.330
under the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
because photographs emulate the way

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
that our mind freezes a significant moment.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
Here's an example.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
Four years ago, I was at the beach with my son,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
and he was learning how to swim

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
But I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.330
and started to be pulled out towards the jetty.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
I can stand here right now and see,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
as I go tearing into the water after him,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.330
I can see the rocks are over here.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
There's a wave about to crash onto him.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
I can see his hands reaching out,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
and I can see his face in terror,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
looking at me, saying, "Help me, Dad."

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
I got him. The wave broke over us.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
We got back on shore; he was fine.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
We were a little bit rattled.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.330
But this flashbulb memory, as it's called,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
is when all the elements came together to define

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.330
not just the event, but my emotional connection to it.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
And this is what a photograph taps into

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
Now I have to tell you,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
I was talking to Kyle last week about this,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
that I was going to tell this story.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
And he said, "Oh, yeah, I remember that too!

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
I remember my image of you

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
was that you were up on the shore yelling at me."

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
(Laughter)

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
I thought I was a hero.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.330
(Laughter)

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
So,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
this represents -- this is a cross-sample of

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.330
some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
working at the very top of their craft --

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
except one.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.330
This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
in New Zealand last year,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
and it was submitted and published in National Geographic.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
Last year, we added a section to our website called "Your Shot,"

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.330
where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.330
And it has become a wild success,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.330
tapping into the enthusiast photography community.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
The quality of these amateur photographs

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
can, at times, be amazing.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
And seeing this reinforces, for me,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
that every one of us has at least one or two

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
great photographs in them.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
But to be a great photojournalist,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
you have to have more than just one or two

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
great photographs in you.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
You've got to be able to make them all the time.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
But even more importantly,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
you need to know how to create a visual narrative.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
You need to know how to tell a story.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
So I'm going to share with you some coverages

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
Photographer Nick Nichols went to document

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
in Chad, called Zakouma.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
The original intent was to travel there

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
and bring back a classic story of diverse species,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
of an exotic locale.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
And that is what Nick did, up to a point.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
This is a serval cat.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
He's actually taking his own picture,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
shot with what's called a camera trap.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
There's an infrared beam that's going across,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.330
These are baboons at a watering hole.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
Nick -- the camera, again, an automatic camera

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
took thousands of pictures of this.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
of the rear ends of baboons.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.330
(Laughter)

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
A lion having a late night snack --

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
notice he's got a broken tooth.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
I love this little bit of water

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
that comes off the back of his tail.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.330
It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
Here's a photograph shot in moonlight,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
something that digital photography has made a big difference for.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
It was with the elephants that this story pivoted.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.330
Nick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
collared the matriarch of the herd.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
They named her Annie,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
and they began tracking her movements.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
The herd was safe within the confines of the park,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
because of this dedicated group of park rangers.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.330
But once the annual rains began,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
And that's when they ran into trouble.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
For outside the safety of the park were poachers,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.330
who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
The matriarch that they were radio tracking,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
after weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
came to a halt outside the park.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.330
Annie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
And they only came for the ivory.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
This is actually one of the rangers.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
because they couldn't leave it there,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
because it's still valuable.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
But what Nick did was he brought back

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.330
a story that went beyond the old-school method

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.330
of just straight, "Isn't this an amazing world?"

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.330
And instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
Instead of just knowledge of this park,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
he created an understanding and an empathy

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
for the elephants, the rangers and the many issues

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
surrounding human-wildlife conflicts.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
Now let's go over to India.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.330
touches upon in his new world population project.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
For the first time in history,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.330
more people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
And most of that growth is not in the cities,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
but in the slums that surround them.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
Jonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer,

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
came to me and said,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
"We need to document this, and here's my proposal.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.330
Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world."

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
And I said, "Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget."

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
So instead, what we did was

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
we decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
in what we'd consider sort of a survey story --

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything --

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
we put Jonas into Dharavi,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
which is part of Mumbai, India,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
and let him stay there, and really get into

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:43.330
the heart and soul of this really major part of the city.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
at the awful conditions that exist in such places.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
of how the entire urban area functioned.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
By staying tightly focused in one place,

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
that underlies this community.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
And he did it in a beautiful way.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
Sometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.330
We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
and photojournalist Randy Olson

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
to document the depletion of the world's fisheries.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.330
but the photographs that Brian and Randy created

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
are among the best to capture both the human

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
and natural devastation of overfishing.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
Here, in a photo by Brian,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.330
a seemingly crucified shark is caught up

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.330
in a gill net off of Baja.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
the animals accidentally scooped up

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
while fishing for a specific species.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
But here, Brian captured a unique view

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.330
by positioning himself underneath the boat

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.330
when they threw the waste overboard.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.330
And Brian then went on to even greater risk

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.330
to get this never-before-made photograph

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
Back on land, Randy Olson photographed

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.330
a makeshift fish market in Africa,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.330
where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
the main parts having already been sent to Europe.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.330
And here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
As prime food sources are depleted,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
the harvest goes deeper into the oceans

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
and brings in more such sources of protein.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.330
This is called fishing down the food chain.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
But there are also glimmers of hope,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330
and I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this,

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
we don't really want to go

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
and just look at all the problems.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.330
We also want to look for solutions.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.330
Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
where commercial fishing had been banned --

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.330
the result being that the overfished species have been restored,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.330
and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
Photography can also compel us to confront

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
issues that are potentially distressing and controversial.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.330
James Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
took a look at the sweep of the medical system

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.330
and exits back home, on the other.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
Jim started in the battlefield.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.330
Here, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
Here is in the field hospital.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
tattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.330
From here, the more severely wounded are transported

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.330
back to Germany, where they meet up with their families

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
for the first time.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.330
And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
such as here in Walter Reed.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
And finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis,

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
they exit the medical system and attempt

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
to regain their pre-war lives.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.330
Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.330
and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
Now, these stories are great examples

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
of how photography can be used

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
to address some of our most important topics.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
But there are also times when photographers

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.330
simply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it,

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
just plain fun.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
to shoot a story on leopard seals.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.330
They have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.330
In fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.330
grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.330
So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.330
about getting into the water.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
Now, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
You know of "The March of the Penguins."

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
This is sort of the munch of the penguins.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
(Laughter)

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.330
Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.330
to see if the coast is clear.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.330
And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
But then Paul got in the water.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.330
And he said he was never really afraid of this.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.330
Well, this one female came up to him.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330
She's probably -- it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
but she's 12 feet long.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
So, she is pretty significant in size.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.330
And Paul said he was never really afraid,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.330
because she was more curious about him than threatened.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
This mouthing behavior, on the right,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.330
was really her way of saying to him, "Hey, look how big I am!"

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
Or you know, "My, what big teeth you have."

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.330
(Laughter)

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.330
To her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
that for some reason didn't seem to be interested

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
in chasing penguins.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.330
So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him,

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
alive, and put them in front of him.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.330
She dropped them off, and then they would swim away.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
She'd kind of look at him, like "What are you doing?"

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
Go back and get them, and then bring them back

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
and drop them in front of him.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.330
And she did this over the course of a couple of days,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
until the point where she got so frustrated with him

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
that she started putting them directly on top of his head.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
(Laughter)

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.330
Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.330
(Laughter)

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.330
Eventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
that he was never going to survive.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
This is her just puffing out, you know,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
snorting out in disgust.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
(Laughter)

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.330
And lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
Paul set out to photograph a relatively

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
mysterious and unknown creature,

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
and came back with not just a collection of photographs,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
but an amazing experience and a great story.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.330
It is these kinds of stories,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
that demonstrate the power of photojournalism.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:42.330
I believe that photography can make a real connection to people,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
and can be employed as a positive agent

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.330
for understanding the challenges and opportunities

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
facing our world today.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.330
Thank you.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:54.330
(Applause)
