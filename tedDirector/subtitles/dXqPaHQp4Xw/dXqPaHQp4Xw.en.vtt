00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Hi, my name is Roz Savage

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and I row across oceans.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Four years ago, I rowed solo across the Atlantic,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and since then, I've done two out of three stages

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
across the Pacific,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
from San Francisco to Hawaii

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and from Hawaii to Kiribati.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And tomorrow, I'll be leaving this boat

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
to fly back to Kiribati

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
to continue with the third and final stage

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
of my row across the Pacific.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Cumulatively, I will have rowed

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
over 8,000 miles,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
taken over three million oar strokes

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
and spent more than 312 days alone

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
This has given me a very

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
special relationship with the ocean.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
We have a bit of a love/hate thing going on.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
I feel a bit about it like I did about

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
a very strict math teacher that I once had at school.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
I didn't always like her, but I did respect her,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and she taught me a heck of a lot.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
So today I'd like to share with you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
some of my ocean adventures

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and apply them to this environmental challenge

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
that we face right now.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Now, some of you might be thinking,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
"Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
Isn't she meant to be about this tall

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and about this wide

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
and maybe look a bit more like these guys?"

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
You'll notice, they've all got something that I don't.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Well, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards. (Laughter)

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and I hope that it remains that way.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
For a long time, I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
The story that I told myself was

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that adventurers looked like this.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
I didn't look the part.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
I thought there were them and there were us,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and I was not one of them.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
So for 11 years, I conformed.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
I was working in an office in London

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
as a management consultant.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
But that kind of conditioning

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
just kept me there for so many years,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
until I reached my mid-30s and I thought,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
"You know, I'm not getting any younger.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
I feel like I've got a purpose in this life, and I don't know what it is,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
but I'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
So, fast forward a few years.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I'd gone through some changes.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
To try and answer that question of,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
"What am I supposed to be doing with my life?"

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
I sat down one day

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and wrote two versions of my own obituary,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
the one that I wanted, a life of adventure,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and the one that I was actually heading for

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
which was a nice, normal, pleasant life,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and thinking, "Oh boy,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
I'm on totally the wrong track here.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
If I carry on living as I am now,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
I'm just not going to end up where I want to be

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
in five years, or 10 years,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
or at the end of my life."

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
I made a few changes,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
let go of some loose trappings of my old life,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and through a bit of a leap of logic,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
(Laughter)

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
it's about 3,000 miles,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
and it turned out to be

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
the hardest thing I had ever done.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Sure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
getting out of your comfort zone is, by definition,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
extremely uncomfortable.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
And my timing was not great either:

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
2005, when I did the Atlantic,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
was the year of Hurricane Katrina.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
than ever before, since records began.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And pretty early on,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
those storms started making their presence known.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
All four of my oars broke

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
before I reached halfway across.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Oars are not supposed to look like this.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
But what can you do? You're in the middle of the ocean.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Oars are your only means of propulsion.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
So I just had to look around the boat

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
and figure out what I was going to use

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
to fix up these oars so that I could carry on.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and splintered the boat hook

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
to the oars to reinforce it.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
Then, when that gave out,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and used those.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
And then when those gave out, I cannibalized one of the broken oars.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
I'd never been very good at fixing stuff

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
when I was living my old life,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
but it's amazing how resourceful you can become

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
when you're in the middle of the ocean

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
and there's only one way to get to the other side.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And the oars kind of became a symbol

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
of just in how many ways

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
I went beyond what I thought were my limits.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
I suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and saltwater sores on my bottom.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
I really struggled psychologically,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
realizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
3,000 miles was going to

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
take me a very, very long time.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
There were so many times

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
when I thought I'd hit that limit,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
but had no choice but to just carry on

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
without driving myself crazy.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And eventually after

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
103 days at sea,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
I arrived in Antigua.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
I don't think I've ever felt so happy

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
in my entire life.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
It was a bit like finishing a marathon

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
and getting out of solitary confinement

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
and winning an Oscar all rolled into one.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
I was euphoric.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And to see all the people coming out to greet me

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
I just felt like a movie star.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
It was absolutely wonderful.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
And I really learned then that, the bigger the challenge,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
the bigger the sense of achievement

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
when you get to the end of it.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
So this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
that might be going through your mind.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Number one that I get asked: What do you eat?

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
A few freeze-dried meals, but mostly I try and eat

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
much more unprocessed foods.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
So I grow my own beansprouts.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
I eat fruits and nut bars,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
a lot of nuts.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
at the other end.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
Question number two: How do you sleep?

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
With my eyes shut. Ha-ha.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
I suppose what you mean is:

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping?

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Well, I plan my route so that I'm drifting

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
in the right direction.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Worst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
That's a bad day at the office.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
What do I wear?

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Mostly, a baseball cap,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
depending on whether I went backwards overnight --

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and lots of sun lotion.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Do I have a chase boat?

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
No I don't. I'm totally self-supporting out there.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
I don't see anybody for the whole time

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
that I'm at sea, generally.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And finally: Am I crazy?

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
Well, I leave that one up to you to judge.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
So, how do you top rowing across the Atlantic?

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Well, naturally, you decide to row across the Pacific.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Well, I thought the Atlantic was big,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
but the Pacific is really, really big.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
I don't know for sure that the Brits

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
invented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so:

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
we are right in the middle,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and we've cut the Pacific in half

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
and flung it to the far corners of the world.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
Whereas if you look in Google Earth,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
this is how the Pacific looks.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
It pretty much covers half the planet.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
You can just see a little bit of North America up here

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and a sliver of Australia down there.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
It is really big --

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
65 million square miles --

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
and to row in a straight line across it

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
would be about 8,000 miles.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
Unfortunately, ocean rowboats

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
very rarely go in a straight line.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
By the time I get to Australia,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
if I get to Australia,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
So, because nobody in their straight mind would row

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
straight past Hawaii without dropping in,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
I decided to cut this very big undertaking

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
into three segments.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
The first attempt didn't go so well.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
In 2007, I did a rather involuntary capsize drill

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
three times in 24 hours.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
A bit like being in a washing machine.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Boat got a bit dinged up,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
so did I.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
I blogged about it. Unfortunately, somebody

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
with a bit of a hero complex decided that

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
this damsel was in distress and needed saving.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
I tried to tell them to go away.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
We had a bit of a battle of wills.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
I lost and got airlifted.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Awful, really awful.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
It was one of the worst feelings of my life,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
and looked down at my trusty little boat

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
rolling around in the 20 foot waves

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
and wondering if I would ever see her again.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
So I had to launch a very expensive

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
salvage operation

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and then wait another nine months

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
before I could get back out onto the ocean again.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
But what do you do?

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
Fall down nine times, get up 10.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
So, the following year, I set out

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
and, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
But it was not without misadventure.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
My watermaker broke,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Powered by my solar panels,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
it sucks in saltwater

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
and turns it into freshwater.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
which is what happened to it.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
Fortunately, help was at hand.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
There was another unusual boat out there

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
at the same time, doing as I was doing,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
with an estimated 3.5 million

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
tons of trash in it,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
circulating at the center of

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
that North Pacific Gyre.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
So, to make the point, these guys

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
had actually built their boat out of plastic trash,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
15,000 empty water bottles

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
latched together into two pontoons.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
They were going very slowly.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
Partly, they'd had a bit of a delay.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
They'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
and they were starting to sink.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
But, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
luckily, our courses were converging.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
They were running out of food; I was running out of water.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
And it took about a week

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
for us to actually gradually converge.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
I was doing a pathetically slow speed

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
of about 1.3 knots,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4:

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
it was like two snails in a mating dance.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
But, eventually, we did manage to meet up

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
and Joel hopped overboard,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
caught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
which was the best food I'd had

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
in, ooh, at least three months.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
Fortunately, the one that he caught that day

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
When they opened this one up,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
they found its stomach was full of plastic.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And this is really bad news because plastic

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
is not an inert substance.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
It leaches out chemicals

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
and then we come along and eat that poor critter,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
and we get some of the toxins accumulating

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
in our bodies as well.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
So there are very real implications for human health.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
And, the following year, set out

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
on the second stage of the Pacific,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
from Hawaii down to Tarawa.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
And you'll notice something about Tarawa;

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
it is very low-lying.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
It's that little green sliver on the horizon,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
which makes them very nervous

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
about rising oceans.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
This is big trouble for these guys.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
They've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
And also, as an increase in extreme

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
weather events due to climate change,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
they're expecting more waves

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
to come in over the fringing reef,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
which will contaminate their fresh water supply.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
I had a meeting with the president there,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
who told me about his

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
exit strategy for his country.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
He expects that within the next 50 years,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
the 100,000 people that live there

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
will have to relocate to

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
New Zealand or Australia.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
And that made me think about how would I feel

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
if Britain was going to disappear under the waves;

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
if the places where I'd been born

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
and gone to school

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
and got married,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
if all those places were just going to disappear forever.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
How, literally, ungrounded

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
that would make me feel.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
Very shortly, I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
and if I'm successful, I'll be the first woman ever to row solo

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
all the way across the Pacific.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
to bring a human face to the ocean.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
If the Atlantic was about my inner journey,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
discovering my own capabilities,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
figuring out how I can use

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
my interesting career choice

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
to be of service to the world,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
and to take some of those things that I've learned out there

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
and apply them to the situation

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
that humankind now finds itself in.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
I think there are probably three key points here.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
The first one is about

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
the stories that we tell ourselves.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
For so long, I told myself

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
that I couldn't have an adventure

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
because I wasn't six foot tall

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
and athletic and bearded.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
And then that story changed.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
I found out that people had rowed across oceans.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
I even met one of them and she was just about my size.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
So even though I didn't grow any taller,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
I didn't sprout a beard,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
something had changed: My interior dialogue had changed.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
At the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselves

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
is that we need all this stuff,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
that we need oil.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
But what about if we just change that story?

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
We do have alternatives,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
and we have the power of free will

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
to choose those alternatives, those sustainable ones,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
to create a greener future.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
The second point is about

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
the accumulation of tiny actions.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
We might think that anything that we do as an individual

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
is just a drop in the ocean, that it can't really make a difference.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
But it does. Generally, we haven't

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
got ourselves into this mess through big disasters.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
Yes, there have been the Exxon Valdezes

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
and the Chernobyls,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
but mostly it's been an accumulation

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
of bad decisions

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
by billions of individuals,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
day after day and year after year.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
And, by the same token, we can turn that tide.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
We can start making better,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
wiser, more sustainable decisions.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
And when we do that, we're not just one person.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
Anything that we do spreads ripples.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
and you pull out your

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
reusable grocery bag.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
Maybe if we all start doing this,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
we can make it socially unacceptable

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
to say yes to plastic in the checkout line.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
That's just one example.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
This is a world-wide community.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
The other point:

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
It's about taking responsibility.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
For so much of my life,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
I wanted something else to make me happy.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
I thought if I had the right house or the right car

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
or the right man in my life,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
then I could be happy.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
But when I wrote that obituary exercise,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
I actually grew up a little bit in that moment

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
and realized that I needed to create my own future.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
I couldn't just wait passively

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
for happiness to come and find me.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
I plan on being around for a long time,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
and when I'm 90 years old,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
I want to be happy and healthy.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
And it's very difficult to be happy

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
on a planet that's racked

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
with famine and drought.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
where we've poisoned the earth

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
and the sea and the air.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
So, shortly, I'm going to be

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
launching a new initiative

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
called Eco-Heroes.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
And the idea here is that

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
It's meant to be a bit of a game.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
We're going to make an iPhone app out of it.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
We just want to try and create that awareness

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
because, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world,

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
but that attitude,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
or take your reusable coffee mug,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
that is what could change the world.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
I really believe that we stand

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
at a very important point in history.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
We have a choice. We've been blessed,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
or cursed, with free will.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
We can choose a greener future,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
and we can get there

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
Thank you.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
(Applause)
