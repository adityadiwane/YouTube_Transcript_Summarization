00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.641
So, I have a strange career.

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:20.781
I know it because people come up to me,
like colleagues, and say,

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:22.671
"Chris, you have a strange career."

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:24.338
(Laughter)

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:25.681
And I can see their point,

00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:30.236
because I started my career
as a theoretical nuclear physicist.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.424
And I was thinking about quarks
and gluons and heavy ion collisions,

00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:36.236
and I was only 14 years old --

00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:39.540
No, no, I wasn't 14 years old.

00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:42.236
But after that,

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:44.997
I actually had my own lab

00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:47.136
in the Computational
Neuroscience department,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.888
and I wasn't doing any neuroscience.

00:00:48.912 --> 00:00:51.844
Later, I would work
on evolutionary genetics,

00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:53.818
and I would work on systems biology.

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:56.507
But I'm going to tell you
about something else today.

00:00:56.531 --> 00:01:00.793
I'm going to tell you
about how I learned something about life.

00:01:00.817 --> 00:01:04.298
And I was actually a rocket scientist.

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:06.625
I wasn't really a rocket scientist,

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.005
but I was working
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:13.664
in sunny California, where it's warm;

00:01:13.688 --> 00:01:17.536
whereas now I am
in the mid-West, and it's cold.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.236
But it was an exciting experience.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.703
One day, a NASA manager
comes into my office,

00:01:23.727 --> 00:01:26.236
sits down and says,

00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:30.663
"Can you please tell us,
how do we look for life outside Earth?"

00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:33.299
And that came as a surprise to me,

00:01:33.323 --> 00:01:36.957
because I was actually hired
to work on quantum computation.

00:01:37.473 --> 00:01:38.974
Yet, I had a very good answer.

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.424
I said, "I have no idea."

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.949
(Laughter)

00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:47.315
And he told me, "Biosignatures,
we need to look for a biosignature."

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:48.703
And I said, "What is that?"

00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:51.324
And he said, "It's any
measurable phenomenon

00:01:51.348 --> 00:01:54.193
that allows us to indicate
the presence of life."

00:01:54.788 --> 00:01:55.938
And I said, "Really?

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:58.380
Because isn't that easy?

00:01:58.404 --> 00:02:00.235
I mean, we have life.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.231
Can't you apply a definition,

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:06.429
for example, a Supreme Court-like
definition of life?"

00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:09.733
And then I thought about it
a little bit, and I said,

00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:11.232
"Well, is it really that easy?

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:13.449
Because, yes, if you see
something like this,

00:02:13.473 --> 00:02:15.817
then all right, fine,
I'm going to call it life --

00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:16.991
no doubt about it.

00:02:17.517 --> 00:02:19.157
But here's something."

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:22.236
And he goes, "Right,
that's life too. I know that."

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.852
Except, if you think that life
is also defined by things that die,

00:02:26.876 --> 00:02:28.629
you're not in luck with this thing,

00:02:28.653 --> 00:02:30.915
because that's actually
a very strange organism.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.986
It grows up into the adult stage like that

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.236
and then goes through
a Benjamin Button phase,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.195
and actually goes backwards and backwards
until it's like a little embryo again,

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.133
and then actually grows back up,
and back down and back up --

00:02:43.157 --> 00:02:44.936
sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.186
So it's actually life,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.235
but it's actually not
as we thought life would be.

00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:53.662
And then you see something like that.

00:02:53.686 --> 00:02:56.559
And he was like, "My God,
what kind of a life form is that?"

00:02:56.583 --> 00:02:58.002
Anyone know?

00:02:58.026 --> 00:03:01.028
It's actually not life, it's a crystal.

00:03:01.542 --> 00:03:04.843
So once you start looking and looking
at smaller and smaller things --

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:08.029
so this particular person wrote
a whole article and said,

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:09.534
"Hey, these are bacteria."

00:03:09.558 --> 00:03:11.529
Except, if you look a little bit closer,

00:03:11.553 --> 00:03:15.189
you see, in fact, that this thing
is way too small to be anything like that.

00:03:15.213 --> 00:03:18.371
So he was convinced,
but, in fact, most people aren't.

00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:22.236
And then, of course,
NASA also had a big announcement,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.125
and President Clinton
gave a press conference,

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:30.010
about this amazing discovery
of life in a Martian meteorite.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.621
Except that nowadays,
it's heavily disputed.

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:36.501
If you take the lesson
of all these pictures,

00:03:36.525 --> 00:03:39.419
then you realize, well, actually,
maybe it's not that easy.

00:03:39.443 --> 00:03:42.842
Maybe I do need a definition of life

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:45.144
in order to make that kind of distinction.

00:03:45.168 --> 00:03:47.699
So can life be defined?

00:03:47.723 --> 00:03:49.230
Well how would you go about it?

00:03:49.254 --> 00:03:53.261
Well of course, you'd go
to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L.

00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:56.297
No, of course you don't do that;
you put it somewhere in Google.

00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:57.912
And then you might get something.

00:03:57.936 --> 00:03:58.960
(Laughter)

00:03:58.984 --> 00:04:00.202
And what you might get --

00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:04.005
and anything that actually refers
to things that we are used to,

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:05.251
you throw away.

00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:07.773
And then you might come up
with something like this.

00:04:07.797 --> 00:04:11.054
And it says something complicated
with lots and lots of concepts.

00:04:11.078 --> 00:04:16.438
Who on Earth would write something
as convoluted and complex and inane?

00:04:18.212 --> 00:04:22.113
Oh, it's actually a really, really,
important set of concepts.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.236
So I'm highlighting just a few words

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.184
and saying definitions
like that rely on things

00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:34.357
that are not based on amino acids
or leaves or anything that we are used to,

00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:36.132
but in fact on processes only.

00:04:36.156 --> 00:04:38.027
And if you take a look at that,

00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:41.508
this was actually in a book that I wrote
that deals with artificial life.

00:04:41.532 --> 00:04:45.759
And that explains why that NASA manager
was actually in my office to begin with.

00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:48.870
Because the idea was that,
with concepts like that,

00:04:48.894 --> 00:04:52.914
maybe we can actually
manufacture a form of life.

00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:57.735
And so if you go and ask yourself,
"What on Earth is artificial life?",

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.428
let me give you a whirlwind tour
of how all this stuff came about.

00:05:01.452 --> 00:05:04.587
And it started out quite a while ago,

00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:08.936
when someone wrote one of the first
successful computer viruses.

00:05:09.245 --> 00:05:11.418
And for those of you
who aren't old enough,

00:05:11.442 --> 00:05:14.025
you have no idea
how this infection was working --

00:05:14.049 --> 00:05:16.309
namely, through these floppy disks.

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:20.220
But the interesting thing
about these computer virus infections

00:05:20.244 --> 00:05:23.696
was that, if you look at the rate
at which the infection worked,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.870
they show this spiky behavior
that you're used to from a flu virus.

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:30.236
And it is in fact due to this arms race

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.716
between hackers
and operating system designers

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.340
that things go back and forth.

00:05:35.364 --> 00:05:39.875
And the result is kind of
a tree of life of these viruses,

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:43.504
a phylogeny that looks very much
like the type of life

00:05:43.528 --> 00:05:45.957
that we're used to,
at least on the viral level.

00:05:45.981 --> 00:05:47.311
So is that life?

00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:49.142
Not as far as I'm concerned.

00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:52.008
Why? Because these things
don't evolve by themselves.

00:05:52.032 --> 00:05:53.985
In fact, they have hackers writing them.

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.339
But the idea was taken
very quickly a little bit further,

00:05:57.363 --> 00:06:00.674
when a scientist working
at the Santa Fe Institute decided,

00:06:00.698 --> 00:06:03.831
"Why don't we try to package
these little viruses

00:06:03.855 --> 00:06:06.070
in artificial worlds
inside of the computer

00:06:06.094 --> 00:06:07.365
and let them evolve?"

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:08.983
And this was Steen Rasmussen.

00:06:09.007 --> 00:06:11.699
And he designed this system,
but it really didn't work,

00:06:11.723 --> 00:06:14.607
because his viruses
were constantly destroying each other.

00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:18.148
But there was another scientist
who had been watching this, an ecologist.

00:06:18.172 --> 00:06:20.664
And he went home and says,
"I know how to fix this."

00:06:20.688 --> 00:06:22.332
And he wrote the Tierra system,

00:06:22.356 --> 00:06:23.561
and, in my book,

00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:27.409
is in fact one of the first
truly artificial living systems --

00:06:27.433 --> 00:06:30.895
except for the fact that these programs
didn't really grow in complexity.

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.783
So having seen this work,
worked a little bit on this,

00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:35.465
this is where I came in.

00:06:35.489 --> 00:06:39.132
And I decided to create a system
that has all the properties

00:06:39.156 --> 00:06:43.002
that are necessary to see, in fact,
the evolution of complexity,

00:06:43.026 --> 00:06:46.328
more and more complex
problems constantly evolving.

00:06:46.352 --> 00:06:50.136
And of course, since I really don't know
how to write code, I had help in this.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.708
I had two undergraduate students

00:06:51.732 --> 00:06:54.461
at California Institute of Technology
that worked with me.

00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:57.337
That's Charles Ofria on the left,
Titus Brown on the right.

00:06:57.361 --> 00:06:59.696
They are now, actually,
respectable professors

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.462
at Michigan State University,

00:07:01.486 --> 00:07:05.987
but I can assure you, back in the day,
we were not a respectable team.

00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:08.060
And I'm really happy
that no photo survives

00:07:08.084 --> 00:07:10.607
of the three of us
anywhere close together.

00:07:11.352 --> 00:07:13.227
But what is this system like?

00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:15.440
Well I can't really go into the details,

00:07:15.464 --> 00:07:18.117
but what you see here
is some of the entrails.

00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:22.226
But what I wanted to focus on
is this type of population structure.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.722
There's about 10,000
programs sitting here.

00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:27.665
And all different strains
are colored in different colors.

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:31.293
And as you see here, there are groups
that are growing on top of each other,

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:32.658
because they are spreading.

00:07:32.682 --> 00:07:36.786
Any time there is a program
that's better at surviving in this world,

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.778
due to whatever mutation it has acquired,

00:07:38.802 --> 00:07:42.272
it is going to spread over the others
and drive the others to extinction.

00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:43.851
So I'm going to show you a movie

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:46.102
where you're going to see
that kind of dynamic.

00:07:46.126 --> 00:07:50.402
And these kinds of experiments are started
with programs that we wrote ourselves.

00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:53.763
We write our own stuff, replicate it,
and are very proud of ourselves.

00:07:53.787 --> 00:07:56.563
And we put them in,
and what you see immediately

00:07:56.587 --> 00:07:59.653
is that there are waves
and waves of innovation.

00:07:59.677 --> 00:08:01.571
By the way, this is highly accelerated,

00:08:01.595 --> 00:08:03.792
so it's like a 1000 generations a second.

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:07.783
But immediately, the system goes like,
"What kind of dumb piece of code was this?

00:08:07.807 --> 00:08:11.528
This can be improved upon
in so many ways, so quickly."

00:08:11.552 --> 00:08:15.300
So you see waves of new types
taking over the other types.

00:08:15.324 --> 00:08:17.886
And this type of activity
goes on for quite a while,

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.731
until the main easy things
have been acquired by these programs.

00:08:22.755 --> 00:08:26.236
And then, you see
sort of like a stasis coming on

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.236
where the system essentially waits

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.443
for a new type of innovation,
like this one,

00:08:31.467 --> 00:08:35.749
which is going to spread over
all the other innovations that were before

00:08:35.773 --> 00:08:38.236
and is erasing the genes
that it had before,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.236
until a new type of higher level
of complexity has been achieved.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.236
And this process goes on and on and on.

00:08:45.727 --> 00:08:47.042
So what we see here

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:51.229
is a system that lives in very much
the way we're used to how life goes.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:56.068
But what the NASA people
had asked me really was,

00:08:56.473 --> 00:08:59.235
"Do these guys have a biosignature?

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.653
Can we measure this type of life?

00:09:01.677 --> 00:09:02.869
Because if we can,

00:09:02.893 --> 00:09:06.742
maybe we have a chance of actually
discovering life somewhere else

00:09:06.766 --> 00:09:09.920
without being biased
by things like amino acids."

00:09:10.481 --> 00:09:15.014
So I said, "Well, perhaps
we should construct a biosignature

00:09:15.038 --> 00:09:18.236
based on life as a universal process.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.124
In fact, it should perhaps make use
of the concepts that I developed

00:09:23.148 --> 00:09:27.235
just in order to sort of capture
what a simple living system might be."

00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:28.778
And the thing I came up with --

00:09:28.802 --> 00:09:32.784
I have to first give you
an introduction about the idea,

00:09:32.808 --> 00:09:36.347
and maybe that would be
a meaning detector,

00:09:36.371 --> 00:09:37.918
rather than a life detector.

00:09:38.486 --> 00:09:40.236
And the way we would do that --

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.896
I would like to find out
how I can distinguish text

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.567
that was written by a million monkeys,
as opposed to text that is in our books.

00:09:47.905 --> 00:09:49.782
And I would like to do it in such a way

00:09:49.806 --> 00:09:52.684
that I don't actually have to be able
to read the language,

00:09:52.708 --> 00:09:54.478
because I'm sure I won't be able to.

00:09:54.502 --> 00:09:57.002
As long as I know
that there's some sort of alphabet.

00:09:57.026 --> 00:09:59.356
So here would be a frequency plot

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.762
of how often you find
each of the 26 letters of the alphabet

00:10:02.786 --> 00:10:05.005
in a text written by random monkeys.

00:10:05.455 --> 00:10:10.009
And obviously, each of these letters
comes off about roughly equally frequent.

00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:13.625
But if you now look at the same
distribution in English texts,

00:10:13.649 --> 00:10:14.897
it looks like that.

00:10:15.462 --> 00:10:19.010
And I'm telling you,
this is very robust across English texts.

00:10:19.034 --> 00:10:22.018
And if I look at French texts,
it looks a little bit different,

00:10:22.042 --> 00:10:23.220
or Italian or German.

00:10:23.244 --> 00:10:26.660
They all have their own type
of frequency distribution,

00:10:26.684 --> 00:10:28.117
but it's robust.

00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:31.348
It doesn't matter whether it writes
about politics or about science.

00:10:31.372 --> 00:10:37.152
It doesn't matter whether it's a poem
or whether it's a mathematical text.

00:10:37.176 --> 00:10:39.013
It's a robust signature,

00:10:39.037 --> 00:10:40.857
and it's very stable.

00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:43.038
As long as our books
are written in English --

00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:45.853
because people are rewriting them
and recopying them --

00:10:45.877 --> 00:10:47.236
it's going to be there.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:53.021
So that inspired me to think about,
well, what if I try to use this idea

00:10:53.045 --> 00:10:56.800
in order, not to detect random texts
from texts with meaning,

00:10:56.824 --> 00:11:00.553
but rather detect the fact
that there is meaning

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:03.104
in the biomolecules that make up life.

00:11:03.128 --> 00:11:04.296
But first I have to ask:

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.808
what are these building blocks,

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.128
like the alphabet, elements
that I showed you?

00:11:08.152 --> 00:11:11.025
Well it turns out, we have
many different alternatives

00:11:11.049 --> 00:11:13.363
for such a set of building blocks.

00:11:13.387 --> 00:11:14.635
We could use amino acids,

00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:17.861
we could use nucleic acids,
carboxylic acids, fatty acids.

00:11:17.885 --> 00:11:21.323
In fact, chemistry's extremely rich,
and our body uses a lot of them.

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.653
So that we actually, to test this idea,

00:11:23.677 --> 00:11:27.224
first took a look at amino acids
and some other carboxylic acids.

00:11:27.248 --> 00:11:28.719
And here's the result.

00:11:28.743 --> 00:11:31.909
Here is, in fact, what you get

00:11:31.933 --> 00:11:34.956
if you, for example, look
at the distribution of amino acids

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.715
on a comet or in interstellar space
or, in fact, in a laboratory,

00:11:39.739 --> 00:11:42.398
where you made very sure
that in your primordial soup,

00:11:42.422 --> 00:11:44.340
there is no living stuff in there.

00:11:44.364 --> 00:11:47.243
What you find is mostly
glycine and then alanine

00:11:47.267 --> 00:11:49.626
and there's some trace elements
of the other ones.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.079
That is also very robust --

00:11:52.103 --> 00:11:55.935
what you find in systems like Earth

00:11:55.959 --> 00:11:59.104
where there are amino acids,
but there is no life.

00:11:59.128 --> 00:12:03.758
But suppose you take some dirt
and dig through it

00:12:03.782 --> 00:12:06.742
and then put it into these spectrometers,

00:12:06.766 --> 00:12:08.864
because there's bacteria
all over the place;

00:12:08.888 --> 00:12:11.119
or you take water anywhere on Earth,

00:12:11.143 --> 00:12:12.660
because it's teaming with life,

00:12:12.684 --> 00:12:14.434
and you make the same analysis;

00:12:14.458 --> 00:12:17.035
the spectrum looks completely different.

00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:20.434
Of course, there is still
glycine and alanine,

00:12:20.458 --> 00:12:23.778
but in fact, there are these heavy
elements, these heavy amino acids,

00:12:23.802 --> 00:12:27.197
that are being produced
because they are valuable to the organism.

00:12:28.327 --> 00:12:32.265
And some other ones
that are not used in the set of 20,

00:12:32.289 --> 00:12:35.187
they will not appear at all
in any type of concentration.

00:12:35.211 --> 00:12:37.916
So this also turns out
to be extremely robust.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.058
It doesn't matter what kind of sediment
you're using to grind up,

00:12:41.082 --> 00:12:44.361
whether it's bacteria
or any other plants or animals.

00:12:44.385 --> 00:12:45.809
Anywhere there's life,

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.784
you're going to have this distribution,

00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:49.625
as opposed to that distribution.

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:52.886
And it is detectable
not just in amino acids.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.127
Now you could ask:

00:12:54.151 --> 00:12:57.310
Well, what about these Avidians?

00:12:57.334 --> 00:13:00.385
The Avidians being the denizens
of this computer world

00:13:00.409 --> 00:13:03.854
where they are perfectly happy
replicating and growing in complexity.

00:13:03.878 --> 00:13:08.895
So this is the distribution that you get
if, in fact, there is no life.

00:13:08.919 --> 00:13:11.637
They have about 28 of these instructions.

00:13:11.661 --> 00:13:15.013
And if you have a system where
they're being replaced one by the other,

00:13:15.037 --> 00:13:17.222
it's like the monkeys
writing on a typewriter.

00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:21.466
Each of these instructions
appears with roughly the equal frequency.

00:13:22.375 --> 00:13:27.155
But if you now take
a set of replicating guys

00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:29.129
like in the video that you saw,

00:13:29.153 --> 00:13:30.672
it looks like this.

00:13:31.459 --> 00:13:32.932
So there are some instructions

00:13:32.956 --> 00:13:35.389
that are extremely valuable
to these organisms,

00:13:35.413 --> 00:13:37.383
and their frequency is going to be high.

00:13:37.407 --> 00:13:41.448
And there's actually some instructions
that you only use once, if ever.

00:13:41.472 --> 00:13:42.995
So they are either poisonous

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:47.524
or really should be used
at less of a level than random.

00:13:47.548 --> 00:13:50.236
In this case, the frequency is lower.

00:13:51.192 --> 00:13:53.863
And so now we can see,
is that really a robust signature?

00:13:53.887 --> 00:13:55.244
I can tell you indeed it is,

00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:58.516
because this type of spectrum,
just like what you've seen in books,

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.693
and just like what you've seen
in amino acids,

00:14:00.717 --> 00:14:03.359
it doesn't really matter
how you change the environment,

00:14:03.383 --> 00:14:06.007
it's very robust, it's going
to reflect the environment.

00:14:06.031 --> 00:14:08.980
So I'm going to show you now
a little experiment that we did.

00:14:09.004 --> 00:14:10.388
And I have to explain to you,

00:14:10.412 --> 00:14:11.594
the top of this graph

00:14:11.618 --> 00:14:14.362
shows you that frequency
distribution that I talked about.

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:18.193
Here, that's the lifeless environment

00:14:18.217 --> 00:14:21.629
where each instruction occurs
at an equal frequency.

00:14:22.564 --> 00:14:27.557
And below there, I show, in fact,
the mutation rate in the environment.

00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:30.884
And I'm starting this
at a mutation rate that is so high

00:14:30.908 --> 00:14:34.874
that even if you would drop
a replicating program

00:14:34.898 --> 00:14:39.023
that would otherwise happily grow up
to fill the entire world,

00:14:39.047 --> 00:14:42.057
if you drop it in, it gets mutated
to death immediately.

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:47.427
So there is no life possible
at that type of mutation rate.

00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:51.487
But then I'm going to slowly
turn down the heat, so to speak,

00:14:51.511 --> 00:14:53.696
and then there's this viability threshold

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.612
where now it would be possible
for a replicator to actually live.

00:14:57.636 --> 00:15:02.981
And indeed, we're going to be dropping
these guys into that soup all the time.

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:05.055
So let's see what that looks like.

00:15:05.079 --> 00:15:08.077
So first, nothing, nothing, nothing.

00:15:08.101 --> 00:15:09.916
Too hot, too hot.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.236
Now the viability threshold is reached,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.752
and the frequency distribution
has dramatically changed

00:15:16.776 --> 00:15:18.252
and, in fact, stabilizes.

00:15:18.276 --> 00:15:19.786
And now what I did there

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.408
is, I was being nasty,
I just turned up the heat again and again.

00:15:23.432 --> 00:15:25.778
And of course, it reaches
the viability threshold.

00:15:25.802 --> 00:15:28.670
And I'm just showing this to you
again because it's so nice.

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:30.236
You hit the viability threshold.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.236
The distribution changes to "alive!"

00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:35.908
And then, once you hit the threshold

00:15:35.932 --> 00:15:39.981
where the mutation rate is so high
that you cannot self-reproduce,

00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:44.926
you cannot copy the information
forward to your offspring

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.680
without making so many mistakes
that your ability to replicate vanishes.

00:15:49.704 --> 00:15:51.563
And then, that signature is lost.

00:15:53.216 --> 00:15:54.922
What do we learn from that?

00:15:54.946 --> 00:15:58.742
Well, I think we learn
a number of things from that.

00:15:58.766 --> 00:16:00.236
One of them is,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:05.484
if we are able to think about life
in abstract terms --

00:16:05.508 --> 00:16:08.139
and we're not talking
about things like plants,

00:16:08.163 --> 00:16:10.088
and we're not talking about amino acids,

00:16:10.112 --> 00:16:11.876
and we're not talking about bacteria,

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.010
but we think in terms of processes --

00:16:14.034 --> 00:16:16.236
then we could start to think about life

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.879
not as something
that is so special to Earth,

00:16:18.903 --> 00:16:21.413
but that, in fact, could exist anywhere.

00:16:21.437 --> 00:16:25.750
Because it really only has to do
with these concepts of information,

00:16:25.774 --> 00:16:29.832
of storing information
within physical substrates --

00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:33.872
anything: bits, nucleic acids,
anything that's an alphabet --

00:16:33.896 --> 00:16:35.775
and make sure that there's some process

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:39.514
so that this information can be stored
for much longer than you would expect --

00:16:40.076 --> 00:16:44.412
the time scales for
the deterioration of information.

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:47.604
And if you can do that,
then you have life.

00:16:47.628 --> 00:16:49.882
So the first thing that we learn

00:16:49.906 --> 00:16:55.118
is that it is possible to define life
in terms of processes alone,

00:16:55.142 --> 00:17:00.119
without referring at all
to the type of things that we hold dear,

00:17:00.143 --> 00:17:02.814
as far as the type of life on Earth is.

00:17:02.838 --> 00:17:05.479
And that, in a sense, removes us again,

00:17:05.503 --> 00:17:08.334
like all of our scientific discoveries,
or many of them --

00:17:08.358 --> 00:17:11.129
it's this continuous dethroning of man --

00:17:11.153 --> 00:17:13.880
of how we think we're special
because we're alive.

00:17:13.904 --> 00:17:16.960
Well, we can make life;
we can make life in the computer.

00:17:16.984 --> 00:17:18.801
Granted, it's limited,

00:17:18.825 --> 00:17:23.942
but we have learned what it takes
in order to actually construct it.

00:17:23.966 --> 00:17:26.754
And once we have that,

00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:29.425
then it is not such
a difficult task anymore

00:17:29.449 --> 00:17:33.601
to say, if we understand
the fundamental processes

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:36.967
that do not refer
to any particular substrate,

00:17:36.991 --> 00:17:40.759
then we can go out and try other worlds,

00:17:40.783 --> 00:17:44.564
figure out what kind of chemical
alphabets might there be,

00:17:45.293 --> 00:17:50.018
figure enough about the normal chemistry,
the geochemistry of the planet,

00:17:50.042 --> 00:17:53.816
so that we know what this distribution
would look like in the absence of life,

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.811
and then look for large
deviations from this --

00:17:56.835 --> 00:18:01.947
this thing sticking out, which says,
"This chemical really shouldn't be there."

00:18:01.971 --> 00:18:03.926
Now we don't know that there's life then,

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.157
but we could say,

00:18:05.181 --> 00:18:08.950
"Well at least I'm going to have to take
a look very precisely at this chemical

00:18:08.974 --> 00:18:11.019
and see where it comes from."

00:18:11.043 --> 00:18:14.754
And that might be our chance
of actually discovering life

00:18:14.778 --> 00:18:16.897
when we cannot visibly see it.

00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:21.485
And so that's really the only
take-home message that I have for you.

00:18:21.509 --> 00:18:25.740
Life can be less mysterious
than we make it out to be

00:18:25.764 --> 00:18:28.969
when we try to think
about how it would be on other planets.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.927
And if we remove the mystery of life,

00:18:32.951 --> 00:18:37.636
then I think it is a little bit easier
for us to think about how we live,

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.718
and how perhaps we're not as special
as we always think we are.

00:18:40.742 --> 00:18:42.988
And I'm going to leave you with that.

00:18:43.012 --> 00:18:44.236
And thank you very much.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.434
(Applause)
