00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Contagious is a good word.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Inspiration is contagious.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.260
We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
But for me, what was contagious about all of them

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
was that they were infected by something I call the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
"I Can" bug.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
So, the question is, why only them?

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
In a country of a billion people and some,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
why so few?

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
Is it luck? Is it chance?

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Can we all not systematically and consciously

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
get infected?

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
I got infected when I was 17,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
when, as a student of the design college,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and how contagious that feeling was.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.260
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.260
a lab to prototype and refine a design process

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
And I uncovered

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
that if learning is embedded in real-world context,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
that if you blur the boundaries between school and life,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
then children go through a journey of "aware,"

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
where they can see the change,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
"enable," be changed,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and then "empower," lead the change.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And that directly increased student wellbeing.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Children became more competent,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and less helpless.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
But this was all common sense.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
common practice looks like at Riverside.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.260
A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
they were made to roll incense sticks,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
agarbattis, for eight hours

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.260
to experience what it means to be a child laborer.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
It transformed them. What you will see is their journey,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and then their utter conviction

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
that they could go out and change the world.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
(Music)

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
That's them rolling.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And in two hours, after their backs were broke,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
they were changed.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And once that happened,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
they were out in the city convincing everybody

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
that child labor just had to be abolished.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
because he's been able to understand that he

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
has shifted that man's mindset.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And that can't happen in a classroom.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.260
So, when Ragav experienced that

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
he went from "teacher told me,"

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
But we had parents who said,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
but what about math and science and English?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Show us the grades."

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And we did. The data was conclusive.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
When children are empowered,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
not only do they do good,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
they do well, in fact very well,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
taken by over 2,000 schools in India,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
in math, English and science.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.260
So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.260
So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.260
the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Now it was not about Riverside school.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
It was about all children. So, we were shameless.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
the press, businesses,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
and basically said, "When are you going to wake up

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and recognize the potential that resides in every child?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
When will you include the child in the city?

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child."

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
So, how did the city respond?

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
Since 2007 every other month

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
and converts it into a playground for children and childhood.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.260
Here was a city telling its child, "You can."

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Video: [Unclear]

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
So, the busiest streets closed down.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.260
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
It gets taken over by children.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
They are skating. They are doing street plays.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.260
They are playing, all free, for all children.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:05:02.260
(Music)

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
(Music)

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Kiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.260
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
in the future the children will give back to the city.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
(Music)

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
KBS: And because of that,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
So, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.260
It was time now to infect India.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
So, on August 15th,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
again, Independence Day, 2009,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
empowered with the same process,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.260
we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
How? We designed a simple toolkit,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
converted it into eight languages,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
and reached 32,000 schools.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
We basically gave children a very simple challenge.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
We said, take one idea,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
anything that bothers you,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
choose one week,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and change a billion lives.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And they did. Stories of change

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
poured in from all over India,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
from Nagaland in the east,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
to Jhunjhunu in the west,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
from Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
to alcoholism,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
in Rajasthan.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
I mean, it was incredible.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and say, "You can," then they will.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
Infection in India.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
This is in Rajasthan, a rural village.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Child: Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
KBS: First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school --

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.260
unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Look at what their parents says.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
Man: This program is wonderful.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.260
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Woman: I am so happy that my students did this campaign.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
See? They have done it.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
KBS: An inner city school in Hyderabad.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
Girl: 581. This house is 581 ...

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
We have to start collecting from 555.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
KBS: Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
pretty difficult, but they did it.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.260
Woman: Even though they are so young, they have done such good work.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:56.260
First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Woman: It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
that they had so much inside them.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Girl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
for a very good cause,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes!

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
KBS: So, the charter of compassion starts right here.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Street plays, auctions, petitions.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
I mean, they were changing lives.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
It was incredible.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
So, how can we still stay immune?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.260
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
I know it's obvious,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.260
but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
70 years ago, it took one man

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
to infect an entire nation

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
with the power of "We can."

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
So, today who is it going to take

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
to spread the infection from 100,000 children

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
to the 200 million children in India?

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.260
Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
So, if not us, then who?

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
If not now, then when?

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Like I said, contagious is a good word.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
Thank you.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:25.260
(Applause)
