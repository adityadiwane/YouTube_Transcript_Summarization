00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:17.547
What's the scariest thing you've ever done?

00:00:17.547 --> 00:00:20.597
Or another way to say it is,

00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:24.071
what's the most dangerous 
thing that you've ever done?

00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:28.254
And why did you do it?

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:29.872
I know what the most dangerous thing is

00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:31.065
that I've ever done

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:33.349
because NASA does the math.

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:35.701
You look back to the first five shuttle launches,

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:38.289
the odds of a catastrophic event

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:39.869
during the first five shuttle launches

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:42.793
was one in nine.

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:44.691
And even when I first flew in the shuttle

00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:47.379
back in 1995, 74 shuttle flight,

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.369
the odds were still now that we look back

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:55.037
about one in 38 or so -- one in 35, one in 40.

00:00:55.037 --> 00:00:57.604
Not great odds, so it's a really interesting day

00:00:57.604 --> 00:00:59.896
when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center

00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:02.266
and you're going to go to space that day

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.001
because you realize by the end of the day

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.631
you're either going to be floating 
effortlessly, gloriously in space,

00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:10.748
or you'll be dead.

00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:14.108
You go into, at the Kennedy Space Center,

00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:16.098
the suit-up room,

00:01:16.098 --> 00:01:20.353
the same room that our childhood heroes

00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:21.611
got dressed in,

00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:24.586
that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in

00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:26.727
to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon.

00:01:26.727 --> 00:01:30.194
And I got my pressure suit built around me

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:34.056
and rode down outside in the van

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:35.631
heading out to the launchpad --

00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:38.533
in the Astro van -- heading out to the launchpad,

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.642
and as you come around the corner

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:42.647
at the Kennedy Space Center,

00:01:42.647 --> 00:01:46.017
it's normally predawn, and in the distance,

00:01:46.032 --> 00:01:49.034
lit up by the huge xenon lights,

00:01:49.034 --> 00:01:52.449
is your spaceship --

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:56.289
the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.893
The crew is sitting in the Astro van

00:01:58.893 --> 00:02:01.008
sort of hushed, almost holding hands,

00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:03.557
looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger.

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:06.000
We ride the elevator up

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.355
and we crawl in, on your hands and knees

00:02:08.355 --> 00:02:10.003
into the spaceship, one at a time,

00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:11.650
and you worm your way up

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.217
into your chair and plunk yourself down

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:16.505
on your back.

00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:20.453
And the hatch is closed,

00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:22.600
and suddenly,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.270
what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.725
is becoming real,

00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:29.798
something that I dreamed about,

00:02:29.798 --> 00:02:32.345
in fact, that I chose to do when I was nine years old,

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:35.719
is now suddenly within not too many minutes

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.577
of actually happening.

00:02:37.577 --> 00:02:40.260
In the astronaut business --

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.133
the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle;

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:45.944
it's the most complicated flying machine ever built.

00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:49.305
And in the astronaut business, 
we have a saying, which is,

00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:51.273
there is no problem so bad

00:02:51.273 --> 00:02:53.593
that you can't make it worse.

00:02:53.593 --> 00:02:54.831
(Laughter)

00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:57.933
And so you're very conscious in the cockpit;

00:02:57.933 --> 00:02:59.371
you're thinking about all of the things

00:02:59.371 --> 00:03:00.562
that you might have to do,

00:03:00.562 --> 00:03:02.873
all the switches and all the 
wickets you have to go through.

00:03:02.873 --> 00:03:05.066
And as the time gets closer and closer,

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:06.735
this excitement is building.

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:08.895
And then about three and a 
half minutes before launch,

00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:10.702
the huge nozzles on the back,

00:03:10.702 --> 00:03:12.386
like the size of big church bells,

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:13.515
swing back and forth

00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:14.860
and the mass of them is such

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.557
that it sways the whole vehicle,

00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:19.441
like the vehicle is alive underneath you,

00:03:19.441 --> 00:03:23.095
like an elephant getting up 
off its knees or something.

00:03:23.095 --> 00:03:25.391
And then about 30 seconds before launch,

00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:27.223
the vehicle is completely alive --

00:03:27.223 --> 00:03:28.430
it is ready to go --

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.591
the APUs are running,

00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.460
the computers are all self-contained,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.949
it's ready to leave the planet.

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.237
And 15 seconds before launch, this happens:

00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:40.675
(Video) Voice: 12, 11, 10,

00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:44.703
nine, eight, seven, six --

00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:47.251
(Space shuttle preparing for takeoff)

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:50.143
-- start, two, one,

00:03:50.143 --> 00:03:54.286
booster ignition, and liftoff of 
the space shuttle Discovery,

00:03:54.286 --> 00:03:58.317
returning to the space station, paving the way ...

00:03:58.317 --> 00:04:09.884
(Space shuttle taking off)

00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:13.161
Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful

00:04:13.161 --> 00:04:14.964
to be on board one of these things.

00:04:14.964 --> 00:04:16.995
You are in the grip of something

00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:19.192
that is vastly more powerful than yourself.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.815
It's shaking you so hard you can't focus

00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:23.262
on the instruments in front of you.

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:26.178
It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog

00:04:26.178 --> 00:04:28.924
and there's a foot in the small of your back

00:04:28.924 --> 00:04:30.451
pushing you into space,

00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:32.500
accelerating wildly straight up,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.202
shouldering your way through the air,

00:04:34.202 --> 00:04:36.733
and you're in a very complex place --

00:04:36.733 --> 00:04:38.538
paying attention, watching the vehicle

00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:40.189
go through each one of its wickets

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.610
with a steadily increasing smile on your face.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.807
After two minutes, those solid rockets explode off

00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:48.221
and then you just have the liquid engines,

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.674
the hydrogen and oxygen,

00:04:49.674 --> 00:04:51.141
and it's as if you're in a dragster

00:04:51.141 --> 00:04:52.916
with your foot to the floor

00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:55.335
and accelerating like you've never accelerated.

00:04:55.335 --> 00:04:56.650
You get lighter and lighter,

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.076
the force gets on us heavier and heavier.

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:00.452
It feels like

00:05:00.452 --> 00:05:02.536
someone's pouring cement on you or something.

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:03.820
Until finally,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.488
after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so,

00:05:06.488 --> 00:05:08.683
we are finally at exactly the right altitude,

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.765
exactly the right speed,

00:05:10.765 --> 00:05:13.845
the right direction, the engine shut off,

00:05:13.845 --> 00:05:16.067
and we're weightless.

00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:18.969
And we're alive.

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:20.425
It's an amazing experience.

00:05:20.425 --> 00:05:23.733
But why would we take that risk?

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:27.453
Why would you do something that dangerous?

00:05:27.453 --> 00:05:29.522
In my case the answer is fairly straightforward.

00:05:29.522 --> 00:05:32.576
I was inspired as a youngster

00:05:32.576 --> 00:05:34.167
that this was what I wanted to do.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.360
I watched the first people walk on the moon

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.591
and to me, it was just an obvious thing --

00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:41.593
I want to somehow turn myself into that.

00:05:41.593 --> 00:05:42.775
But the real question is,

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:45.390
how do you deal with the danger of it

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.546
and the fear that comes from it?

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:51.244
How do you deal with fear versus danger?

00:05:51.244 --> 00:05:54.311
And having the goal in mind,
thinking about where it might lead,

00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:56.120
directed me to a life of

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.465
looking at all of the small details to allow

00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:01.166
this to become possible,

00:06:01.166 --> 00:06:04.075
to be able to launch and go 
help build a space station

00:06:04.075 --> 00:06:06.535
where you are on board a million-pound creation

00:06:06.535 --> 00:06:09.371
that's going around the world at five miles a second,

00:06:09.371 --> 00:06:10.746
eight kilometers a second,

00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:13.255
around the world 16 times a day,

00:06:13.255 --> 00:06:17.240
with experiments on board that are teaching us

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.232
what the substance of the universe is made of

00:06:19.232 --> 00:06:21.818
and running 200 experiments inside.

00:06:21.818 --> 00:06:23.666
But maybe even more importantly,

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:27.483
allowing us to see the world in a way

00:06:27.483 --> 00:06:30.105
that is impossible through any other means,

00:06:30.105 --> 00:06:31.644
to be able to look down

00:06:31.644 --> 00:06:34.947
and have -- if your jaw could drop, it would --

00:06:34.947 --> 00:06:38.937
the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb

00:06:38.937 --> 00:06:43.700
like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic,

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.411
constantly changing beauty that is the world itself.

00:06:47.411 --> 00:06:48.946
And you see, because of the speed,

00:06:48.946 --> 00:06:52.772
a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes

00:06:52.772 --> 00:06:55.941
for half a year.

00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:58.392
And the most magnificent part of all that

00:06:58.392 --> 00:07:01.191
is to go outside on a spacewalk.

00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:06.599
You are in a one-person spaceship

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:08.067
that is your spacesuit,

00:07:08.067 --> 00:07:11.831
and you're going through space with the world.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.584
It's an entirely different perspective,

00:07:13.584 --> 00:07:14.999
you're not looking up at the universe,

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:18.481
you and the Earth are going 
through the universe together.

00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:20.280
And you're holding on with one hand,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.404
looking at the world turn beside you.

00:07:22.404 --> 00:07:26.196
It's roaring silently

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:28.965
with color and texture as it pours by

00:07:28.965 --> 00:07:30.941
mesmerizingly next to you.

00:07:30.941 --> 00:07:33.627
And if you can tear your eyes away from that

00:07:33.627 --> 00:07:35.089
and you look under your arm

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:37.327
down at the rest of everything,

00:07:37.327 --> 00:07:42.724
it's unfathomable blackness,

00:07:42.724 --> 00:07:45.792
with a texture you feel like you 
could stick your hand into.

00:07:45.792 --> 00:07:48.207
and you are holding on with one hand,

00:07:48.207 --> 00:07:50.632
one link to the other seven billion people.

00:07:50.632 --> 00:07:52.770
And I was outside on my first spacewalk

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.546
when my left eye went blind,

00:07:56.546 --> 00:07:58.216
and I didn't know why.

00:07:58.216 --> 00:07:59.826
Suddenly my left eye slammed shut

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:00.950
in great pain

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.009
and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working.

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:06.365
I was thinking, what do I do next?

00:08:06.365 --> 00:08:08.620
I thought, well maybe that's why we have two eyes,

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.873
so I kept working.

00:08:09.873 --> 00:08:13.212
But unfortunately, without gravity,

00:08:13.212 --> 00:08:15.142
tears don't fall.

00:08:15.142 --> 00:08:18.166
So you just get a bigger and 
bigger ball of whatever that is

00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:20.174
mixed with your tears on your eye

00:08:20.174 --> 00:08:22.652
until eventually, the ball becomes so big

00:08:22.652 --> 00:08:25.213
that the surface tension takes it 
across the bridge of your nose

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:26.947
like a tiny little waterfall

00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:29.022
and goes "goosh" into your other eye,

00:08:29.023 --> 00:08:32.490
and now I was completely blind

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.588
outside the spaceship.

00:08:35.588 --> 00:08:38.167
So what's the scariest thing you've ever done?

00:08:38.167 --> 00:08:41.869
(Laughter)

00:08:41.869 --> 00:08:43.349
Maybe it's spiders.

00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:44.878
A lot of people are afraid of spiders.

00:08:44.878 --> 00:08:46.607
I think you should be afraid of spiders --

00:08:46.607 --> 00:08:49.290
spiders are creepy and they've got long, hairy legs,

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.717
and spiders like this one, the brown recluse --

00:08:52.717 --> 00:08:54.859
it's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you,

00:08:54.859 --> 00:08:56.593
you end with one of these 
horrible, big necrotic things

00:08:56.593 --> 00:08:57.696
on your leg

00:08:57.696 --> 00:08:58.949
and there might be one right now

00:08:58.949 --> 00:09:02.027
sitting on the chair behind you, in fact.

00:09:02.027 --> 00:09:03.112
And how do you know?

00:09:03.112 --> 00:09:04.486
And so a spider lands on you,

00:09:04.486 --> 00:09:06.527
and you go through this great, spasmy attack

00:09:06.527 --> 00:09:08.255
because spiders are scary.

00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:10.759
But then you could say, well 
is there a brown recluse

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.134
sitting on the chair beside me or not?

00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:14.148
I don't know. Are there brown recluses here?

00:09:14.148 --> 00:09:16.831
So if you actually do the research, you find out that

00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:19.876
in the world there are about 
50,000 different types of spiders,

00:09:19.876 --> 00:09:22.551
and there are about two dozen that are venomous

00:09:22.551 --> 00:09:23.902
out of 50,000.

00:09:23.902 --> 00:09:26.270
And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.750
here in B.C., there's about 720, 
730 different types of spiders

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.652
and there's one -- one --

00:09:32.652 --> 00:09:33.511
that is venomous,

00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:35.217
and its venom isn't even fatal,

00:09:35.217 --> 00:09:37.118
it's just kind of like a nasty sting.

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.043
And that spider -- not only that,

00:09:39.043 --> 00:09:42.256
but that spider has beautiful markings on it,

00:09:42.256 --> 00:09:46.404
it's like "I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation 
symbol on my back, it's the black widow."

00:09:46.404 --> 00:09:48.662
So, if you're even slightly careful

00:09:48.662 --> 00:09:51.104
you can avoid running into the one spider --

00:09:51.104 --> 00:09:53.250
and it lives close the ground,

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.702
you're walking along, you are 
never going to go through

00:09:55.702 --> 00:09:57.552
a spider web where a black widow bites you.

00:09:57.552 --> 00:09:59.525
Spider webs like this, it doesn't build those,

00:09:59.525 --> 00:10:01.155
it builds them down in the corners.

00:10:01.155 --> 00:10:02.747
And its a black widow because

00:10:02.747 --> 00:10:04.086
the female spider eats the male;

00:10:04.086 --> 00:10:05.877
it doesn't care about you.

00:10:05.877 --> 00:10:07.342
So in fact,

00:10:07.342 --> 00:10:09.641
the next time you walk into a spiderweb,

00:10:09.641 --> 00:10:13.516
you don't need to panic and go 
with your caveman reaction.

00:10:13.516 --> 00:10:18.105
The danger is entirely different than the fear.

00:10:18.105 --> 00:10:20.438
How do you get around it, though?

00:10:20.438 --> 00:10:21.692
How do you change your behavior?

00:10:21.692 --> 00:10:23.176
Well, next time you see a spiderweb,

00:10:23.176 --> 00:10:25.390
have a good look, make sure 
it's not a black widow spider,

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.182
and then walk into it.

00:10:27.182 --> 00:10:28.820
And then you see another spiderweb

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.042
and walk into that one.

00:10:30.042 --> 00:10:32.288
It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal.

00:10:32.288 --> 00:10:35.804
And the spider that may come out is 
no more threat to you than a lady bug

00:10:35.804 --> 00:10:38.672
or a butterfly.

00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:41.600
And then I guarantee you if you 
walk through 100 spiderwebs

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.188
you will have changed

00:10:43.188 --> 00:10:45.743
your fundamental human behavior,

00:10:45.743 --> 00:10:47.248
your caveman reaction,

00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:50.075
and you will now be able to walk 
in the park in the morning

00:10:50.075 --> 00:10:51.864
and not worry about that spiderweb --

00:10:51.864 --> 00:10:54.324
or into your grandma's attic or whatever,

00:10:54.324 --> 00:10:59.409
into your own basement.

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:02.920
And you can apply this to anything.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.735
If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded,

00:11:05.735 --> 00:11:08.359
your natural reaction would be to panic, I think.

00:11:08.359 --> 00:11:10.419
It would make you nervous and worried.

00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:12.907
But we had considered all the venom,

00:11:12.907 --> 00:11:15.788
and we had practiced with a whole 
variety of different spiderwebs.

00:11:15.788 --> 00:11:17.522
We knew everything there is to know

00:11:17.522 --> 00:11:18.980
about the spacesuit

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.493
and we trained underwater thousands of times.

00:11:21.493 --> 00:11:23.224
And we don't just practice things going right,

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:26.048
we practice things going wrong all the time,

00:11:26.048 --> 00:11:29.312
so that you are constantly walking 
through those spiderwebs.

00:11:29.312 --> 00:11:32.389
And not just underwater, but 
also in virtual reality labs

00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:33.780
with the helmet and the gloves

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.187
so you feel like it's realistic.

00:11:35.187 --> 00:11:38.515
So when you finally actually 
get outside on a spacewalk,

00:11:38.515 --> 00:11:40.477
it feels much different than it would

00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:42.315
if you just went out first time.

00:11:42.315 --> 00:11:44.076
And even if you're blinded,

00:11:44.076 --> 00:11:47.722
your natural, panicky reaction doesn't happen.

00:11:47.722 --> 00:11:49.081
Instead you kind of look around and go,

00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:50.733
"Okay, I can't see,

00:11:50.733 --> 00:11:53.155
but I can hear, I can talk,

00:11:53.155 --> 00:11:54.884
Scott Parazynski is out here with me.

00:11:54.884 --> 00:11:56.315
He could come over and help me."

00:11:56.315 --> 00:12:00.229
We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue,

00:12:00.229 --> 00:12:02.020
so he could float me like a blimp

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.195
and stuff me into the airlock if he had to.

00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:06.395
I could find my own way back.

00:12:06.395 --> 00:12:07.765
It's not nearly as big a deal.

00:12:07.765 --> 00:12:09.787
And actually, if you keep on crying for a while,

00:12:09.787 --> 00:12:12.182
whatever that gunk was that's 
in your eye starts to dilute

00:12:12.182 --> 00:12:13.702
and you can start to see again,

00:12:13.702 --> 00:12:15.769
and Houston, if you negotiate with them,

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:18.766
they will let you then keep working.

00:12:18.766 --> 00:12:20.825
We finished everything on the spacewalk

00:12:20.825 --> 00:12:22.422
and when we came back inside,

00:12:22.422 --> 00:12:26.145
Jeff got some cotton batting and took 
the crusty stuff around my eyes,

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:28.597
and it turned out it was just the anti-fog,

00:12:28.597 --> 00:12:32.044
sort of a mixture of oil and soap, that got in my eye.

00:12:32.044 --> 00:12:35.592
And now we use Johnson's No More Tears,

00:12:35.592 --> 00:12:36.907
which we probably should've been using

00:12:36.907 --> 00:12:40.543
right from the very beginning. (Laughter)

00:12:40.543 --> 00:12:45.489
But the key to that is

00:12:45.489 --> 00:12:47.044
by looking at the difference

00:12:47.044 --> 00:12:49.039
between perceived danger and actual danger,

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:50.406
where is the real risk?

00:12:50.406 --> 00:12:52.460
What is the real thing that you should be afraid of?

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.228
Not just a generic fear of bad things happening.

00:12:55.228 --> 00:12:57.595
You can fundamentally change 
your reaction to things

00:12:57.595 --> 00:13:00.532
so that it allows you to go places

00:13:00.532 --> 00:13:02.169
and see things and do things

00:13:02.169 --> 00:13:04.665
that otherwise would be completely denied to you ...

00:13:04.665 --> 00:13:08.012
where you could see the 
hardpan south of the Sahara,

00:13:08.012 --> 00:13:09.964
or you can see New York City

00:13:09.964 --> 00:13:12.063
in a way that is almost dreamlike,

00:13:12.063 --> 00:13:16.586
or the unconscious gingham 
of Eastern Europe fields

00:13:16.586 --> 00:13:18.717
or the Great Lakes

00:13:18.717 --> 00:13:21.458
as a collection of small puddles.

00:13:21.473 --> 00:13:24.703
You can see the fault lines of San Francisco

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:26.601
and the way the water pours out under the bridge,

00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:28.333
just entirely different

00:13:28.333 --> 00:13:30.002
than any other way that you could have

00:13:30.002 --> 00:13:33.285
if you had not found a way to conquer your fear.

00:13:33.285 --> 00:13:35.724
You see a beauty that otherwise

00:13:35.724 --> 00:13:38.201
never would have happened.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:41.448
It's time to come home at the end.

00:13:41.448 --> 00:13:42.767
This is our spaceship,

00:13:42.767 --> 00:13:43.874
the Soyuz, that little one.

00:13:43.874 --> 00:13:45.339
Three of us climb in,

00:13:45.339 --> 00:13:47.791
and then this spaceship detaches from the station

00:13:47.791 --> 00:13:49.461
and falls into the atmosphere.

00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:51.083
These two parts here

00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:53.247
actually melt, we jettison them and they burn up

00:13:53.247 --> 00:13:54.329
in the atmosphere.

00:13:54.329 --> 00:13:56.582
The only part that survives is the little bullet

00:13:56.582 --> 00:13:57.758
that we're riding in,

00:13:57.758 --> 00:13:59.796
and it falls into the atmosphere,

00:13:59.796 --> 00:14:01.372
and in essence

00:14:01.372 --> 00:14:04.933
you are riding a meteorite home,

00:14:04.933 --> 00:14:07.866
and riding meteorites is scary,

00:14:07.866 --> 00:14:09.379
and it ought to be.

00:14:09.379 --> 00:14:11.618
But instead of riding into the atmosphere

00:14:11.618 --> 00:14:12.856
just screaming, like you would

00:14:12.856 --> 00:14:15.201
if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite

00:14:15.201 --> 00:14:18.131
back to Earth -- (Laughter) --

00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:20.555
instead, 20 years previously

00:14:20.555 --> 00:14:23.171
we had started studying Russian,

00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:25.751
and then once you learn Russian, then we

00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:28.265
learned orbital mechanics in Russian,

00:14:28.265 --> 00:14:31.235
and then we learned vehicle control theory,

00:14:31.235 --> 00:14:32.704
and then we got into the simulator

00:14:32.704 --> 00:14:35.276
and practiced over and over and over again.

00:14:35.276 --> 00:14:37.286
And in fact, you can fly this meteorite

00:14:37.286 --> 00:14:39.495
and steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle

00:14:39.495 --> 00:14:40.919
anywhere on the Earth.

00:14:40.919 --> 00:14:43.844
So in fact, when our crew was coming back

00:14:43.844 --> 00:14:46.404
into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz,

00:14:46.404 --> 00:14:48.780
we weren't screaming, we were laughing;

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.848
it was fun.

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:51.776
And when the great big parachute opened,

00:14:51.776 --> 00:14:52.995
we knew that if it didn't open

00:14:52.995 --> 00:14:54.210
there's a second parachute,

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.391
and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism.

00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:58.773
So we came back, we came thundering back

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.659
to Earth and this is what it looked like

00:15:00.659 --> 00:15:03.259
to land in a Soyuz, in Kazakhstan.

00:15:03.259 --> 00:15:05.282
(Video) Reporter: And you can see one of those

00:15:05.282 --> 00:15:07.998
search and recovery helicopters, once again

00:15:07.998 --> 00:15:11.009
that helicopter part of dozen such Russian

00:15:11.009 --> 00:15:15.637
Mi-8 helicopters.

00:15:15.637 --> 00:15:19.546
Touchdown -- 3:14 and 48 seconds,

00:15:19.546 --> 00:15:21.021
a.m. Central Time.

00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:22.192
CH: And you roll to a stop

00:15:22.192 --> 00:15:23.861
as if someone threw your 
spaceship at the ground

00:15:23.861 --> 00:15:25.243
and it tumbles end over end,

00:15:25.243 --> 00:15:26.249
but you're ready for it

00:15:26.249 --> 00:15:27.625
you're in a custom-built seat,

00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:29.062
you know how the shock absorber works.

00:15:29.062 --> 00:15:31.053
And then eventually the Russians reach in,

00:15:31.053 --> 00:15:32.211
drag you out,

00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:33.911
plunk you into a chair,

00:15:33.911 --> 00:15:37.354
and you can now look back at

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:40.536
what was an incredible experience.

00:15:40.536 --> 00:15:42.503
You have taken the dreams of that

00:15:42.503 --> 00:15:44.115
nine-year-old boy,

00:15:44.115 --> 00:15:45.754
which were impossible

00:15:45.754 --> 00:15:48.644
and dauntingly scary,

00:15:48.644 --> 00:15:50.344
dauntingly terrifying,

00:15:50.344 --> 00:15:53.068
and put them into practice,

00:15:53.068 --> 00:15:56.301
and figured out a way to reprogram yourself,

00:15:56.301 --> 00:15:58.429
to change your primal fear

00:15:58.429 --> 00:16:01.328
so that it allowed you to come back

00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:05.268
with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration

00:16:05.268 --> 00:16:06.611
for other people

00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:09.737
that never could have been possible otherwise.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:17.347
Just to finish, they asked me to play that guitar.

00:16:17.347 --> 00:16:19.607
I know this song,

00:16:19.607 --> 00:16:24.827
and it's really a tribute to the genius

00:16:24.827 --> 00:16:26.860
of David Bowie himself,

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.773
but it's also, I think,

00:16:28.773 --> 00:16:31.211
a reflection of the fact that we are not machines

00:16:31.211 --> 00:16:32.544
exploring the universe,

00:16:32.544 --> 00:16:33.657
we are people,

00:16:33.657 --> 00:16:35.821
and we're taking

00:16:35.821 --> 00:16:37.997
that ability to adapt

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.527
and that ability to understand

00:16:39.527 --> 00:16:41.503
and the ability to take

00:16:41.503 --> 00:16:45.862
our own self-perception into a new place.

00:16:46.369 --> 00:16:52.099
(Music)

00:16:52.099 --> 00:16:56.772
♫ This is Major Tom to ground control ♫

00:16:56.772 --> 00:17:01.831
♫ I've left forevermore ♫

00:17:01.831 --> 00:17:08.638
♫ And I'm floating in a most peculiar way ♫

00:17:08.638 --> 00:17:15.743
♫ And the stars look very different today ♫

00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:23.197
♫ For here am I floating in the tin can ♫

00:17:23.197 --> 00:17:30.027
♫ A last glimpse of the world ♫

00:17:30.027 --> 00:17:37.205
♫ Planet Earth is blue and 
there's so much left to do ♫

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:56.783
(Music)

00:17:56.783 --> 00:17:58.309
Fear not.

00:17:58.309 --> 00:18:11.552
(Applause)

00:18:11.552 --> 00:18:14.738
That's very nice of you. Thank you very much.

00:18:14.738 --> 00:18:16.905
Thank you.
