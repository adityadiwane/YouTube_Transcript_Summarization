00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
I write about food. I write about cooking.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
I take it quite seriously,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
but I'm here to talk about something

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
that's become very important to me in the last year or two.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.160
It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
I'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right?

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
But I still think that this --

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.160
(Laughter)

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
-- may be this year's version of this.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.160
Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
And why do I say it?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.160
Because only once before has the fate of individual people

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
and the fate of all of humanity

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
been so intertwined.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
There was the bomb, and there's now.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
And where we go from here is going to determine

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.160
not only the quality and the length of our individual lives,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
we'd recognize it.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
It's a holocaust of a different kind,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
and hiding under our desks isn't going to help.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
Start with the notion that global warming

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
is not only real, but dangerous.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
Since every scientist in the world now believes this,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
we can take this is a given.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
Then hear this, please.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
to atmosphere-altering gases.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.160
Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
is generated by livestock production --

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
more than transportation.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.160
Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
and it's not just methane.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.160
air and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.160
There's more.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
Like half the antibiotics in this country

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
are not administered to people, but to animals.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this:

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
if you're a progressive,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
or you're looking for organic,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
you should probably be a semi-vegetarian.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
but it's all in the way we use these things.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
There's another piece of the puzzle,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
and one you already know.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.160
There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases --

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.160
diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers --

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
are diseases that are far more prevalent here

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160
than anywhere in the rest of the world.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.160
And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates --

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.160
the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day --

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
our demand for these things, not our need, our want,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.160
And those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
Now global warming was unforeseen.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.160
We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
but, you know, that's not such a big deal.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
The current health crisis, however,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
is a little more the work of the evil empire.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
We were told, we were assured,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
the healthier we'd be.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
No. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.160
is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear --

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.160
it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.160
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
This evidence is overwhelming at this point.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160
You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
Not bad.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
But back to animals and junk food.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
What do they have in common?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
One: we don't need either of them for health.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
We don't need animal products,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
Two: both have been marketed heavily,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
creating unnatural demand.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.160
We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
Three: their production has been supported by government agencies

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.160
Now, let's imagine a parallel.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
knowing all the while that the result would be

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
pollution, war and rising costs.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
Incredible, isn't it?

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Yet they do that.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
And they do this here. It's the same deal.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
The sad thing is, when it comes to diet,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
is that even when well-intentioned Feds

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.160
try to do right by us, they fail.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.160
Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
or they are puppets of agribusiness.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.160
So, when the USDA finally acknowledged

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.160
that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.160
they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160
along with more carbs.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.160
What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
and that plants and whole grains

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
should be supplanting eating junk food.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
And guess what?

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
Half the people who developed the food pyramid

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
have ties to agribusiness.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
So, instead of substituting plants for animals,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
our swollen appetites simply became larger,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.160
and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.160
So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets --

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
these are not solutions.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
But with lots of intelligent people

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
focusing on whether food is organic or local,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
or whether we're being nice to animals,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
the most important issues just aren't being addressed.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160
I like animals,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.160
and to churn them out like they were wrenches.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160
But there's no way to treat animals well,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
when you're killing 10 billion of them a year.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
That's our number. 10 billion.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
If you strung all of them --

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.160
chickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
they'd go there and back five times, there and back.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
Now, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
but you get the idea.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
That's just the United States.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
producing greenhouse gases and heart disease,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
kindness might just be a bit of a red herring.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.160
Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.160
and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.160
Another red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore,"

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Seriously.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
And locavore, for those of you who don't know,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
is someone who eats only locally grown food --

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
which is fine if you live in California,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
Between the official story -- the food pyramid --

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
and the hip locavore vision,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
you have two versions of how to improve our eating.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
(Laughter).

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160
They both get it wrong, though.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.160
The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.160
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
And I'm going to go through that,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
A hundred years ago, guess what?

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.160
Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
Every family had a cook, usually a mom.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
And those moms bought and prepared food.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
It was like your romantic vision of Europe.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
Margarine didn't exist.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
In fact, when margarine was invented,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.160
several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.160
so we'd all know that it was a fake.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
There was no snack food, and until the '20s,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
There were no restaurant chains.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
but none of them would think to open another one.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
And fancy food was entirely French.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
As an aside, those of you who remember

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.160
Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:47.160
can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.160
(Laughter)

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.160
Back in those days, before even Julia,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
back in those days, there was no philosophy of food.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
You just ate.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
You didn't claim to be anything.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
There was no marketing. There were no national brands.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.160
Vitamins had not been invented.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.160
Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
You ate food.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
because it was an ingredient.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
The cornflake hadn't been invented.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.160
(Laughter)

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
Goldfish swam.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
(Laughter)

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
It's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
And again, everyone ate local.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160
because it came all the way from Florida.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
From the '30s on, road systems expanded,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
trucks took the place of railroads,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
fresh food began to travel more.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
Oranges became common in New York.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
The South and West became agricultural hubs,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
as is almost everything

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
from the demise of the real community

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.160
to the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
Thus arrived convenience.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160
It was sold to proto-feminist housewives

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160
as a way to cut down on housework.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
Now, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 --

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
their mouths are watering at this point.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.160
(Laughter)

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.160
(Applause)

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.160
If we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.160
(Laughter)

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
But this may have cut down on housework,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.160
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.160
except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
I, for one -- and I'm not kidding --

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.160
didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.160
Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
than broiling a steak?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.160
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
Rather than spending their lives eating grass,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
for which their stomachs were designed,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
they were forced to eat soy and corn.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
They have trouble digesting those grains, of course,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160
but that wasn't a problem for producers.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
New drugs kept them healthy.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
Well, they kept them alive.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
Healthy was another story.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.160
Thanks to farm subsidies,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
soy, corn and cattle became king.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
And chicken soon joined them on the throne.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160
It was during this period that the cycle of

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
dietary and planetary destruction began,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
the thing we're only realizing just now.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
Listen to this,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.160
between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
Meat consumption increased five-fold.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:58.160
Now, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
And this took care of the situation resoundingly.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.160
Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.160
There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
because all of them could be bought at any store.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
Not that they were any good, but they were there.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
Most moms cooked like mine:

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.160
a piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
canned soup, canned fruit salad.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.160
Maybe baked or mashed potatoes,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.160
or perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.160
For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.160
My mom is not here, so I can say this now.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.160
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.160
(Laughter)

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.160
It wasn't all bad.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160
By the '70s, forward-thinking people

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160
began to recognize the value of local ingredients.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
we knew or we were vegetarians.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
We weren't all hippies, either.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.160
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.160
Meanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.160
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160
as if it were plastic,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.160
food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160
Many people became fat-phobic.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.160
Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160
But mostly they didn't eat broccoli.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.160
Instead they were sold on yogurt,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.160
yogurt being almost as good as broccoli.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.160
Except, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.160
was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
Similarly, let's look at a granola bar.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160
You think that that might be healthy food,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.160
but in fact, if you look at the ingredient list,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.160
it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.160
Sadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
if not actually killed --

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160
the beginning of the heyday of value-added food,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160
which contained as many soy and corn products

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
as could be crammed into it.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160
Think of the frozen chicken nugget.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.160
The chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.160
and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
and then it's fried in corn oil.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
All you do is nuke it. What could be better?

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
And zapped horribly, pathetically.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.160
By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
that the high fat and spice contents of foods

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160
like McNuggets and Hot Pockets --

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.160
and we all have our favorites, actually --

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.160
made this stuff more appealing than the bland things

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160
that people were serving at home.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.160
At the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
and cooking simply wasn't important enough

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
for men to share the burden.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.160
So now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
you've got your grazing nights,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
Leading the way -- what's leading the way?

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
Meat, junk food, cheese:

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
the very stuff that will kill you.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
So, now we clamor for organic food.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
That's good.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
And as evidence that things can actually change,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
you can now find organic food in supermarkets,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
and even in fast-food outlets.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
But organic food isn't the answer either,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
at least not the way it's currently defined.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
Let me pose you a question.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.160
Can farm-raised salmon be organic,

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:18.160
when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.160
even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.160
are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.160
And if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.160
and then flown 5,000 miles, whatever,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere?

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
I don't know.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
Packed in Styrofoam, of course,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.160
before landing somewhere in the United States,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.160
and then being trucked a few hundred more miles.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.160
This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
Now here is where we all meet.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
The locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.160
the vegans, the gourmets

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.160
and those of us who are just plain interested in good food.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.160
Even though we've come to this from different points,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160
we all have to act on our knowledge

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.160
to change the way that everyone thinks about food.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160
We need to start acting.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.160
And this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said --

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160
and, of course, she's completely right --

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
but it's also one of global survival.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.160
Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.160
the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.160
As I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.160
are attributed to livestock production.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.160
How much livestock do you need to produce this?

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.160
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:49.160
30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.160
to raising the animals we'll eat.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160
And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.160
And if the numbers coming in from China

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
are anything like what they look like now,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
it's not going to be 40 years.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.160
There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.160
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.160
The most common argument is that we need nutrients --

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.160
even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.160
as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.160
But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:32.160
recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.160
What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.160
But don't we need meat to be big and strong?

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.160
Isn't meat eating essential to health?

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.160
turn us into godless, sissy, liberals?

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.160
(Laughter)

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.160
Some of us might think that would be a good thing.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:56.160
But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.160
the answer is no.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.160
In fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.160
basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.160
and many will make you much healthier than ours does.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.160
We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:18.160
we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.160
To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.160
Americans eat 50 percent less meat --

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.160
it's not enough of a cut, but it's a start.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:32.160
It would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen,

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.160
and what progressive people, forward-thinking people

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.160
should be doing and advocating,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.160
along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.160
I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously --

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.160
one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.160
During that time, I've eaten

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.160
and recommended eating just about everything.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.160
I'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.160
but I do think that for the benefit of everyone,

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.160
the time has come to stop raising them industrially

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
and stop eating them thoughtlessly.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.160
Ann Cooper's right.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:11.160
The USDA is not our ally here.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.160
We have to take matters into our own hands,

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.160
not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone --

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.160
and that's the hard part -- but by improving our own.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.160
And that happens to be quite easy.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.160
Less meat, less junk, more plants.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.160
It's a simple formula: eat food.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.160
Eat real food.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.160
We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well,

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.160
and we can eat even better.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.160
We can continue the search for the ingredients we love,

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.160
and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.160
We'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.160
We can make food more important, not less,

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.160
and save ourselves by doing so.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.160
We have to choose that path.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.160
Thank you.
