00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:14.003
I used to think

00:00:14.027 --> 00:00:17.761
the whole purpose of life
was pursuing happiness.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.884
Everyone said the path
to happiness was success,

00:00:21.908 --> 00:00:24.406
so I searched for that ideal job,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.461
that perfect boyfriend,
that beautiful apartment.

00:00:28.818 --> 00:00:31.816
But instead of ever feeling fulfilled,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.444
I felt anxious and adrift.

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:39.024
And I wasn't alone; my friends --
they struggled with this, too.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.809
Eventually, I decided to go
to graduate school for positive psychology

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:48.053
to learn what truly makes people happy.

00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:51.447
But what I discovered there
changed my life.

00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:56.882
The data showed that chasing happiness
can make people unhappy.

00:00:57.787 --> 00:01:00.044
And what really struck me was this:

00:01:00.878 --> 00:01:03.665
the suicide rate has been rising
around the world,

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:06.780
and it recently reached
a 30-year high in America.

00:01:07.573 --> 00:01:10.336
Even though life is getting
objectively better

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.050
by nearly every conceivable standard,

00:01:13.074 --> 00:01:15.273
more people feel hopeless,

00:01:15.297 --> 00:01:17.422
depressed and alone.

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:20.847
There's an emptiness
gnawing away at people,

00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:24.141
and you don't have to be
clinically depressed to feel it.

00:01:24.165 --> 00:01:27.065
Sooner or later, I think we all wonder:

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:29.836
Is this all there is?

00:01:30.987 --> 00:01:34.193
And according to the research,
what predicts this despair

00:01:34.217 --> 00:01:36.044
is not a lack of happiness.

00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:37.910
It's a lack of something else,

00:01:38.637 --> 00:01:41.575
a lack of having meaning in life.

00:01:42.782 --> 00:01:45.175
But that raised some questions for me.

00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:48.274
Is there more to life than being happy?

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:51.459
And what's the difference
between being happy

00:01:51.483 --> 00:01:53.374
and having meaning in life?

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:59.299
Many psychologists define happiness
as a state of comfort and ease,

00:01:59.323 --> 00:02:01.212
feeling good in the moment.

00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:03.576
Meaning, though, is deeper.

00:02:04.098 --> 00:02:06.662
The renowned psychologist
Martin Seligman says

00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:11.333
meaning comes from belonging to
and serving something beyond yourself

00:02:11.357 --> 00:02:14.040
and from developing the best within you.

00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:18.032
Our culture is obsessed with happiness,

00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:22.163
but I came to see that seeking meaning
is the more fulfilling path.

00:02:22.187 --> 00:02:25.116
And the studies show that people
who have meaning in life,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.550
they're more resilient,

00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:29.131
they do better in school and at work,

00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:30.762
and they even live longer.

00:02:31.805 --> 00:02:33.826
So this all made me wonder:

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.324
How can we each live more meaningfully?

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.478
To find out, I spent five years
interviewing hundreds of people

00:02:41.502 --> 00:02:44.403
and reading through thousands
of pages of psychology,

00:02:44.427 --> 00:02:46.528
neuroscience and philosophy.

00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:48.975
Bringing it all together,

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:54.340
I found that there are what I call
four pillars of a meaningful life.

00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:56.798
And we can each create lives of meaning

00:02:56.822 --> 00:03:00.171
by building some or all
of these pillars in our lives.

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:03.436
The first pillar is belonging.

00:03:04.198 --> 00:03:06.505
Belonging comes
from being in relationships

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:09.234
where you're valued
for who you are intrinsically

00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:11.371
and where you value others as well.

00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:16.728
But some groups and relationships
deliver a cheap form of belonging;

00:03:16.752 --> 00:03:18.645
you're valued for what you believe,

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:19.915
for who you hate,

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:21.484
not for who you are.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.023
True belonging springs from love.

00:03:25.047 --> 00:03:28.032
It lives in moments among individuals,

00:03:28.056 --> 00:03:31.901
and it's a choice -- you can choose
to cultivate belonging with others.

00:03:32.481 --> 00:03:34.088
Here's an example.

00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:37.667
Each morning, my friend Jonathan
buys a newspaper

00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:39.909
from the same street vendor in New York.

00:03:40.322 --> 00:03:42.602
They don't just conduct
a transaction, though.

00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:45.309
They take a moment to slow down, talk,

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.239
and treat each other like humans.

00:03:47.858 --> 00:03:51.252
But one time, Jonathan
didn't have the right change,

00:03:51.276 --> 00:03:52.496
and the vendor said,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.040
"Don't worry about it."

00:03:54.064 --> 00:03:56.551
But Jonathan insisted on paying,

00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:59.587
so he went to the store
and bought something he didn't need

00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:01.072
to make change.

00:04:01.812 --> 00:04:04.435
But when he gave the money to the vendor,

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.981
the vendor drew back.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.918
He was hurt.

00:04:08.535 --> 00:04:10.384
He was trying to do something kind,

00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:12.655
but Jonathan had rejected him.

00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:18.084
I think we all reject people in small ways
like this without realizing it.

00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:19.306
I do.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.393
I'll walk by someone I know
and barely acknowledge them.

00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:25.064
I'll check my phone
when someone's talking to me.

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:27.427
These acts devalue others.

00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:30.204
They make them feel
invisible and unworthy.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.702
But when you lead with love,
you create a bond

00:04:33.726 --> 00:04:35.398
that lifts each of you up.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.478
For many people, belonging
is the most essential source of meaning,

00:04:40.502 --> 00:04:42.500
those bonds to family and friends.

00:04:42.996 --> 00:04:47.001
For others, the key to meaning
is the second pillar: purpose.

00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:50.579
Now, finding your purpose
is not the same thing

00:04:50.603 --> 00:04:52.851
as finding that job that makes you happy.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.799
Purpose is less about what you want
than about what you give.

00:04:56.823 --> 00:05:01.311
A hospital custodian told me
her purpose is healing sick people.

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:03.046
Many parents tell me,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.006
"My purpose is raising my children."

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:09.391
The key to purpose
is using your strengths to serve others.

00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:13.709
Of course, for many of us,
that happens through work.

00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:16.712
That's how we contribute and feel needed.

00:05:16.736 --> 00:05:20.596
But that also means
that issues like disengagement at work,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.033
unemployment,

00:05:22.057 --> 00:05:24.284
low labor force participation --

00:05:24.308 --> 00:05:27.999
these aren't just economic problems,
they're existential ones, too.

00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:30.854
Without something worthwhile to do,

00:05:30.878 --> 00:05:32.179
people flounder.

00:05:33.313 --> 00:05:35.929
Of course, you don't have to find
purpose at work,

00:05:35.953 --> 00:05:38.682
but purpose gives you
something to live for,

00:05:38.706 --> 00:05:40.786
some "why" that drives you forward.

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:46.267
The third pillar of meaning
is also about stepping beyond yourself,

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:48.133
but in a completely different way:

00:05:48.157 --> 00:05:49.744
transcendence.

00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:52.145
Transcendent states are those rare moments

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.581
when you're lifted above
the hustle and bustle of daily life,

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.310
your sense of self fades away,

00:05:57.334 --> 00:06:00.108
and you feel connected
to a higher reality.

00:06:01.034 --> 00:06:04.724
For one person I talked to,
transcendence came from seeing art.

00:06:04.748 --> 00:06:07.278
For another person, it was at church.

00:06:07.302 --> 00:06:10.856
For me, I'm a writer,
and it happens through writing.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.950
Sometimes I get so in the zone
that I lose all sense of time and place.

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:19.723
These transcendent
experiences can change you.

00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:24.271
One study had students look up
at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees

00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:25.496
for one minute.

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:28.237
But afterwards
they felt less self-centered,

00:06:28.261 --> 00:06:30.205
and they even behaved more generously

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.299
when given the chance to help someone.

00:06:33.402 --> 00:06:37.122
Belonging, purpose, transcendence.

00:06:38.194 --> 00:06:40.917
Now, the fourth pillar
of meaning, I've found,

00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:42.696
tends to surprise people.

00:06:43.186 --> 00:06:45.920
The fourth pillar is storytelling,

00:06:45.944 --> 00:06:48.809
the story you tell yourself
about yourself.

00:06:49.436 --> 00:06:53.580
Creating a narrative from the events
of your life brings clarity.

00:06:53.604 --> 00:06:56.640
It helps you understand
how you became you.

00:06:57.489 --> 00:07:00.585
But we don't always realize
that we're the authors of our stories

00:07:00.609 --> 00:07:02.772
and can change the way we're telling them.

00:07:02.796 --> 00:07:05.287
Your life isn't just a list of events.

00:07:05.311 --> 00:07:08.527
You can edit, interpret
and retell your story,

00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:10.771
even as you're constrained by the facts.

00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:16.129
I met a young man named Emeka,
who'd been paralyzed playing football.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.199
After his injury, Emeka told himself,

00:07:19.223 --> 00:07:21.928
"My life was great playing football,

00:07:21.952 --> 00:07:24.076
but now look at me."

00:07:25.822 --> 00:07:28.114
People who tell stories like this --

00:07:28.138 --> 00:07:30.662
"My life was good. Now it's bad." --

00:07:30.686 --> 00:07:33.508
tend to be more anxious and depressed.

00:07:33.532 --> 00:07:35.861
And that was Emeka for a while.

00:07:36.393 --> 00:07:39.784
But with time, he started
to weave a different story.

00:07:40.235 --> 00:07:41.968
His new story was,

00:07:41.992 --> 00:07:45.259
"Before my injury,
my life was purposeless.

00:07:45.283 --> 00:07:48.536
I partied a lot and was
a pretty selfish guy.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.268
But my injury made me realize
I could be a better man."

00:07:53.308 --> 00:07:56.849
That edit to his story
changed Emeka's life.

00:07:56.873 --> 00:07:59.304
After telling the new story to himself,

00:07:59.328 --> 00:08:01.250
Emeka started mentoring kids,

00:08:01.274 --> 00:08:03.640
and he discovered what his purpose was:

00:08:03.664 --> 00:08:05.054
serving others.

00:08:05.921 --> 00:08:09.299
The psychologist Dan McAdams
calls this a "redemptive story,"

00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:11.606
where the bad is redeemed by the good.

00:08:12.447 --> 00:08:14.630
People leading meaningful
lives, he's found,

00:08:14.654 --> 00:08:16.585
tend to tell stories about their lives

00:08:16.609 --> 00:08:19.631
defined by redemption, growth and love.

00:08:20.543 --> 00:08:23.005
But what makes people
change their stories?

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.473
Some people get help from a therapist,

00:08:25.497 --> 00:08:27.307
but you can do it on your own, too,

00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:30.091
just by reflecting
on your life thoughtfully,

00:08:30.115 --> 00:08:32.202
how your defining experiences shaped you,

00:08:32.226 --> 00:08:33.963
what you lost, what you gained.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:35.943
That's what Emeka did.

00:08:36.832 --> 00:08:38.878
You won't change your story overnight;

00:08:38.902 --> 00:08:41.247
it could take years and be painful.

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:44.205
After all, we've all suffered,
and we all struggle.

00:08:44.777 --> 00:08:49.116
But embracing those painful memories
can lead to new insights and wisdom,

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.205
to finding that good that sustains you.

00:08:54.404 --> 00:08:58.937
Belonging, purpose,
transcendence, storytelling:

00:08:59.683 --> 00:09:02.414
those are the four pillars of meaning.

00:09:03.446 --> 00:09:05.052
When I was younger,

00:09:05.076 --> 00:09:08.714
I was lucky enough to be surrounded
by all of the pillars.

00:09:09.201 --> 00:09:13.741
My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse
from our home in Montreal.

00:09:14.506 --> 00:09:18.989
Sufism is a spiritual practice
associated with the whirling dervishes

00:09:19.013 --> 00:09:20.406
and the poet Rumi.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.825
Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home

00:09:23.849 --> 00:09:27.609
to meditate, drink Persian tea,
and share stories.

00:09:28.029 --> 00:09:30.986
Their practice also involved
serving all of creation

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.820
through small acts of love,

00:09:32.844 --> 00:09:36.185
which meant being kind
even when people wronged you.

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:39.363
But it gave them a purpose:
to rein in the ego.

00:09:40.732 --> 00:09:43.348
Eventually, I left home for college

00:09:43.372 --> 00:09:47.074
and without the daily grounding
of Sufism in my life,

00:09:47.098 --> 00:09:48.686
I felt unmoored.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.298
And I started searching for those things
that make life worth living.

00:09:52.322 --> 00:09:54.435
That's what set me on this journey.

00:09:54.832 --> 00:09:56.589
Looking back, I now realize

00:09:56.613 --> 00:09:59.855
that the Sufi house
had a real culture of meaning.

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:02.385
The pillars were part of the architecture,

00:10:02.409 --> 00:10:05.635
and the presence of the pillars
helped us all live more deeply.

00:10:06.234 --> 00:10:08.555
Of course, the same principle applies

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:10.780
in other strong communities as well --

00:10:10.804 --> 00:10:12.826
good ones and bad ones.

00:10:13.376 --> 00:10:15.405
Gangs, cults:

00:10:15.429 --> 00:10:18.442
these are cultures of meaning
that use the pillars

00:10:18.466 --> 00:10:21.844
and give people
something to live and die for.

00:10:21.868 --> 00:10:24.735
But that's exactly why we as a society

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:26.868
must offer better alternatives.

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:30.643
We need to build these pillars
within our families and our institutions

00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:33.249
to help people become their best selves.

00:10:34.344 --> 00:10:36.930
But living a meaningful life takes work.

00:10:36.954 --> 00:10:38.829
It's an ongoing process.

00:10:38.853 --> 00:10:42.582
As each day goes by,
we're constantly creating our lives,

00:10:42.606 --> 00:10:44.175
adding to our story.

00:10:44.651 --> 00:10:47.400
And sometimes we can get off track.

00:10:48.182 --> 00:10:50.093
Whenever that happens to me,

00:10:50.117 --> 00:10:53.506
I remember a powerful experience
I had with my father.

00:10:55.641 --> 00:10:58.288
Several months after
I graduated from college,

00:10:58.312 --> 00:11:02.170
my dad had a massive heart attack
that should have killed him.

00:11:02.853 --> 00:11:06.067
He survived, and when I asked him
what was going through his mind

00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:07.713
as he faced death,

00:11:07.737 --> 00:11:10.420
he said all he could think about
was needing to live

00:11:10.444 --> 00:11:12.582
so he could be there
for my brother and me,

00:11:12.606 --> 00:11:15.195
and this gave him the will
to fight for life.

00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:19.181
When he went under anesthesia
for emergency surgery,

00:11:19.205 --> 00:11:21.535
instead of counting backwards from 10,

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:24.729
he repeated our names like a mantra.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:29.421
He wanted our names to be
the last words he spoke on earth

00:11:29.445 --> 00:11:30.670
if he died.

00:11:32.853 --> 00:11:36.465
My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi.

00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:38.552
It's a humble life,

00:11:38.576 --> 00:11:39.845
but a good life.

00:11:40.384 --> 00:11:44.296
Lying there facing death,
he had a reason to live:

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.728
love.

00:11:45.752 --> 00:11:48.203
His sense of belonging within his family,

00:11:48.227 --> 00:11:49.956
his purpose as a dad,

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.994
his transcendent meditation,
repeating our names --

00:11:53.018 --> 00:11:55.799
these, he says, are the reasons
why he survived.

00:11:55.823 --> 00:11:58.262
That's the story he tells himself.

00:11:59.567 --> 00:12:01.717
That's the power of meaning.

00:12:02.463 --> 00:12:05.255
Happiness comes and goes.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:07.128
But when life is really good

00:12:07.152 --> 00:12:09.041
and when things are really bad,

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:12.114
having meaning gives you
something to hold on to.

00:12:12.142 --> 00:12:13.366
Thank you.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.972
