00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Thank you so much. I'm going to try to take you

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
on a journey of the underwater acoustic world

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
of whales and dolphins.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Since we are such a visual species,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
it's hard for us to really understand this,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
so I'll use a mixture of figures and sounds

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
and hope this can communicate it.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
But let's also think, as a visual species,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
what it's like when we go snorkeling or diving

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and try to look underwater.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
We really can't see very far.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Our vision, which works so well in air,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
And what marine mammals have evolved

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
over the last tens of millions of years

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
is ways to depend on sound

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
to both explore their world

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
and also to stay in touch with one another.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
They can produce loud clicks

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
They can listen for echoes from prey

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
in order to decide where food is

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
and to decide which one they want to eat.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
All marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
So the large baleen whales

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
will produce long, beautiful songs,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
which are used in reproductive advertisement

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
for male and females, both to find one another

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and to select a mate.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
And mother and young and closely bonded animals

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
use calls to stay in touch with one another,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
so sound is really critical for their lives.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
The first thing that got me interested in the sounds

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
of these underwater animals,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
whose world was so foreign to me,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
was evidence from captive dolphins

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
And I mentioned I'll use

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
some visual representations of sounds.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Here's the first example.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
This is a plot of frequency against time --

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
sort of like musical notation,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and time goes this way.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
This is a picture of a trainer's whistle,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
it's done the right thing and can come get a fish.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
It sounds sort of like "tweeeeeet." Like that.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
This is a calf in captivity

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
making an imitation

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
of that trainer's whistle.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
If you hummed this tune to your dog or cat

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
and it hummed it back to you,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
you ought to be pretty surprised.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Very few nonhuman mammals

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
can imitate sounds.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
It's really important for our music and our language.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
So it's a puzzle: The few other mammal groups that do this,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
why do they do it?

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
A lot of my career has been devoted

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
to trying to understand

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
how these animals use their learning,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
use the ability to change what you say

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
based on what you hear

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
in their own communication systems.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
So let's start with calls of a nonhuman primate.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Many mammals have to produce contact calls

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
when, say, a mother and calf are apart.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
This is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
when they're isolated from another one.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And you can see, there's not much

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
variability in these calls.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
By contrast, the signature whistle

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
which dolphins use to stay in touch,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
each individual here has a radically different call.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
They can use this ability to learn calls

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
to identify individuals.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
How about the setting in which animals need to use this call?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Well let's look at mothers and calves.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
In normal life for mother and calf dolphin,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
they'll often drift apart or swim apart if Mom is chasing a fish,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
and when they separate

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
they have to get back together again.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
in which dolphins whistle,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
against the maximum distance.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
So when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
less than half the time they need to use whistles.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Most of the time they can just find each other

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
just by swimming around.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
But all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
they need to use these individually distinctive whistles

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
to come back together again.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Most of these distinctive signature whistles

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
are quite stereotyped and stable

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
through the life of a dolphin.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
But there are some exceptions.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
When a male dolphin leaves Mom,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
it will often join up with another male

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and form an alliance, which may last for decades.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
As these two animals form a social bond,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
their distinctive whistles actually converge

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
and become very similar.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
This plot shows two members of a pair.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
As you can see at the top here,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
they share an up-sweep, like "woop, woop, woop."

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
They both have that kind of up-sweep.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
Whereas these members of a pair go "wo-ot, wo-ot, wo-ot."

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And what's happened is

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
they've used this learning process

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
It's a very interesting way that they can

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
form a new identifier

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
for the new social group that they've had.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Let's now take a step back

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
and see what this message can tell us

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
about protecting dolphins

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
from human disturbance.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Anybody looking at this picture

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
will know this dolphin is surrounded,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and clearly his behavior is being disrupted.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
This is a bad situation.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
But it turns out that when just a single boat

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
is approaching a group of dolphins

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
at a couple hundred meters away,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
the dolphins will start whistling,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
they'll change what they're doing, they'll have a more cohesive group,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
wait for the boat to go by,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and then they'll get back to normal business.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Well, in a place like Sarasota, Florida,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
the average interval between times

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
is six minutes.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
So even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
it's still affecting the amount of time these animals have

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
to do their normal work.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And if we look at a very pristine environment like western Australia,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Lars Bider has done work

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
comparing dolphin behavior and distribution

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
before there were dolphin-watching boats.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
When there was one boat, not much of an impact.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And two boats: When the second boat was added,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
what happened was that some of the dolphins

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
left the area completely.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
Of the ones that stayed, their reproductive rate declined.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
So it could have a negative impact on the whole population.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
When we think of marine-protected areas for animals like dolphins,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
this means that we have to be

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
We may need to regulate the intensity

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
of recreational boating and actual whale watching

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
in order to prevent these kinds of problems.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
I'd also like to point out that sound

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
doesn't obey boundaries.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
So you can draw a line to try to protect an area,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
but chemical pollution and noise pollution

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
will continue to move through the area.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
And I'd like to switch now from this local,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
familiar, coastal environment

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
to a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
This is a kind of map we've all been looking at.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
The world is mostly blue.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
But I'd also like to point out that the oceans

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
are much more connected than we think.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
Notice how few barriers there are to movement

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
across all of the oceans compared to land.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
To me, the most mind-bending example

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
of the interconnectedness of the ocean

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
comes from an acoustic experiment

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
where oceanographers

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
took a ship to the southern Indian Ocean,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
deployed an underwater loudspeaker

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and played back a sound.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
That same sound

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
traveled to the west, and could be heard in Bermuda,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and traveled to the east, and could be heard in Monterey --

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
the same sound.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
So we live in a world of satellite communication,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
are used to global communication,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
but it's still amazing to me.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
The ocean has properties

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
that allow low-frequency sound

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
to basically move globally.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
The acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
It's nearly halfway around the globe.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
In the early '70s,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Roger Payne and an ocean acoustician

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
published a theoretical paper

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
pointing out that it was possible

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that sound could transmit over these large areas,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
but very few biologists believed it.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
It actually turns out, though,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
even though we've only known of long-range propagation for a few decades,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
the whales clearly have evolved,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
over tens of millions of years,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
So blue whales and fin whales

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
produce very low-frequency sounds

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
that can travel over very long ranges.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
The top plot here shows

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
a complicated series of calls

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
that are repeated by males.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
They form songs, and they appear to play a role in reproduction,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
sort of like that of song birds.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Down below here, we see calls made by both males and females

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
that also carry over very long ranges.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
The biologists continued to be skeptical

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
of the long-range communication issue

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
well past the '70s,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
until the end of the Cold War.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
What happened was, during the Cold War,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
the U.S. Navy had a system that was secret at the time,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
that they used to track Russian submarines.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
It had deep underwater microphones, or hydrophones,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
cabled to shore,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
all wired back to a central place that could listen

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
to sounds over the whole North Atlantic.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
And after the Berlin Wall fell, the Navy made these systems available

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
to whale bio-acousticians

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
to see what they could hear.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
This is a plot from Christopher Clark

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
who tracked one individual blue whale

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
as it passed by Bermuda,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
went down to the latitude of Miami and came back again.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
It was tracked for 43 days,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
swimming 1,700 kilometers,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
or more than 1,000 miles.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
This shows us both that the calls

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
are detectable over hundreds of miles

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
They're ocean-based and scale animals

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
who are communicating over much longer ranges

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
than we had anticipated.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Unlike fins and blues, which

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
the humpbacked whales congregate

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
in local traditional breeding grounds,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
so they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
broader-band and more complicated.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
So you're listening to the complicated song

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
produced by humpbacks here.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Humpbacks, when they develop

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
the ability to sing this song,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
they're listening to other whales

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
and modifying what they sing based on what they're hearing,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
just like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
This means that humpback song

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
is a form of animal culture,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
just like music for humans would be.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
I think one of the most interesting examples of this

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
comes from Australia.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Biologists on the east coast of Australia

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
were recording the songs of humpbacks in that area.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And this orange line here marks the typical songs

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
of east coast humpbacks.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
In '95 they all sang the normal song.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
But in '96 they heard a few weird songs,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and it turned out that these strange songs

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
were typical of west coast whales.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
The west coast calls became more and more popular,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
until by 1998,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
none of the whales sang the east coast song; it was completely gone.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
They just sang the cool new west coast song.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
It's as if some new hit style

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
had completely wiped out

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
the old-fashioned style before,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and with no golden oldies stations.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
Nobody sang the old ones.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
I'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Now you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clark,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
0.2 miles away from a humpback.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
You can hear the full frequency range. It's quite loud.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
You sound very nearby.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
The next recording you're going to hear

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
was made of the same humpback song

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
50 miles away.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
That's shown down here.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
You only hear the low frequencies.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
You hear the reverberation

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
as the sound travels over long-range in the ocean

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
and is not quite as loud.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
Now after I play back these humpback calls,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
I'll play blue whale calls, but they have to be sped up

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
because they're so low in frequency

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
that you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Here's a blue whale call at 50 miles,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
which was distant for the humpback.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
It's loud, clear -- you can hear it very clearly.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
Here's the same call recorded from a hydrophone

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
500 miles away.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
There's a lot of noise, which is mostly other whales.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
But you can still hear that faint call.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
Let's now switch and think about

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
a potential for human impacts.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
The most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
comes from shipping.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
This is the sound of a ship,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
and I'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Imagine that whale listening from 500 miles.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
There's a potential problem that maybe

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
from being able to hear each other.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Now this is something that's been known for quite a while.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
This is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
And on the y-axis

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
is the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
by frequency.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
In the low frequencies, this line indicates

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Up high, these variable lines

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
indicate increasing noise in this frequency range

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
from higher wind and wave.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
But right in the middle here where there's a sweet spot,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
the noise is dominated by human ships.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
Now think about it. This is an amazing thing:

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
That in this frequency range where whales communicate,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
the main source globally, on our planet, for the noise

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
comes from human ships,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
thousands of human ships, distant, far away,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
just all aggregating.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
The next slide will show what the impact this may have

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
on the range at which whales can communicate.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
So here we have the loudness of a call at the whale.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
And as we get farther away,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
the sound gets fainter and fainter.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
Now in the pre-industrial ocean, as we were mentioning,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
this whale call could be easily detected.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
It's louder than noise

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
at a range of a thousand kilometers.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Let's now take that additional increase in noise

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
that we saw comes from shipping.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
All of a sudden, the effective range of communication

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
goes from a thousand kilometers to 10 kilometers.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
Now if this signal is used for males and females

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
to find each other for mating and they're dispersed,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
imagine the impact this could have

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
on the recovery of endangered populations.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
Whales also have contact calls

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
like I described for the dolphins.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
I'll play the sound of a contact call used

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
by right whales to stay in touch.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
And this is the kind of call that is used by,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
say, right whale mothers and calves

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
as they separate to come back again.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Now imagine -- let's put the ship noise in the picture.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
What's a mother to do

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
if the ship comes by and her calf isn't there?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
I'll describe a couple strategies.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
One strategy is if your call's down here,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
and the noise is in this band,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
and communicate better.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Susan Parks of Penn State has actually studied this.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
She's looked in the Atlantic. Here's data from the South Atlantic.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
Here's a typical South Atlantic contact call from the '70s.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
Look what happened by 2000 to the average call.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
Same thing in the North Atlantic,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
in the '50s versus 2000.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Over the last 50 years,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
as we've put more noise into the oceans,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
these whales have had to shift.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
It's as if the whole population had to shift

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
from being basses to singing as a tenor.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
It's an amazing shift, induced by humans

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
over this large scale,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
in both time and space.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
And we now know that whales can compensate for noise

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
by calling louder, like I did when that ship was playing,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
by waiting for silence

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
and by shifting their call out of the noise band.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Now there's probably costs to calling louder

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
and there's probably lost opportunities.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
If we also have to wait for silence,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
So we have to be very concerned

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
about when the noise in habitats

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
degrades the habitat enough

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
or are not able to perform critical functions.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
It's a really important problem.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
And I'm happy to say that there are several

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
very promising developments in this area,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
looking at the impact of shipping on whales.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
In terms of the shipping noise,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
the International Maritime Organization of the United Nations

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
has formed a group whose job is to establish

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
guidelines for quieting ships,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
to tell the industry how you could quiet ships.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
And they've already found

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
that by being more intelligent about better propeller design,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
you can reduce that noise by 90 percent.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
If you actually insulate and isolate

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
the machinery of the ship from the hull,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
you can reduce that noise by 99 percent.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
So at this point, it's primarily an issue of cost and standards.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
If this group can establish standards,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
we can now see a gradual decline

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
in this potential problem.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
But there's also another problem from ships that I'm illustrating here,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
and that's the problem of collision.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
This is a whale that just squeaked by

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
But collision is a serious problem.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
Endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
and it's very important to try to reduce this.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
I'll discuss two very promising approaches.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
The first case comes from the Bay of Fundy.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
These black lines mark shipping lanes

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
in and out of the Bay of Fundy.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
The colorized area

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
because of the ships moving in this lane.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
It turns out that this lane here

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
Well, biologists

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
who couldn't take no for an answer

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
went to the International Maritime Organization

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
and petitioned them to say,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
"Can't you move that lane? Those are just lines on the ground.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
Can't you move them over to a place

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
where there's less of a risk?"

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
And the International Maritime Organization responded very strongly,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
"These are the new lanes."

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
The shipping lanes have been moved.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
And as you can see, the risk of collision is much lower.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
So it's very promising, actually.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
We can be very creative about thinking

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
of different ways to reduce these risks.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
Another action which was just taken independently

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
by a shipping company itself

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
was initiated because of concerns the shipping company had

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
about greenhouse gas emissions with global warming.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
The Maersk Line looked at their competition

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
and saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
They rush as fast as they can to get to their port.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
But then they often wait there.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
What Maersk did is they worked ways to slow down.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
They could slow down by about 50 percent.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
This reduced their fuel consumption by about 30 percent,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
which saved them money,

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.260
and at the same time, it had a significant benefit for whales.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
It you slow down, you reduce the amount of noise you make

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
and you reduce the risk of collision.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
So to conclude, I'd just like to point out,

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
you know, the whales live in

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
an amazing acoustic environment.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
They've evolved over tens of millions of years

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
to take advantage of this.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.260
And we need to be very attentive and vigilant

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
to thinking about where things that we do

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
may unintentionally prevent them

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.260
from being able to achieve their important activities.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
At the same time, we need to be really creative

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
I hope these examples have shown

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
some of the different directions we can take

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
in addition to protected areas

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260
