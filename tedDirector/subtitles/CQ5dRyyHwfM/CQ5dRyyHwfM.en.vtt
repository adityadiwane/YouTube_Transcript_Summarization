00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:14.844
Well, now we're going to the Bahamas to meet

00:00:14.844 --> 00:00:17.087
a remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with

00:00:17.087 --> 00:00:20.554
in the wild for the last 28 years.

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:23.749
Now I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:25.863
and what they might be doing with all that brainpower

00:00:25.863 --> 00:00:27.338
in the wild.

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:29.610
And we know they use some of that brainpower

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.774
for just living complicated lives,

00:00:31.774 --> 00:00:34.634
but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence?

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.338
Well, we know a few things.

00:00:36.338 --> 00:00:38.527
We know that their brain-to-body ratio,

00:00:38.527 --> 00:00:40.497
which is a physical measure of intelligence,

00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:42.993
is second only to humans.

00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:44.551
Cognitively, they can understand

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:46.980
artificially-created languages.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.121
And they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors.

00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:52.225
And in some parts of the world, they use tools,

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:54.540
like sponges to hunt fish.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.191
But there's one big question left:

00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:59.058
do they have a language, and if so,

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:01.462
what are they talking about?

00:01:01.462 --> 00:01:04.905
So decades ago, not years ago,

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:07.068
I set out to find a place in the world

00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:08.866
where I could observe dolphins underwater

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:12.109
to try to crack the code of their communication system.

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:14.723
Now in most parts of the world, the water's pretty murky,

00:01:14.723 --> 00:01:17.962
so it's very hard to observe animals underwater,

00:01:17.962 --> 00:01:19.721
but I found a community of dolphins that live

00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:22.747
in these beautiful, clear, shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas

00:01:22.747 --> 00:01:24.989
which are just east of Florida.

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:27.400
And they spend their daytime resting and socializing

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.270
in the safety of the shallows, but at night,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.069
they go off the edge and hunt in deep water.

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.893
Now, it's not a bad place to be a researcher, either.

00:01:36.893 --> 00:01:39.069
So we go out for about five months every summer

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.271
in a 20-meter catamaran, and we live, sleep and work

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:45.349
at sea for weeks at a time.

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.989
My main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone,

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:49.939
which is an underwater microphone, and this is so

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.033
I can correlate sound and behavior.

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:53.679
And most of our work's pretty non-invasive.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.501
We try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water,

00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:59.629
since we're actually observing them physically in the water.

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:02.769
Now, Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.733
to work with for a couple of reasons.

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:07.664
They're born without spots, and they get spots with age,

00:02:07.664 --> 00:02:10.698
and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases,

00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:12.640
so that's fun to track their behavior.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.093
And by about the age of 15, they're fully spotted black and white.

00:02:16.093 --> 00:02:18.516
Now the mother you see here is Mugsy.

00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:20.501
She's 35 years old in this shot,

00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:23.691
but dolphins can actually live into their early 50s.

00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:26.994
And like all the dolphins in our community,

00:02:26.994 --> 00:02:29.765
we photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:31.507
and nicks in her dorsal fin,

00:02:31.507 --> 00:02:33.710
and also the unique spot patterns

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.053
as she matured over time.

00:02:36.053 --> 00:02:38.712
Now, young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up,

00:02:38.712 --> 00:02:41.787
and they use their teenage years to practice social skills,

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:44.140
and at about the age of nine, the females

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.810
become sexually mature, so they can get pregnant,

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.781
and the males mature quite a bit later,

00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:50.896
at around 15 years of age.

00:02:50.896 --> 00:02:52.636
And dolphins are very promiscuous,

00:02:52.636 --> 00:02:55.498
and so we have to determine who the fathers are,

00:02:55.498 --> 00:02:57.952
so we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material

00:02:57.952 --> 00:03:00.816
out of the water and extracting DNA.

00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:03.280
So what that means is, after 28 years,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.688
we are tracking three generations,

00:03:05.688 --> 00:03:08.032
including grandmothers and grandfathers.

00:03:08.032 --> 00:03:10.648
Now, dolphins are natural acousticians.

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:12.932
They make sounds 10 times as high

00:03:12.932 --> 00:03:15.120
and hear sounds 10 times as high as we do.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.715
But they have other communication signals they use.

00:03:17.715 --> 00:03:21.056
They have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate.

00:03:21.056 --> 00:03:23.256
They have taste, not smell.

00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:25.296
And they have touch.

00:03:25.296 --> 00:03:27.492
And sound can actually be felt in the water,

00:03:27.492 --> 00:03:30.523
because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same.

00:03:30.523 --> 00:03:34.153
So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance.

00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:36.693
Now, we do know some things about how sounds are used

00:03:36.693 --> 00:03:38.102
with certain behaviors.

00:03:38.102 --> 00:03:40.201
Now, the signature whistle is a whistle

00:03:40.201 --> 00:03:44.900
that's specific to an individual dolphin, and it's like a name. (Dolphin whistling noises)

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.076
And this is the best-studied sound,

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:48.705
because it's easy to measure, really,

00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:50.662
and you'd find this whistle when mothers and calves

00:03:50.662 --> 00:03:52.799
are reuniting, for example.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.857
Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks.

00:03:55.857 --> 00:03:59.103
This is the dolphin's sonar. (Dolphin echolocation noises)

00:03:59.103 --> 00:04:02.420
And they use these clicks to hunt and feed.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.808
But they can also tightly pack these clicks together

00:04:04.808 --> 00:04:06.943
into buzzes and use them socially.

00:04:06.943 --> 00:04:08.921
For example, males will stimulate a female

00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:11.425
during a courtship chase.

00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:13.752
You know, I've been buzzed in the water.

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:15.684
(Laughter)

00:04:15.684 --> 00:04:18.065
Don't tell anyone. It's a secret.

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:20.361
And you can really feel the sound. That was my point with that.

00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:24.093
(Laughter)

00:04:24.093 --> 00:04:26.618
So dolphins are also political animals,

00:04:26.618 --> 00:04:28.929
so they have to resolve conflicts.

00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:30.572
(Dolphin noises)

00:04:30.572 --> 00:04:32.945
And they use these burst-pulsed sounds as well as

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:35.353
their head-to-head behaviors when they're fighting.

00:04:35.353 --> 00:04:37.425
And these are very unstudied sounds

00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:39.563
because they're hard to measure.

00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:42.282
Now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.303
(Dolphin noises)

00:04:44.303 --> 00:04:46.393
So you're going to see two groups,

00:04:46.393 --> 00:04:48.601
and you're going to see the head-to-head posturing,

00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:51.945
some open mouths,

00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:54.101
lots of squawking.

00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:57.686
There's a bubble.

00:04:57.686 --> 00:05:00.269
And basically, one of these groups will kind of back off

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:01.923
and everything will resolve fine,

00:05:01.923 --> 00:05:05.583
and it doesn't really escalate into violence too much.

00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:07.887
Now, in the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose

00:05:07.887 --> 00:05:10.831
that interact socially with the spotted dolphins.

00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:13.542
For example, they babysit each other's calves.

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:15.719
The males have dominance displays that they use

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.119
when they're chasing each other's females.

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:20.541
And the two species actually form temporary alliances

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:22.919
when they're chasing sharks away.

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.830
And one of the mechanisms they use to communicate

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.830
their coordination is synchrony.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.941
They synchronize their sounds and their body postures

00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:33.075
to look bigger and sound stronger.

00:05:33.075 --> 00:05:34.551
(Dolphins noises)

00:05:34.551 --> 00:05:37.143
Now, these are bottlenose dolphins,

00:05:37.143 --> 00:05:38.914
and you'll see them starting to synchronize

00:05:38.914 --> 00:05:40.815
their behavior and their sounds.

00:05:40.815 --> 00:05:45.183
(Dolphin noises)

00:05:45.183 --> 00:05:47.429
You see, they're synchronizing with their partner

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:51.401
as well as the other dyad.

00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:53.915
I wish I was that coordinated.

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.805
Now, it's important to remember that you're only hearing

00:05:59.805 --> 00:06:01.700
the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.863
and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds,

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.421
and we use special equipment in the water

00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:07.158
to collect these sounds.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.723
Now, researchers have actually measured whistle complexity

00:06:09.723 --> 00:06:11.786
using information theory,

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:15.677
and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages.

00:06:15.677 --> 00:06:19.529
But burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery.

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.616
Now, these are three spectragrams.

00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:25.291
Two are human words, and one is a dolphin vocalizing.

00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:29.163
So just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.743
Now, it turns out burst-pulsed sounds actually look

00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:36.247
a bit like human phonemes.

00:06:36.247 --> 00:06:37.513
Now, one way to crack the code

00:06:37.513 --> 00:06:40.058
is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean,

00:06:40.058 --> 00:06:44.056
but it's a difficult job, and we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet.

00:06:44.056 --> 00:06:46.178
But a second way to crack the code

00:06:46.178 --> 00:06:48.143
is to develop some technology,

00:06:48.143 --> 00:06:50.323
an interface to do two-way communication,

00:06:50.323 --> 00:06:52.687
and that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas

00:06:52.687 --> 00:06:55.127
and in real time.

00:06:55.127 --> 00:06:57.783
Now, scientists have used keyboard interfaces

00:06:57.783 --> 00:06:59.847
to try to bridge the gap with species

00:06:59.847 --> 00:07:01.935
including chimpanzees and dolphins.

00:07:01.935 --> 00:07:04.960
This underwater keyboard in Orlando, Florida,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.702
at the Epcot Center, was actually

00:07:06.702 --> 00:07:09.519
the most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:12.383
for humans and dolphins to work together under the water

00:07:12.383 --> 00:07:14.310
and exchange information.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.930
So we wanted to develop an interface like this

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.300
in the Bahamas, but in a more natural setting.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.467
And one of the reasons we thought we could do this

00:07:21.467 --> 00:07:23.489
is because the dolphins were starting to show us

00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:25.093
a lot of mutual curiosity.

00:07:25.093 --> 00:07:28.004
They were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations

00:07:28.004 --> 00:07:30.324
and our postures, and they were also inviting us

00:07:30.324 --> 00:07:32.957
into dolphin games.

00:07:32.957 --> 00:07:35.604
Now, dolphins are social mammals, so they love to play,

00:07:35.604 --> 00:07:38.924
and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed,

00:07:38.924 --> 00:07:42.036
or sargassum in this case, around.

00:07:42.036 --> 00:07:44.172
And they're very adept. They like to drag it

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:48.492
and drop it from appendage to appendage.

00:07:48.492 --> 00:07:51.188
Now in this footage, the adult is Caroh.

00:07:51.188 --> 00:07:55.060
She's 25 years old here, and this is her newborn, Cobalt,

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.744
and he's just learning how to play this game.

00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:59.470
(Dolphin noises)

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.940
She's kind of teasing him and taunting him.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.369
He really wants that sargassum.

00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:11.280
Now, when dolphins solicit humans for this game,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.331
they'll often sink vertically in the water,

00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:16.760
and they'll have a little sargassum on their flipper,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.379
and they'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:20.913
on the bottom and let us go get it,

00:08:20.913 --> 00:08:23.129
and then we'll have a little seaweed keep away game.

00:08:23.129 --> 00:08:24.965
But when we don't dive down and get it,

00:08:24.965 --> 00:08:26.938
they'll bring it to the surface

00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:30.112
and they'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail

00:08:30.112 --> 00:08:32.198
and drop it for us like they do their calves,

00:08:32.198 --> 00:08:34.400
and then we'll pick it up and have a game.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.750
And so we started thinking, well, wouldn't it be neat

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.568
to build some technology that would allow the dolphins

00:08:39.568 --> 00:08:42.843
to request these things in real time, their favorite toys?

00:08:42.843 --> 00:08:45.213
So the original vision was to have a keyboard

00:08:45.213 --> 00:08:47.386
hanging from the boat attached to a computer,

00:08:47.386 --> 00:08:49.901
and the divers and dolphins would activate the keys

00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:52.791
on the keypad and happily exchange information

00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:54.949
and request toys from each other.

00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:56.743
But we quickly found out that dolphins simply

00:08:56.743 --> 00:08:59.869
were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard.

00:08:59.869 --> 00:09:02.005
They've got better things to do in the wild.

00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:04.269
They might do it in captivity, but in the wild --

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:06.994
So we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water,

00:09:06.994 --> 00:09:09.734
and we labeled four objects they like to play with,

00:09:09.734 --> 00:09:12.675
the scarf, rope, sargassum, and also had a bow ride,

00:09:12.675 --> 00:09:14.786
which is a fun activity for a dolphin. (Whistle)

00:09:14.786 --> 00:09:16.629
And that's the scarf whistle,

00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:19.547
which is also associated with a visual symbol.

00:09:19.547 --> 00:09:21.841
And these are artificially created whistles.

00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:24.469
They're outside the dolphin's normal repertoire,

00:09:24.469 --> 00:09:26.889
but they're easily mimicked by the dolphins.

00:09:26.889 --> 00:09:31.068
And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour,

00:09:31.068 --> 00:09:33.289
working out in the field with this keyboard

00:09:33.289 --> 00:09:35.933
using it with each other to do requests for toys

00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:37.592
while the dolphins were watching.

00:09:37.592 --> 00:09:38.959
And the dolphins could get in on the game.

00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:40.894
They could point at the visual object,

00:09:40.894 --> 00:09:43.368
or they could mimic the whistle.

00:09:43.368 --> 00:09:46.736
Now this is video of a session.

00:09:46.736 --> 00:09:48.937
The diver here has a rope toy,

00:09:48.937 --> 00:09:51.185
and I'm on the keyboard on the left,

00:09:51.185 --> 00:09:53.833
and I've just played the rope key,

00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:57.044
and that's the request for the toy from the human.

00:09:57.044 --> 00:10:00.247
So I've got the rope, I'm diving down,

00:10:00.247 --> 00:10:02.881
and I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention,

00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:03.949
because they're kind of like little kids.

00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:06.506
You have to keep their attention.

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:11.193
I'm going to drop the rope, see if they come over.

00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:13.697
Here they come,

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:15.006
and then they're going to pick up the rope

00:10:15.006 --> 00:10:16.612
and drag it around as a toy.

00:10:16.612 --> 00:10:18.397
Now, I'm at the keyboard on the left,

00:10:18.397 --> 00:10:20.707
and this is actually the first time that we tried this.

00:10:20.707 --> 00:10:23.573
I'm going to try to request this toy, the rope toy,

00:10:23.573 --> 00:10:26.141
from the dolphins using the rope sound.

00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:30.452
Let's see if they might actually understand what that means.

00:10:31.752 --> 00:10:32.978
(Whistle)

00:10:32.978 --> 00:10:35.678
That's the rope whistle.

00:10:35.678 --> 00:10:36.975
Up come the dolphins,

00:10:36.975 --> 00:10:40.580
and drop off the rope, yay. Wow.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.564
(Applause)

00:10:43.564 --> 00:10:45.324
So this is only once.

00:10:45.324 --> 00:10:48.132
We don't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles.

00:10:48.132 --> 00:10:50.600
Okay, so here's a second toy in the water.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.389
This is a scarf toy, and I'm trying to lead the dolphin

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:54.726
over to the keyboard to show her

00:10:54.726 --> 00:10:57.916
the visual and the acoustic signal.

00:10:57.916 --> 00:11:00.983
Now this dolphin, we call her "the scarf thief,"

00:11:00.983 --> 00:11:04.476
because over the years she's absconded

00:11:04.476 --> 00:11:07.054
with about 12 scarves.

00:11:07.054 --> 00:11:10.828
In fact, we think she has a boutique somewhere in the Bahamas.

00:11:10.828 --> 00:11:14.522
So I'm reaching over. She's got the scarf on her right side.

00:11:14.522 --> 00:11:16.286
And we try to not touch the animals too much,

00:11:16.286 --> 00:11:18.422
we really don't want to over-habituate them.

00:11:18.422 --> 00:11:20.537
And I'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard.

00:11:20.537 --> 00:11:24.483
And the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:26.294
to request the scarf.

00:11:26.294 --> 00:11:29.043
So I try to give her the scarf.

00:11:29.043 --> 00:11:32.018
Whoop. Almost lost it.

00:11:32.018 --> 00:11:34.934
But this is the moment where everything becomes possible.

00:11:34.934 --> 00:11:36.679
The dolphin's at the keyboard.

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:38.237
You've got full attention.

00:11:38.237 --> 00:11:40.493
And this sometimes went on for hours.

00:11:40.493 --> 00:11:41.948
And I wanted to share this video with you

00:11:41.948 --> 00:11:43.733
not to show you any big breakthroughs,

00:11:43.733 --> 00:11:44.853
because they haven't happened yet,

00:11:44.853 --> 00:11:47.479
but to show you the level of intention and focus

00:11:47.479 --> 00:11:50.126
that these dolphins have, and interest in the system.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.147
And because of this, we really decided we needed

00:11:52.147 --> 00:11:54.241
some more sophisticated technology.

00:11:54.241 --> 00:11:56.441
So we joined forces with Georgia Tech,

00:11:56.441 --> 00:11:59.117
with Thad Starner's wearable computing group,

00:11:59.117 --> 00:12:01.079
to build us an underwater wearable computer

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:02.945
that we're calling CHAT. [CHAT: Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry]

00:12:02.945 --> 00:12:04.981
Now, instead of pushing a keyboard through the water,

00:12:04.981 --> 00:12:08.599
the diver's wearing the complete system, and it's acoustic only,

00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:11.607
so basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad

00:12:11.607 --> 00:12:12.786
on the forearm,

00:12:12.786 --> 00:12:14.974
the sounds go out through an underwater speaker,

00:12:14.974 --> 00:12:16.384
if a dolphin mimics the whistle

00:12:16.384 --> 00:12:18.893
or a human plays the whistle, the sounds come in

00:12:18.893 --> 00:12:21.469
and are localized by two hydrophones.

00:12:21.469 --> 00:12:24.816
The computer can localize who requested the toy

00:12:24.816 --> 00:12:26.853
if there's a word match.

00:12:26.853 --> 00:12:29.417
And the real power of the system is in the real-time

00:12:29.417 --> 00:12:31.334
sound recognition, so we can respond to the dolphins

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:33.461
quickly and accurately.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:37.645
And we're at prototype stage, but this is how we hope it will play out.

00:12:37.645 --> 00:12:40.923
So Diver A and Diver B both have a wearable computer

00:12:40.923 --> 00:12:43.517
and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle,

00:12:43.517 --> 00:12:45.997
the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water,

00:12:45.997 --> 00:12:48.429
but also as a word through bone conduction.

00:12:48.429 --> 00:12:50.678
So Diver A plays the scarf whistle

00:12:50.678 --> 00:12:52.574
or Diver B plays the sargassum whistle

00:12:52.574 --> 00:12:54.990
to request a toy from whoever has it.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.199
What we hope will happen is that the dolphin mimics the whistle,

00:12:58.199 --> 00:13:01.369
and if Diver A has the sargassum, if that's the sound

00:13:01.369 --> 00:13:04.114
that was played and requested,

00:13:04.114 --> 00:13:07.962
then the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin

00:13:07.962 --> 00:13:09.778
and they'll swim away happily into the sunset

00:13:09.778 --> 00:13:12.895
playing sargassum for forever.

00:13:12.895 --> 00:13:16.275
Now, how far can this kind of communication go?

00:13:16.275 --> 00:13:20.164
Well, CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins

00:13:20.164 --> 00:13:21.746
to request things from us.

00:13:21.746 --> 00:13:24.139
It's designed to really be two-way.

00:13:24.139 --> 00:13:27.418
Now, will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally?

00:13:27.418 --> 00:13:29.299
We hope so and we think so.

00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:31.443
But as we decode their natural sounds,

00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:35.031
we're also planning to put those back into the computerized system.

00:13:35.031 --> 00:13:38.531
For example, right now we can put their own signature whistles

00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:42.626
in the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin.

00:13:42.626 --> 00:13:46.356
Likewise, we can create our own whistles,

00:13:46.356 --> 00:13:48.675
our own whistle names, and let the dolphins

00:13:48.675 --> 00:13:51.443
request specific divers to interact with.

00:13:51.443 --> 00:13:54.364
Now it may be that all our mobile technology

00:13:54.364 --> 00:13:57.500
will actually be the same technology that helps us

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.731
communicate with another species down the road.

00:14:00.731 --> 00:14:04.363
In the case of a dolphin, you know, it's a species that,

00:14:04.363 --> 00:14:07.746
well, they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:10.289
and we might not be able to admit that right now,

00:14:10.289 --> 00:14:12.113
but they live in quite a different environment,

00:14:12.113 --> 00:14:16.613
and you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems.

00:14:16.613 --> 00:14:18.297
I mean, imagine what it would be like

00:14:18.297 --> 00:14:19.906
to really understand the mind

00:14:19.906 --> 00:14:23.691
of another intelligent species on the planet.

00:14:23.691 --> 00:14:25.039
Thank you.

00:14:25.039 --> 00:14:29.963
(Applause)
