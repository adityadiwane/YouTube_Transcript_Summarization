00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I bring to you

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
a message from

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
tens of thousands of people --

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
in the villages, in the slums,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
in the hinterland of the country --

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
who have solved problems

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
through their own genius,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
without any

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
outside help.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
When our home minister announces

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
a few weeks ago

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
a war on

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
one third of India,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
about 200 districts that he mentioned

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
were ungovernable,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
he missed the point.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
The point that we have been stressing

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
for the last 21 years,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
the point that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
people may be economically poor,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
but they're not poor in the mind.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
In other words,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
the minds on the margin

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
are not the marginal minds.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
That is the message,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
which we started 31 years ago.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And what did it start?

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Let me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
which led me to come to this point.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
In '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
advising the government and the research council there

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
how to help scientists work on the lands,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
on the fields of the poor people,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and how to develop research technologies,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
which are based on the knowledge of the people.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
I came back in '86.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I had been tremendously invigorated

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
which had 60 percent landlessness

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
but amazing creativity.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
I started looking at my own work:

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
The work that I had done

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
for the previous 10 years,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
almost every time,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
had instances of knowledge

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
that people had shared.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Now, I was paid in dollars as a consultant,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and I looked at my income tax return

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
which shows how much of this income has gone

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
to the people whose knowledge

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
has made it possible?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Was it because I'm brilliant

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
that I'm getting this reward, or because of the revolution?

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
Is it that I write very well?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Is it that I articulate very well?

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Is it that I analyze the data very well?

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Is it because I'm a professor, and, therefore,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
I must be entitled to this reward from society?"

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
I tried to convince myself that, "No, no,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
I have worked for the policy changes.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
You know, the public policy will become

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
more responsive to the needs of the poor,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
and, therefore I think it's okay."

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
But it appeared to me

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation --

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
exploitation by landlords,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
by moneylenders, by traders --

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
gave me an insight that

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
probably I was also an exploiter,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
because there was no line in my income tax return

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
which showed this income accrued

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
because of the brilliance of the people --

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me --

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and nothing ever went back to them.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
So much so, that much of my work till that time

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
was in the English language.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
So what kind of a contributor was I?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
I was talking about social justice,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and here I was, a professional

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
who was pursuing the most unjust act --

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
getting rent from that knowledge

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
publishing them in the papers,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
getting invited to the conferences,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
getting consultancies and whatever have you.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
So then, a dilemma rose in the mind that,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
if I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right;

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
life cannot go on like that.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
because I couldn't live with it any longer.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
So I did a review of

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
wrote, read about 100 papers.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And I came to the conclusion that

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
while dilemma is unique,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And one day -- I don't know what happened --

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
while coming back from the office towards home,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
maybe I saw a honey bee

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
life would be wonderful.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
What the honey bee does: it pollinates,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
takes nectar from the flower,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And when it takes the nectar,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
the flowers don't feel shortchanged.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
In fact, they invite the honey bees

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
through their colors,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network:

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
that whenever we learn something from people

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
it must be shared with them in their language.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
They must not remain anonymous.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
And I must tell you that after 20 years,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
I have not made one percent of change

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
in the professional practice of this art.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
That is a great tragedy -- which I'm carrying still with me

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and I hope that all of you will carry this with you --

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
that the profession still legitimizes publication

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
of knowledge of people without attributing them

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
by making them anonymous.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
or Research Councils of the U.K.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
or of Indian Councils of Science Research

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
do not require

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
that whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
We are talking about an accountable society,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
a society that is fair and just,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And India wants to be a knowledge society.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
How will it be a knowledge society?

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
So, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
one for yourself and one for others.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
It must be the same.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
You cannot discriminate.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
You cannot be in favor of your own values,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
which are at a distance from

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
the values that you espouse.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
So, fairness to one and to the other

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
is not divisible.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Look at this picture.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
Can you tell me where has it been taken from,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and what is it meant for? Anybody?

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
I'm a professor; I must quiz you. (Laughter)

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Anybody? Any guess at all?

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Pardon? (Audience Member: Rajasthan.)

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
Anil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for?

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
(Murmuring)

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Pardon?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
because this man knows how insensitive our government is.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Look at this. This is the site of the government of India.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
It invites tourists

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
to see the shame of our country.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
I'm so sorry to say that.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
Is this a beautiful picture

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
or is it a terrible picture?

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
If this woman has to carry water on her head

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
for miles and miles and miles,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
you cannot be celebrating that.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
We should be doing something about it.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
And let me tell you, with all the science and technology at our command,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
millions of women still carry water on their heads.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
And we do not ask this question.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
You must have taken tea in the morning.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Think for a minute.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
The leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes;

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
you know what the action is? The action is:

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
The lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Just do it 10 times;

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
you will realize the pain in this shoulder.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And she does it a few thousand times

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
every day.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
The rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
is transplanted by women

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
bending in a very awkward posture,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
millions of them,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
every season, in the paddy season,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
when they transplant paddy

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
with their feet in the water.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
And feet in the water will develop fungus,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
infections,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and that infection pains

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
because then other insects bite that point.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
And every year,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
No machines have been developed.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
So the silence of scientists,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
of technologists, of public policy makers,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
of the change agent, drew our attention that this is not on, this is not on;

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
this is not the way society will work.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
This is not what our parliament would do. You know,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
we have a program for employment:

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
One hundred, 250 million people

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Doing what? Breaking stones, digging earth.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
So we asked a question to the parliament:

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Do poor have heads?

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head?

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And what has happened?

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
An anonymous, faceless, nameless person

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
gets in contact with the network,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and then gets an identity.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
This is what Honey Bee Network is about.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
And this network grew voluntarily,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
continues to be voluntary,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
and has tried to map the minds

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
of millions of people

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
of our country and other parts of the world who are creative.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
They could be creative in terms of education,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
they may be creative in terms of culture,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
they may be creative in terms of institutions;

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
the innovations,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
either in terms of contemporary innovations,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
or in terms of traditional knowledge.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
And it all begins with curiosity.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
It all begins with curiosity.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
This person, whom we met -- and you will see it on the website,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
www.sristi.org -- this tribal person,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
he had a wish.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
And he said, "If my wish gets fulfilled" --

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
somebody was sick and he had to monitor --

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
"God, please cure him.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
And if you cure him, I will get my wall painted."

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
And this is what he got painted.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
There could be nothing more wrong than

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
Kabir, Rahim, all the great Sufi saints,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
they were all poor people,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and they had a great reason. (Applause)

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
Please do not ever think that

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
Any person anywhere is capable

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
of rising to that highest point of attainment,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
Look at this.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
in different parts of the country.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
I've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
So on the wayside

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
we found these dung cakes,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
which are used as a fuel.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Now, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
has made a painting.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
That's the only space she could express her creativity.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And she's so marvelous.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
Look at this lady, Ram Timari Devi,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
on a grain bin. In Champaran, we had a Shodh Yatra

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
and we were walking

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
in the land where Gandhiji went

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
to hear about the tragedy, pain

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
of indigo growers.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
Look at what she has done.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
Is she an artisan or an artist?

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Obviously she's an artist; she's a creative person.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
If we can create markets for these artists,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
They will be paid for what they are good at, not what they're bad at.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.260
(Applause)

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Look at what Rojadeen has done.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
In Motihari in Champaran,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
and, obviously, there's a limited market for tea.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
So he thought, why don't I convert

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
a pressure cooker into a coffee machine?

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
People bring their own cooker,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
he attaches a valve and a steam pipe,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
and now he gives you espresso coffee. (Laughter)

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Now, this is a real, affordable

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
coffee percolator that works on gas.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
(Applause)

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
A lot of poor people do not have

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
enough grains to get ground.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
So this fellow is bringing

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
If you have 500 grams, 1000, one kilogram,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
he will grind it for it for you; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
Please understand the problem of poor people.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
They have needs which

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
have to be met efficiently

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
They don't want second-standard, second-quality outputs.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
But to be able to give them high-quality output

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
you need to adapt technology to their needs.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
But that's not enough, what he did. Look at what he did here.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
he brought a washing machine

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
to your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
So here's a model where

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
a two-wheeler washing machine ...

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
(Applause)

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
You bring your water, you bring your soap,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
I wash the clothes for you. Charge 50 paisa, one rupee

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
for you per lot,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and a new business model can emerge.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
Now, what we need is, we need

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
people who will be able to scale them up.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Look at this.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
It looks like a beautiful photograph.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Somebody from India would know, of course.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
It's a tawa.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
It's a hot plate made of clay.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Now, what is the beauty in it?

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
When you have a non-stick pan,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
it costs about,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
maybe, 250 rupees,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
five dollars, six dollars.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
This is less than a dollar

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
and this is non-stick;

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
it is coated with one of these

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
food-grade materials.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And the best part is that,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
while you use a costly non-stick pan,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
you eat the so-called Teflon

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
or Teflon-like material

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that. (Laughter)

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
You know? But here

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
in this clay hot plate,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
it will never go into your stomach.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
So it is better, it is safer;

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
it is affordable, it is energy-efficient.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
need not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
They have to be better, they have to be more efficient,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
they have to be affordable.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
He has designed this plate with a handle.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
And now with one dollar,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
you can afford a better alternative

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
than the people market is offering you.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
This lady, she developed

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
a herbal pesticide formulation.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
We filed the patent for her,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
the National Innovation Foundation.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
And who knows? Somebody will license this technology

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
and develop marketable products,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
and she would get revenue.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
Now, let me mention one thing:

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
I think we need a polycentric model of development,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
in different parts of the world,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
would solve the needs of locality

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
in a very efficient and adaptive manner.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
Higher the local fit,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
greater is the chance of scaling up.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
In the scaling up,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
there's an inherent inadequacy

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
to match the needs of the local people,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
point by point, with the supply that you're making.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
Things can scale up, and they have scaled up.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
For example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
only three options on the cellphone.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
It has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
but I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
But if I had to get a match to match,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
obviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
So what we're saying is that scalability

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
should not become an enemy of sustainability.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
There must be a place in the world

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
for solutions that are only relevant for a locality,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
and yet, one can be able to fund them.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
that many times investors would ask this question --

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
"What is a scalable model?" --

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
as if the need of a community, which is only

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
located in a space and time

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
and has those needs only located in those places,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
has no legitimate right to get them for free

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
because it's not part of a larger scale.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
So either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
or else you remain out.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
Now, the eminent model, the long-tail model

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
tells you that small sales

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
of a large number of books, for example,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
having only a few copies sold

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
can still be a viable model.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
And we must find a mechanism where

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
where different innovations will go to

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
a small number of people in their localities,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
and yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
Look at what he is doing.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
At the age of 70,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
he is linking up something very creative.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.260
(Music)

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
Saidullah Sahib: I couldn't wait for the boat.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
I had to meet my love.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
My desperation made me an innovator.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.260
Even love needs help from technology.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
Innovation is the light of my wife, Noor.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
New inventions are the passion of my life.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
My technology.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:06.260
(Applause)

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
AG: Saidulluh Sahib is

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
in Motihari, again in Champaran.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
Wonderful human being,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
but he stills sells, at this age,

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
because we haven't been able to convince the water park people,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
the lake people, in [unclear] operations.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.260
and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water --

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
because you can then go to those lanes

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.260
where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
So we have not yet cracked the problem

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.260
of making it available as a rescue device,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
as a vending device during the floods in eastern India,

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
when you have to deliver things to people

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
in different islands

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
where they're marooned.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
What has Appachan done? Appachan, unfortunately, is no more,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
but he has left behind a message.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
A very powerful message

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
Appachan: I watch the world wake up every day.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260
(Music)

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
It's not that a coconut fell on my head,

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.260
and I came upon this idea.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.260
With no money to fund my studies,

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.260
I scaled new heights.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.260
Now, they call me the local Spiderman.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
My technology.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.260
(Applause)

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.260
AG: Many of you

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.260
might not realize and believe

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
that we have sold this product internationally --

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.260
what I call a G2G model,

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.260
grassroots to global.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.260
And a professor in the University of Massachusetts,

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
in the zoology department,

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.260
bought this climber because she wanted

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.260
to study the insect diversity

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.260
of the top of the tree canopy.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
And this device makes it possible

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
for her to take samples from a larger number of palms,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
rather than only a few,

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
because otherwise she had to make a big platform

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260
and then climb her [unclear] would climb on that.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
So, you know, we are advancing the frontiers of science.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
Remya Jose has developed ...

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260
you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.260
and then you will find these videos.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.260
Innovation by her when she was in class 10th:

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.260
a washing machine-cum-exercising machine.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.260
Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person,

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
one and a half foot height, only.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.260
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.260
and freedom and flexibility.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.260
This innovation is from the slums of Rio.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.260
And this person, Mr. Ubirajara.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.260
We were talking about, my friends in Brazil,

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.260
how we scale up this model in China and Brazil.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.260
And we have a very vibrant network in China, particularly,

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.260
but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.260
This stand on the front wheel, you will not find on any cycle.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.260
India and China have the largest number of cycles.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.260
But this innovation emerged in Brazil.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.260
The point is, none of us should be parochial,

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.260
none of us should be so nationalistic to believe

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.260
that all good ideas will come only from our country.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.260
No, we have to have the humility to learn

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.260
from knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.260
And look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations:

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.260
cycle that's a sprayer, cycle that

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.260
generates energy from the shocks on the road.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.260
I can't change the condition of the road,

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.260
but I can make the cycle run faster.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.260
That is what Kanak Das has done.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.260
And in South Africa,

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.260
we had taken our innovators,

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.260
and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.260
as to how innovation can become

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.260
a means of liberation

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.260
from the drudgery that people have.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.260
And this is a donkey cart which they modified.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.260
There's an axle here, of 30, 40 kg,

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.260
serving no purpose.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.260
Remove it, the cart needs one donkey less.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.260
This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.260
These three people in the village

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.260
sat down and decided to think,

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.260
"How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village?"

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.260
They were not related to her, but they tried to find out,

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.260
"How can we use ... "

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.260
They used a cycle, they put together a breathing apparatus.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.260
And this breathing apparatus now saved the life,

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.260
and she's very welcome.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.260
There's a whole range of innovations that we have.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.260
A car, which runs on compressed air

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.260
with six paisa per kilometer.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.260
Assam, Kanak Gogoi.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.260
And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe,

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.260
but this is available in India.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.260
Now, this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.260
for Pochampally Saree.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.260
In one day, 18,000 times,

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.260
she had to do this winding

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.260
to generate two sarees.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.260
This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.260
She said, "Change your profession."

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.260
He said, "I can't. This is the only thing I know, but I'll invent a machine,

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.260
which will solve your problem."

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.260
And this is what he did, a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.260
So, this is what SRISTI is saying:

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.260
"Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world."

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.260
I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.260
for creativity, a whole range of things.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.260
We have sold things all over the world,

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.260
from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.260
Products have gone to the market, a few.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.260
These are the people whose knowledge made

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.260
this Herbavate cream for eczema possible.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.260
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.260
put a photograph of the innovator on the packing

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.260
so that every time a user uses it,

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.260
it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.260
If you have an idea, send it back to us."

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.260
So, creativity counts, knowledge matters,

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.260
innovations transform, incentives inspire.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.260
And incentives: not just material, but also non-material incentives.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.260
Thank you.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:47.260
(Applause)
