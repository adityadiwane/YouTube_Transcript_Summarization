00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.717
The shocking police crackdown
on protestors in Ferguson, Missouri,

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:20.729
in the wake of the police 
shooting of Michael Brown,

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:24.952
underscored the extent to which advanced
military weapons and equipment,

00:00:24.952 --> 00:00:26.684
designed for the battlefield,

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:27.993
are making their way

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:31.874
to small-town police departments
across the United States.

00:00:32.514 --> 00:00:34.500
Although much tougher to observe,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.047
this same thing is happening 
with surveillance equipment.

00:00:38.047 --> 00:00:40.707
NSA-style mass 
surveillance is enabling

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.665
local police departments 
to gather vast quantities

00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:47.232
of sensitive information
about each and every one of us

00:00:47.232 --> 00:00:51.284
in a way that was
never previously possible.

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:54.760
Location information can 
be very sensitive.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.391
If you drive your car around
the United States,

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.314
it can reveal if you go 
to a therapist,

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:01.782
attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting,

00:01:01.782 --> 00:01:04.603
if you go to church 
or if you don't go to church.

00:01:04.603 --> 00:01:06.329
And when that 
information about you

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.824
is combined with the same information
about everyone else,

00:01:09.824 --> 00:01:12.398
the government can gain 
a detailed portrait

00:01:12.398 --> 00:01:15.114
of how private citizens interact.

00:01:15.114 --> 00:01:17.589
This information used to be private.

00:01:17.589 --> 00:01:19.282
Thanks to modern technology,

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:23.610
the government knows far too much
about what happens behind closed doors.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.998
And local police departments make
decisions about who they think you are

00:01:27.998 --> 00:01:31.169
based on this information.

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:35.816
One of the key technologies 
driving mass location tracking

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:38.774
is the innocuous-sounding
Automatic License Plate Reader.

00:01:38.774 --> 00:01:40.469
If you haven't seen one,

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.657
it's probably because you didn't
know what to look for --

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:45.032
they're everywhere.

00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:48.104
Mounted on roads or 
on police cars,

00:01:48.104 --> 00:01:52.533
Automatic License Plate Readers
capture images of every passing car

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:56.148
and convert the license plate
into machine-readable text

00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:59.560
so that they can be checked
against hot lists

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.845
of cars potentially wanted
for wrongdoing.

00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:04.972
But more than that, increasingly,

00:02:04.972 --> 00:02:07.122
local police departments 
are keeping records

00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:10.282
not just of people wanted for wrongdoing,

00:02:10.282 --> 00:02:13.084
but of every plate that 
passes them by,

00:02:13.084 --> 00:02:17.053
resulting in the collection
of mass quantities of data

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:19.294
about where Americans have gone.

00:02:19.294 --> 00:02:20.902
Did you know this
was happening?

00:02:21.822 --> 00:02:25.228
When Mike Katz-Lacabe asked
his local police department

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:28.657
for information about the plate
reader data they had on him,

00:02:28.657 --> 00:02:30.335
this is what they got:

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:33.477
in addition to the date, 
time and location,

00:02:33.477 --> 00:02:36.508
the police department had 
photographs that captured

00:02:36.508 --> 00:02:39.898
where he was going and 
often who he was with.

00:02:39.898 --> 00:02:43.720
The second photo from the top
is a picture of Mike and his two daughters

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.552
getting out of their car
in their own driveway.

00:02:47.552 --> 00:02:50.340
The government has 
hundreds of photos like this

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.111
about Mike going about his daily life.

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:55.295
And if you drive a car 
in the United States,

00:02:55.295 --> 00:02:58.028
I would bet money 
that they have photographs

00:02:58.028 --> 00:03:00.946
like this of you going
about your daily life.

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:02.987
Mike hasn't done anything wrong.

00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:06.942
Why is it okay that the government
is keeping all of this information?

00:03:06.942 --> 00:03:08.721
The reason it's happening is because,

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:12.072
as the cost of storing
this data has plummeted,

00:03:12.072 --> 00:03:14.584
the police departments
simply hang on to it,

00:03:14.584 --> 00:03:18.366
just in case it could be useful someday.

00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:20.866
The issue is not just that
one police department

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:23.487
is gathering this information in isolation

00:03:23.487 --> 00:03:26.246
or even that multiple police 
departments are doing it.

00:03:26.246 --> 00:03:28.743
At the same time, the federal government

00:03:28.743 --> 00:03:32.361
is collecting all of these
individual pots of data,

00:03:32.361 --> 00:03:35.682
and pooling them together 
into one vast database

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.338
with hundreds of millions of hits,

00:03:37.338 --> 00:03:39.456
showing where Americans have traveled.

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:42.964
This document from the 
Federal Drug Enforcement Administration,

00:03:42.964 --> 00:03:45.729
which is one of the agencies
primarily interested in this,

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:50.166
is one of several that reveal 
the existence of this database.

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:52.735
Meanwhile, in New York City,

00:03:52.735 --> 00:03:56.677
the NYPD has driven police cars
equipped with license plate readers

00:03:56.677 --> 00:04:00.851
past mosques in order to
figure out who is attending.

00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:04.689
The uses and abuses of this technology
aren't limited to the United States.

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.724
In the U.K., the police department

00:04:07.724 --> 00:04:11.868
put 80-year-old John Kat
on a plate reader watch list

00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:16.145
after he had attended dozens of
lawful political demonstrations

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:20.771
where he liked to sit on a bench
and sketch the attendees.

00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:24.293
License plate readers aren't the
only mass location tracking technology

00:04:24.293 --> 00:04:26.449
available to law enforcement agents today.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.461
Through a technique known as
a cell tower dump,

00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:32.713
law enforcement agents can
uncover who was using

00:04:32.713 --> 00:04:34.998
one or more cell towers
at a particular time,

00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:37.030
a technique which has been known to reveal

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.309
the location of tens of thousands
and even hundreds of thousands of people.

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:44.549
Also, using a device known as a StingRay,

00:04:44.549 --> 00:04:47.185
law enforcement agents
can send tracking signals

00:04:47.185 --> 00:04:51.550
inside people's houses
to identify the cell phones located there.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.812
And if they don't know
which house to target,

00:04:53.812 --> 00:04:55.998
they've been known 
to drive this technology

00:04:55.998 --> 00:04:59.424
around through whole neighborhoods.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:04.060
Just as the police in Ferguson possess
high-tech military weapons and equipment,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.042
so too do police departments across
the United States

00:05:07.042 --> 00:05:09.377
possess high-tech surveillance gear.

00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:11.408
Just because you don't see it,

00:05:11.408 --> 00:05:13.793
doesn't mean it's not there.

00:05:13.793 --> 00:05:16.344
The question is, what should
we do about this?

00:05:16.344 --> 00:05:19.654
I think this poses a serious
civil liberties threat.

00:05:19.654 --> 00:05:24.016
History has shown that once the police 
have massive quantities of data,

00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:26.095
tracking the movements of innocent people,

00:05:26.095 --> 00:05:30.411
it gets abused, maybe for blackmail,
maybe for political advantage,

00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:32.670
or maybe for simple voyeurism.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.012
Fortunately, there are steps we can take.

00:05:35.012 --> 00:05:38.742
Local police departments can 
be governed by the city councils,

00:05:38.742 --> 00:05:41.664
which can pass laws requiring the police

00:05:41.664 --> 00:05:44.586
to dispose of the data 
about innocent people

00:05:44.586 --> 00:05:47.748
while allowing the legitimate
uses of the technology to go forward.

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:49.423
Thank you.

00:05:49.423 --> 00:05:53.424
(Applause).
