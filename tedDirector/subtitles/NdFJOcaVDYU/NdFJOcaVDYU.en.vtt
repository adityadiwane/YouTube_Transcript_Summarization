00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
You can mimic what you can see.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.160
Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
I'm going to tell you about that technology.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.160
People have wanted to look inside the human mind,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
the human brain, for thousands of years.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.160
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
People envision this as being very difficult.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.160
You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
It was terribly dangerous. (Laughter)

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
But now, we have a real technology to do this.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.160
We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.160
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body --

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
but more importantly, we can look into his mind.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.160
is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160
What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.160
and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.160
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.160
If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
There have been three ways to try to impact the brain:

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
the therapist's couch, pills and the knife.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.160
We all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.160
Chronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.160
we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
and then we can select the areas that produce the pain.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.160
Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
and select brain areas to do that same thing.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.160
What you're seeing here is, we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.160
This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
They're watching their own brain activation,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.160
and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.160
They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
As they do it, in the upper left is a display

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.160
that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.160
When they control their brain, they can control their pain.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
This is an investigational technology,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.160
but, in clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.160
This is not "The Matrix." You can only do this to yourself. You take control.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.160
I've seen inside my brain. You will too, soon.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.160
When you do, what do you want to control?

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.160
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself, all your experiences.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.160
These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
But I want to leave with you the big question.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
using this technology, the human mind and brain.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
Where will we take it?
