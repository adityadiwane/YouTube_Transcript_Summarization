00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
so I put children to sleep for a living.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
(Laughter)

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.260
(Laughter)

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
But what I actually mostly do

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
is I manage the pain management service

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And it's from the experience

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
from about 20 or 25 years of doing that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
that I want to bring to you the message this morning,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
that pain is a disease.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Now most of the time,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
you think of pain as a symptom of a disease,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and that's true most of the time.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
or an inflammation or an operation.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
But about 10 percent of the time,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
after the patient has recovered from one of those events,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
pain persists.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
It persists for months

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and oftentimes for years,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
and when that happens,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
it is its own disease.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and what we can do about it,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
I want to show you how it feels for my patients.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
So imagine, if you will,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
that I'm stroking your arm with this feather,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
as I'm stroking my arm right now.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Now, I want you to imagine

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
that I'm stroking it with this.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Please keep your seat.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
(Laughter)

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
A very different feeling.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain?

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Imagine what your life would be like

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
if I were to stroke it with this feather,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
but your brain was telling you

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
that this is what you are feeling --

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
In fact, imagine something even worse.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and their brain [was] telling them

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
that they were feeling this hot torch.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
That was the experience of my patient, Chandler,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
whom you see in the photograph.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
She was 16 years old last year when I met her,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and she aspired to be a professional dancer.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Now you would probably imagine, as she did,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
that a wrist sprain is a trivial event

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
in a person's life.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Wrap it in an ACE bandage,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
take some ibuprofen for a week or two,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
and that's the end of the story.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
This is what her arm looked like

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
You can see that the arm is discolored,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
purplish in color.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
It was cadaverically cold to the touch.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
The muscles were frozen, paralyzed --

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
dystonic is how we refer to that.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
almost all the way to her shoulder.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
But the worst part was,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
The worst part was that she had allodynia,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
with the feather and with the torch.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
The lightest touch of her arm --

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
the touch of a hand,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on --

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.260
caused excruciating, burning pain.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
How can the nervous system get this so wrong?

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
How can the nervous system

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
misinterpret an innocent sensation

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
like the touch of a hand

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and turn it into the malevolent sensation

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
of the touch of the flame?

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
is hardwired like your house.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
In your house, wires run in the wall,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and from the junction box to the light bulb.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.260
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
If you hit your thumb with a hammer,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves --

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
where new wires, new nerves,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
take the information up to the brain

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.260
where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
But the situation, of course, in the human body

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
is far more complicated than that.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Instead of it being the case

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
that that junction box in the spinal cord

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
by releasing these little brown packets

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
of chemical information called neurotransmitters

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
in a linear one-on-one fashion,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
in fact, what happens

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions --

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord --

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and they start interacting

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
with other adjacent cells.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
These cells, called glial cells,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
were once thought to be

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
that did nothing more than hold all the important things together,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
like the nerves.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
But it turns out

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
the glial cells have a vital role

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
in the modulation, amplification

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and, in the case of pain, the distortion

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
of sensory experiences.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
These glial cells become activated.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
which spill out

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
and interact with adjacent nerves,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and they start releasing their neurotransmitters,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
and those neurotransmitters spill out

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
until what we have

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
is a positive feedback loop.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
It's almost as if somebody came into your home

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and rewired your walls

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
so that the next time you turned on the light switch,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
the toilet flushed three doors down,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
or your dishwasher went on,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
or your computer monitor turned off.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
That's crazy,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
but that's, in fact, what happens

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
with chronic pain.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And that's why pain becomes its own disease.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
The nervous system has plasticity.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
It changes, and it morphs

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
in response to stimuli.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Well, what do we do about that?

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
What can we do in a case like Chandler's?

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
at this point in time.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs --

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
painkillers --

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
which are, frankly, not very effective

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
for this kind of pain.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
We take nerves that are noisy and active

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
that should be quiet,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And most importantly, what we do

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.260
is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
of physical therapy and occupational therapy

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
to retrain the nerves in the nervous system

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
to respond normally

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
to the activities and sensory experiences

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
that are part of everyday life.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
And we support all of that

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
with an intensive psychotherapy program

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
to address the despondency, despair and depression

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
that always accompanies

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
severe, chronic pain.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
It's successful,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
as you can see from this video of Chandler,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
who, two months after we first met her,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
is now doings a back flip.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And I had lunch with her yesterday

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
and she's doing absolutely fantastic.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.260
But the future is actually even brighter.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
The future holds the promise

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
that new drugs will be developed

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
that are not symptom-modifying drugs

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
that simply mask the problem,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
as we have now,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
but that will be disease-modifying drugs

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
that will actually go right to the root of the problem

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
and attack those glial cells,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
or those pernicious proteins

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that the glial cells elaborate,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
or plasticity,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
that so is capable

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
of distorting and amplifying

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
the sensory experience that we call pain.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
So I have hope

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
that in the future,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
who said, "My philosophy:

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
No pain, no pain."

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Thank you very much.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:07.260
(Applause)
