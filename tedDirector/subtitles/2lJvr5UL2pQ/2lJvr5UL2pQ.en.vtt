00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
So the first question is, why do we need to

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
even worry about a pandemic threat?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
What is it that we're concerned about?

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
When I say "we," I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
We're concerned in the national security community,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
and of course in the biology community and the public health community.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
While globalization has increased travel,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
all the time, all over the world.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
So a plague outbreak in Surat, India

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
becomes not an obscure event, but a globalized event --

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
Katrina showed us

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
that we cannot completely depend on government

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
to have readiness in hand, to be capable of handling things.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.160
Indeed, an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H5N1 flu --

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
some of you call it bird flu --

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
which first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
but we didn't know about it until 1997.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
At the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
But we're now up to 55 countries in the world,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
have had this virus emerge,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
in either birds, or people or both.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
In the bird outbreaks we now can see

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
except the Americas.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.160
And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
In domestic birds, especially chickens,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
it's 100 percent lethal.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
It's one of the most lethal things we've seen

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
in circulation in the world

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
in any recent centuries.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
with the result that there's cover-up.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
It's also carried on migration patterns

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
of wild migratory aquatic birds.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
There has been this centralized event

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
in a place called Lake Chenghai, China.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
Two years ago the migrating birds

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
had a multiple event

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
where thousands died because of a mutation occurring

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
in the virus,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
which made the species range broaden dramatically.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
So that birds going to Siberia, to Europe, and to Africa

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
carried the virus, which had not previously been possible.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160
We're now seeing outbreaks in human populations --

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
so far, fortunately, small events,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
tiny outbreaks, occasional clusters.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
to form two distinct families, if you will,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
of the H5N1 viral tree

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
with branches in them,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
and with different attributes that are worrying.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
So what's concerning us? Well, first of all,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
at no time in history have we succeeded in making

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
for more than 260 million people.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
You've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
But nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
if we have a real outbreak.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
So one thought is:

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
after 9/11, when the airports closed,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
our flu season was delayed by two weeks.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
So the thought is, hey, maybe what we should do is just

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.160
immediately -- we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
the virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter --

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
let's shut down the airports.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.160
However, huge supercomputer analyses,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
done of the likely effectiveness of this,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
show that it won't buy us much time at all.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.160
And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
For example, all masks are made in China.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
How do you get them mobilized around the world

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
if you've shut all the airports down?

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
How do you get the vaccines moved around the world

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
and the drugs moved, and whatever may or not be available that would work.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.160
So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
We're worried because this virus, unlike any other flu

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.160
we've ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meat

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
of the infected animals.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
and now also domestic pet dogs.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.160
we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu:

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
seizures, central nervous system disorders, partial paralysis.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
This is not your normal garden-variety flu.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
It mimics what we now understand

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
about reconstructing the 1918 flu virus,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
the last great pandemic,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
in that it also jumped directly from birds to people.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
We had evolution over time,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.160
and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings:

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
55 percent of people who have become infected

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.160
with H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
And we don't have a huge number of people

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
who got infected and never developed disease.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
In experimental feeding in monkeys

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
you can see that it actually downregulates

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
a specific immune system modulator.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
The result is that what kills you

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
is not the virus directly, but your own immune system overreacting, saying,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
"Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk."

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
The result: most of the deaths

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
have been in people under 30 years of age,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
robustly healthy young adults.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
We have seen human-to-human transmission

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
in at least three clusters --

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
fortunately involving very intimate contact,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
Alright, so I've got you nervous.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
Now you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
And we have spent a lot of money.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
Most of the spending in the Bush administration

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.160
has actually been more related to the anthrax results

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160
and bio-terrorism threat.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
But a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
to look at infectious diseases.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
End result: only 15 states

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
have been certified to be able to do mass distribution

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
Half the states would run out of hospital beds

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
in the first week, maybe two weeks.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
And 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
Add on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
So what have people been doing with this money?

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
Exercises, drills, all over the world.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
Let's pretend there's a pandemic.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
Let's everybody run around and play your role.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
Main result is that there is tremendous confusion.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
And the bottom line, major thing that has come through

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
in every single drill: nobody knows who's in charge.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
Nobody knows the chain of command.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
If it were Los Angeles, is it the mayor, the governor,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
the President of the United States, the head of Homeland Security?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
In fact, the federal government says it's a guy called

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
the Principle Federal Officer,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
who happens to be with TSA.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.160
The government says

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
the federal responsibility will basically be

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
about trying to keep the virus out, which we all know is impossible,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
and then to mitigate the impact

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
primarily on our economy.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
The rest is up to your local community.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160
Everything is about your town, where you live.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
Well how good a city council you have,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.160
how good a mayor you have -- that's who's going to be in charge.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
Most local facilities would all be competing

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
to try and get their hands on their piece

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
which may or may not be helpful -- I'll get into that --

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
of available vaccines, and any other treatments,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
and masks, and anything that's been stockpiled.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
And you'll have massive competition.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
Now we did purchase a vaccine, you've probably all heard about it,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160
made by Sanofi-Aventis.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160
Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
The vaccine will probably be useless.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
So here's where the decisions come in.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
You're the mayor of your local town.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
Let's see, should we order that all pets be kept indoors?

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
Germany did that when H5N1 appeared in Germany last year,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
in order to minimize the spread

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.160
between households by household cats, dogs and so on.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.160
What do we do when we don't have any containment rooms

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
to take care of patients?

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
These are in Hong Kong; we have nothing like that here.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
What about quarantine?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.160
During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
We have no uniform policies

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
regarding quarantine across the United States.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.160
And some states have differential policies, county by county.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
But what about the no-brainer things? Should we close all the schools?

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
Well then what about all the workers? They won't go to work

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
if their kids aren't in school.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
Encouraging telecommuting? What works?

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Well the British government did a model of telecommuting.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
Six weeks they had all people in the banking industry

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
pretend a pandemic was underway.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
What they found was, the core functions --

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
you know you still sort of had banks,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
Nobody was processing the credit cards.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
Your insurance payments didn't go through.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.160
And basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.160
And that's just office workers, bankers.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160
We don't know how important hand washing is for flu --

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
shocking. One assumes it's a good idea to wash your hands a lot.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
But actually in scientific community there is great debate

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
about what percentage of flu transmission between people

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
is from sneezing and coughing

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
and what percentage is on your hands.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.160
The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160
Can we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masks

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160
because we don't make them in America anymore,

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
they're all made in China --

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.160
do we need N95? A state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.160
must-be-fitted-to-your-face mask?

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.160
Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
In the SARS epidemic, we learned in Hong Kong

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
that most of transmission was because

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
people were removing their masks improperly.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.160
and then they rubbed their nose. Bingo! They got SARS.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
It wasn't flying microbes.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
If you go online right now, you'll get so much phony-baloney information.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.160
You'll end up buying -- this is called an N95 mask. Ridiculous.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
We don't actually have a standard

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.160
for what should be the protective gear for the first responders,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
the people who will actually be there on the front lines.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
And Tamiflu. You've probably heard of this drug,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
made by Hoffmann-La Roche, patented drug.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
There is some indication

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160
well, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.160
A public health survey analyzed the effect

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.160
that large-scale Tamiflu use would have,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
actually shows it counteractive

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
to public health measures, making matters worse.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
And here is the other interesting thing:

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
when a human being ingests Tamiflu, only 20 percent

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
is metabolized appropriately

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
to be an active compound in the human being.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.160
The rest turns into a stable compound,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
which survives filtration into the water systems,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
and providing them a chance

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
to breed resistant strains.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
And we now have seen Tamiflu-resistant strains

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
in both Vietnam in person-to-person transmission,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
and in Egypt in person-to-person transmission.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160
So I personally think that our life expectancy

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
for Tamiflu as an effective drug

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
is very limited -- very limited indeed.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
Nevertheless most of the governments

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
have based their whole flu policies

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
on building stockpiles of Tamiflu.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
Russia has actually stockpiled enough

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
for 95 percent of all Russians.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
We've stockpiled enough for 30 percent.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160
When I say enough, that's two weeks worth.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.160
And then you're on your own because

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.160
the pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
Some of the poorer countries

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
that have had the most experience with H5N1 have built up stockpiles;

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160
they're already expired. They are already out of date.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
What do we know from 1918,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.160
the last great pandemic?

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.160
The federal government abdicated most responsibility.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.160
And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
all over America.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
Every city, county, state did their own thing.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
And the rules

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
and the belief systems were wildly disparate.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
In some cases all schools, all churches,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
all public venues were closed.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
The pandemic circulated three times in 18 months

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
in the absence of commercial air travel.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
The second wave was the mutated, super-killer wave.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
But by the time the second wave hit

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
it took such a toll among the healthcare workers

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.160
that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
Overall we lost 700,000 people.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
The virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant women

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
and we don't actually know why.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
Most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds --

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
robustly healthy young adults.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
It was likened to the plague.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
We don't actually know how many people died.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
The low-ball estimate is 35 million.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.160
This was based on European and North American data.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160
A new study by Chris Murray at Harvard

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
shows that if you look at the databases that were kept

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
by the Brits in India,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.160
there was a 31-fold greater death rate among the Indians.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
the death toll was far higher.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160
And that a more likely toll

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
before we had commercial air travel.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
So are we ready?

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.160
As a nation, no we're not.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
And I think even those in the leadership

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
would say that is the case,

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
that we still have a long ways to go.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
So what does that mean for you? Well the first thing is,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything --

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.160
for yourself, your family, or your employees --

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.160
unless you've really done your homework.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.160
What mask works, what mask doesn't work.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
How many masks do you need?

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
The Institute of Medicine study felt that

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
you could not recycle masks.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.160
Well if you think it's going to last 18 months,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
are you going to buy 18 months worth of masks

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
for every single person in your family?

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.160
We don't know -- again with Tamiflu,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
the number one side effect of Tamiflu is

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160
flu-like symptoms.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160
So then how can you tell

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
who in your family has the flu

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160
if everybody is taking Tamiflu?

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.160
If you expand that out to think of a whole community,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
or all your employees in your company,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
you begin to realize how limited

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
the Tamiflu option might be.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.160
Everybody has come up to me and said,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.160
well I'll stockpile water or, I'll stockpile food, or what have you.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
But really? Do you really have a place

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
to stockpile 18 months worth of food? Twenty-four months worth of food?

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
Do you want to view the pandemic threat

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
the way back in the 1950s

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.160
people viewed the civil defense issue,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160
and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.160
I don't think that's rational.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.160
I think it's about having to be prepared

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.160
as communities, not as individuals --

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
being prepared as nation,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160
being prepared as state, being prepared as town.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
And right now most of the preparedness

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
is deeply flawed.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
And I hope I've convinced you of that,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160
which means that the real job is go out and

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
say to your local leaders,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
and your national leaders,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
"Why haven't you solved these problems?

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
Why are you still thinking that

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
the lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu?"

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.160
And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
But I guess the other thing to add is,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
if you do have employees, and you do have a company,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.160
I think you have certain responsibilities

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160
and you are trying to plan.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.160
At a minimum the British banking plan showed that

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
telecommuting can be helpful.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.160
It probably does reduce exposure

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.160
because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.160
or touching common objects

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.160
and sharing things via their hands.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.160
But can you sustain your company that way?

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
Well if you have a dot-com, maybe you can.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
Otherwise you're in trouble.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
Happy to take your questions.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.160
(Applause)

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.160
Audience member: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic?

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.160
Laurie Garret: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic, we don't really know.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.160
I could give you a bunch of flip, this, that, and the other.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
But I would say that honestly we don't know.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
Clearly the bottom line is

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
the virus eventually attenuates,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.160
and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
and finds other hosts.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160
But we don't really know how and why that happens.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.160
It's a very complicated ecology.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
Audience member: What kind of triggers are you looking for?

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
You know way more than any of us.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.160
To say ahh, if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic?

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160
LG: The moment that you see any evidence

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
of serious human-to-human to transmission.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
Not just intimately between family members

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.160
who took care of an ailing sister or brother,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.160
but a community infected --

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160
spread within a school,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
spread within a dormitory, something of that nature.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.160
Then I think that there is universal agreement

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160
now, at WHO all the way down:

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.160
Send out the alert.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.160
Audience member: Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.160
Can you talk about that?

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160
LG: Yeah. There is some evidence that taking Lipitor

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.160
and other common statins for cholesterol control

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.160
may decrease your vulnerability

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.160
to influenza.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.160
But we do not completely understand why.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160
The mechanism isn't clear.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.160
And I don't know that there is any way

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.160
responsibly for someone to start

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.160
medicating their children

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.160
with their personal supply of Lipitor or something of that nature.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160
We have absolutely no idea what that would do.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
You might be causing some very dangerous outcomes

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.160
in your children, doing such a thing.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160
Audience member: How far along are we in being able to determine

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.160
whether someone is actually carrying, whether somebody has this

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
before the symptoms are full-blown?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.160
LG: Right. So I have for a long time said

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.160
that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.160
And our Centers for Disease Control

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.160
has labeled a test they developed

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
a rapid diagnostic.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.160
It takes 24 hours in a very highly developed laboratory,

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
in highly skilled hands.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.160
I'm thinking dipstick.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
You could do it to your own kid. It changes color.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160
It tells you if you have H5N1.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.160
In terms of where we are in science

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.160
with DNA identification capacities and so on,

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.160
it's not that far off.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.160
But we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.160
Audience member: In the 1918 flu I understand that

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.160
they theorized that there was some attenuation

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.160
of the virus when it made the leap into humans.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
Is that likely, do you think, here?

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.160
I mean 100 percent death rate

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.160
is pretty severe.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.160
LG: Um yeah. So we don't actually know

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.160
what the lethality was

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.160
of the 1918 strain to wild birds

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.160
before it jumped from birds to humans.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.160
It's curious that there is no evidence

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.160
of mass die-offs of chickens

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.160
or household birds across America

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.160
before the human pandemic happened.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
That may be because those events

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.160
were occurring on the other side of the world

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.160
where nobody was paying attention.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.160
But the virus clearly

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.160
went through one round around the world

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.160
in a mild enough form

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.160
that the British army in World War I

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.160
actually certified that it was not a threat

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.160
and would not affect the outcome of the war.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.160
And after circulating around the world

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.160
came back in a form that was tremendously lethal.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.160
What percentage of infected people were killed by it?

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.160
Again we don't really know for sure.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.160
It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with,

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.160
you had a weakened immune system,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.160
you lived in poverty in India or Africa,

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.160
your likelihood of dying was far greater.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.160
But we don't really know.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.160
Audience member: One of the things I've heard is that

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.160
the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.160
and that a pneumonia vaccine

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.160
may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.160
LG: For a long time, researchers in emerging diseases

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.160
were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.160
on the grounds that

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.160
back in 1918 they didn't have antibiotics.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.160
And that most people who die of regular flu --

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.160
which in regular flu years

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.160
is about 360,000 people worldwide,

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.160
most of them senior citizens --

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.160
and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.160
And along comes pneumococcus

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.160
or another bacteria, streptococcus

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.160
and boom, they get a bacterial pneumonia.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.160
But it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.160
And so far in the H5N1 cases in people,

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.160
similarly bacterial infection

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.160
has not been an issue at all.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.160
It's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.160
that is the key to why people die of this virus.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.160
And I would just add

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.160
we saw the same thing with SARS.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.160
So what's going on here is your body says,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.160
your immune system sends out all its sentinels and says,

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.160
"I don't know what the heck this is.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.160
We've never seen anything even remotely like this before."

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.160
It won't do any good to bring in the sharpshooters

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.160
because those antibodies aren't here.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.160
And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.160
because those T-cells don't recognize it either.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.160
So we're going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response,

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.160
stimulate the total cytokine cascade.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.160
The whole immune system swarms into the lungs.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.160
And yes they die, drowning in their own fluids, of pneumonia.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.160
But it's not bacterial pneumonia.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.160
And it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.160
And I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.160
(Applause)
