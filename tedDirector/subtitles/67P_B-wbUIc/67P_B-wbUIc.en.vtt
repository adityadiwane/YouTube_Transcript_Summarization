Hello everyone.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.160
And so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160
And I'm going to be folding one of Robert Lang's models.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
And this is the piece of paper it will be made from,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
and you can see all of the folds that are needed for it.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.160
And Rufus is going to be doing some improvisation

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
on his custom, five-string electric cello,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
and it's very exciting to listen to him.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
Are you ready to go? OK.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
Just to make it a little bit more exciting.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
All right. Take it away, Rufus.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:02:40.160
(Music)

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
All right. There you go.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160
(Laughter)

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:53.160
(Applause)
