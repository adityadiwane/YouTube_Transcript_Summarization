00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.154
So this is a picture of my dad and me,
at the beach in Far Rockaway,

00:00:19.178 --> 00:00:20.640
or actually Rockaway Park.

00:00:20.664 --> 00:00:23.330
I'm the one with the blond hair.

00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:25.296
My dad's the guy with the cigarette.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.471
It was the 60's.

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:28.133
A lot of people smoked back then.

00:00:28.157 --> 00:00:31.674
In the summer of 2009,
my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.

00:00:34.302 --> 00:00:38.025
Cancer is one of those things
that actually touches everybody.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:40.677
If you're a man in the US,

00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:42.747
you've got about a one in two chance

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.706
of being diagnosed with cancer
during your lifetime.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.515
If you're a woman, you've got
about a one in three chance

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.208
of being diagnosed with cancer.

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:54.159
Everybody knows somebody
who's been diagnosed with cancer.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.935
Now, my dad's doing better today,

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:01.992
and part of the reason for that is that
he was able to participate in the trial

00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:05.249
of an experimental new drug
that happened to be specially formulated

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:07.526
and very good for his particular
kind of cancer.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.323
There are over 200 kinds of cancer.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.920
And what I want to talk about today

00:01:12.944 --> 00:01:15.816
is how we can help
more people like my dad,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.794
because we have to change the way
we think about raising money

00:01:18.818 --> 00:01:20.212
to fund cancer research.

00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:23.207
So a while after my dad was diagnosed,

00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:26.006
I was having coffee
with my friend Andrew Lo.

00:01:26.407 --> 00:01:29.673
He's the head of the Laboratory
for Financial Engineering at MIT,

00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:31.635
where I also have a position,

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.261
and we were talking about cancer.

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:35.679
And Andrew had been doing
his own bits of research,

00:01:35.703 --> 00:01:37.797
and one of the things
that he had been told

00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:42.266
and that he'd learned
from studying the literature

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.371
was that there's actually
a big bottleneck.

00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:46.535
It's very difficult to develop new drugs,

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:48.919
and the reason it's difficult
to develop new drugs

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:51.364
is because in the early stages
of drug development,

00:01:51.388 --> 00:01:53.893
the drugs are very risky,
and they're very expensive.

00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:56.790
So Andrew asked me
if I'd want to maybe work with him a bit,

00:01:56.814 --> 00:01:58.924
work on some of the math and the analytics

00:01:58.948 --> 00:02:01.485
and see if we could figure out
something we could do.

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:03.585
Now I'm not a scientist.

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.657
You know, I don't know
how to build a drug.

00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:10.576
And none of my coauthors, Andrew Lo
or Jose-Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan --

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.315
none of those guys are scientists either.

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.368
We don't know the first thing
about how to make a cancer drug.

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:19.027
But we know a little bit
about risk mitigation

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.167
and a little bit
about financial engineering,

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:23.299
and so we started thinking,
what could we do?

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.889
I'm going to tell you about some work

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:27.998
we've been doing
over the last couple years

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:30.293
that we think could
fundamentally change the way

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:33.190
research for cancer
and lots of other things gets done.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.139
We want to let the research
drive the funding,

00:02:36.163 --> 00:02:37.715
not the other way around.

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:39.740
So in order to get started,

00:02:39.764 --> 00:02:41.887
let me tell you
how you get a drug financed.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:46.312
Imagine that you're in your lab --
you're a scientist, you're not like me --

00:02:46.336 --> 00:02:48.308
and you've developed a new compound

00:02:48.332 --> 00:02:52.188
that you think might be therapeutic
for somebody with cancer.

00:02:52.212 --> 00:02:55.868
Well, what you do is, you test in animals,
you test in test tubes,

00:02:55.892 --> 00:02:58.952
but there's this notion
of going from the bench to the bedside,

00:02:58.976 --> 00:03:02.628
and in order to get from the bench,
the lab, to the bedside, to the patients,

00:03:02.652 --> 00:03:04.482
you've got to get the drug tested.

00:03:04.506 --> 00:03:06.110
And the way the drug gets tested

00:03:06.134 --> 00:03:08.355
is through a series of,
basically, experiments,

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.410
through these large,
they're called trials,

00:03:10.434 --> 00:03:12.789
that they do to determine
whether the drug is safe

00:03:12.813 --> 00:03:14.826
and whether it works and all these things.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.930
So the FDA has a very specific protocol.

00:03:16.954 --> 00:03:18.645
In the first phase of this testing,

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.278
which is called testing for toxicity,
it's called Phase I.

00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:25.369
In the first phase,
you give the drug to healthy people

00:03:25.393 --> 00:03:27.730
and you see if it actually
makes them sick.

00:03:28.578 --> 00:03:30.972
In other words, are the side
effects just so severe

00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:32.784
that no matter how much good it does,

00:03:32.808 --> 00:03:34.266
it's not going to be worth it?

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.981
Does it cause heart attacks,
kill people, liver failure?

00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:39.158
And it turns out,
that's a pretty high hurdle.

00:03:39.182 --> 00:03:41.544
About a third of all drugs
drop out at that point.

00:03:41.663 --> 00:03:44.522
In the next phase, you test
to see if the drug's effective,

00:03:44.546 --> 00:03:46.336
and you give it to people with cancer

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.091
and you see if it makes them better.

00:03:48.115 --> 00:03:50.433
And that's also a higher hurdle.
People drop out.

00:03:50.457 --> 00:03:53.263
And in the third phase,
you test it on a very large sample,

00:03:53.287 --> 00:03:56.395
and you're trying to determine
what the right dose is,

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.621
is it better than what's available today?
If not, then why build it?

00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:01.835
When you're done with all that,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.445
what you have is a very small
percentage of drugs

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:07.295
that start the process
actually come out the other side.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.033
So those blue bottles --
those blue bottles save lives,

00:04:11.057 --> 00:04:14.117
and they're also worth billions,
sometimes billions a year.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.375
So now here's a question:

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.641
if I were to ask you, for example,

00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:23.630
to make a one-time investment of, say,
200 million dollars

00:04:23.654 --> 00:04:25.298
to buy one of those bottles,

00:04:25.322 --> 00:04:28.674
so 200 million dollars up front, one time,
to buy one of those bottles,

00:04:28.698 --> 00:04:30.314
I won't tell you which one it is,

00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:34.239
and in 10 years, I'll tell you whether
you have one of the blue ones.

00:04:34.263 --> 00:04:36.394
Does that sound like a good
deal for anybody?

00:04:36.418 --> 00:04:37.656
No. No, right?

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.214
And of course, it's a very,
very risky trial position,

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.380
and that's why it's very hard
to get funding,

00:04:42.404 --> 00:04:45.200
but to a first approximation,
that's actually the proposal.

00:04:45.224 --> 00:04:47.834
You have to fund these things
from the early stages on.

00:04:47.858 --> 00:04:49.125
It takes a long time.

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:52.566
So Andrew said to me, he said,

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.036
"What if we stop thinking
about these as drugs?

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.846
What if we start thinking
about them as financial assets?"

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.514
They've got really weird payoff
structures and all that,

00:05:00.538 --> 00:05:03.878
but let's throw everything we know
about financial engineering at them.

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:06.362
Let's see if we can use
all the tricks of the trade

00:05:06.386 --> 00:05:09.733
to figure out how to make these drugs
work as financial assets.

00:05:10.344 --> 00:05:11.790
Let's create a giant fund.

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.033
In finance, we know what to do
with assets that are risky.

00:05:15.057 --> 00:05:18.169
You put them in a portfolio
and you try to smooth out the returns.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:21.236
So we did some math, and it turned out
you could make this work,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.692
but in order to make it work,
you need about 80 to 150 drugs.

00:05:24.716 --> 00:05:26.881
Now the good news is,
there's plenty of drugs

00:05:26.905 --> 00:05:28.365
that are waiting to be tested.

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.322
We've been told that there's a backlog
of about 20 years of drugs

00:05:32.346 --> 00:05:34.799
that are waiting to be tested
but can't be funded.

00:05:34.823 --> 00:05:37.220
In fact, that early stage
of the funding process,

00:05:37.244 --> 00:05:39.216
that Phase I and preclinical stuff,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.109
that's actually, in the industry,
called the Valley of Death

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:43.870
because it's where drugs go to die.

00:05:43.894 --> 00:05:46.148
It's very hard to for them
to get through there,

00:05:46.172 --> 00:05:48.399
and of course, if you can't
get through there,

00:05:48.423 --> 00:05:50.057
you can't get to the later stages.

00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:52.133
So we did this math,
and we figured out, OK,

00:05:52.157 --> 00:05:55.455
well, you need about 80 to, say, 150,
or something like that, drugs.

00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:58.553
And then we did a little more
math, and we said, OK,

00:05:58.577 --> 00:06:01.839
well, that's a fund of about three
to 15 billion dollars.

00:06:01.863 --> 00:06:05.347
So we kind of created a new problem
by solving the old one.

00:06:05.905 --> 00:06:08.588
We got rid of the risk,
but now we need a lot of capital,

00:06:08.612 --> 00:06:11.723
and you can only get that kind
of capital in the capital markets.

00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:14.240
Venture capitalists
and philanthropies don't have it.

00:06:14.264 --> 00:06:17.471
But we have to figure out
how to get people in the capital markets,

00:06:17.495 --> 00:06:20.987
who traditionally don't invest in this,
to want to invest in this stuff.

00:06:21.011 --> 00:06:23.329
So again, financial engineering
was helpful here.

00:06:23.353 --> 00:06:25.153
Imagine the megafund starts empty,

00:06:25.177 --> 00:06:29.186
and what it does is it issues
some debt and some equity,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.606
and that generates cash flow.

00:06:30.964 --> 00:06:34.709
That cash flow is used, then, to buy
that big portfolio of drugs that you need,

00:06:34.733 --> 00:06:38.046
and those drugs start working their way
through that approval process,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.461
and each time they go through
a phase of approval,

00:06:40.485 --> 00:06:41.680
they gain value.

00:06:41.704 --> 00:06:44.062
Most of them don't make it,
but a few of them do,

00:06:44.086 --> 00:06:46.592
and with the ones that gain
value, you can sell some,

00:06:46.616 --> 00:06:47.854
and when you sell them,

00:06:47.878 --> 00:06:50.216
you have money to pay
the interest on those bonds,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.291
but also to fund the next round of trials.

00:06:52.315 --> 00:06:53.540
It's almost self-funding.

00:06:53.564 --> 00:06:55.844
You do that for the course
of the transaction,

00:06:55.868 --> 00:06:58.297
and when you're done,
you liquidate the portfolio,

00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:01.643
pay back the bonds, and you can give
the equity holders a nice return.

00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:03.842
That was the theory,
and we talked about it,

00:07:03.866 --> 00:07:05.336
we did a bunch of experiments,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.528
and then we said,
let's really try to test it.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.436
We spent the next two years
doing research.

00:07:10.915 --> 00:07:15.283
We talked to hundreds of experts
in drug financing and venture capital.

00:07:15.721 --> 00:07:17.973
We talked to people
who have developed drugs.

00:07:17.997 --> 00:07:19.832
We talked to pharmaceutical companies.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:22.686
We actually looked at the data for drugs,

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.882
over 2,000 drugs that had been approved
or denied or withdrawn,

00:07:26.906 --> 00:07:29.257
and we also ran millions of simulations.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.760
And all that actually took a lot of time.

00:07:32.784 --> 00:07:36.077
But when we were done, we found something
that was sort of surprising.

00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:37.927
It was feasible to structure that fund

00:07:37.951 --> 00:07:40.043
such that when you were done
structuring it,

00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:44.006
you could actually produce low-risk bonds
that would be attractive to bond holders,

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.770
that would give you yields
of about five to eight percent,

00:07:46.794 --> 00:07:48.259
and you could produce equity

00:07:48.283 --> 00:07:50.978
that would give equity holders
about a 12 percent return.

00:07:51.002 --> 00:07:54.384
Now those returns aren't going
to be attractive to a venture capitalist.

00:07:54.408 --> 00:07:55.941
They want to make those big bets

00:07:55.965 --> 00:07:57.758
and get those billion dollar payoffs.

00:07:57.995 --> 00:08:01.433
But it turns out there are lots of other
folks that would be interested.

00:08:01.457 --> 00:08:05.036
That's right in the investment sweet spot
of pension funds and 401(k) plans

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.358
and all this other stuff.

00:08:06.687 --> 00:08:09.159
So we published some articles
in the academic press,

00:08:09.183 --> 00:08:13.998
in medical journals, in finance journals.

00:08:14.022 --> 00:08:17.467
But it wasn't until we actually
got the popular press interested in this

00:08:17.491 --> 00:08:19.696
that we began to get some traction.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.956
We wanted to do more
than just make people aware of it.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.560
We wanted people to get involved.

00:08:24.584 --> 00:08:27.697
So we took all of our computer code
and made that available online

00:08:27.721 --> 00:08:30.409
under an open-source license
to anybody that wanted it.

And you guys can download it today

00:08:32.152 --> 00:08:35.279
if you want to run your own experiments
to see if this would work.

00:08:35.303 --> 00:08:36.788
And that was really effective,

00:08:36.812 --> 00:08:39.176
because people that didn't
believe our assumptions

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.351
could try their own
and see how it would work.

00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:43.361
Now there's an obvious problem, which is,

00:08:43.385 --> 00:08:45.660
is there enough money
in the world to fund this?

00:08:45.684 --> 00:08:48.601
I've told you there's enough drugs,
but is there enough money?

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:50.531
There's 100 trillion dollars of capital

00:08:50.555 --> 00:08:53.549
currently invested
in fixed-income securities.

00:08:54.632 --> 00:08:56.465
That's a hundred thousand billion.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.927
There's plenty of money.

00:08:59.951 --> 00:09:02.957
(Laughter)

00:09:04.088 --> 00:09:06.831
But we realized it's more than
just money that's required.

00:09:06.855 --> 00:09:08.855
We had to get people motivated, involved,

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:10.529
and get them to understand this.

00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:14.310
And we started thinking about all
the different things that could go wrong.

00:09:14.334 --> 00:09:17.196
What are all the challenges
that might get in the way?

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.440
And we had a long list.

00:09:18.464 --> 00:09:21.443
We assigned a bunch of people,
including ourselves,

00:09:21.467 --> 00:09:23.053
different pieces of this problem.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.721
And we said, could you start
a work stream on credit risk?

00:09:26.745 --> 00:09:29.390
Could you start a work stream
on the regulatory aspects?

00:09:29.414 --> 00:09:33.447
Could you start a work stream
on how you would manage so many projects?

00:09:33.471 --> 00:09:37.143
And we had all these experts get together
and do these different work streams,

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:39.015
and then we held a conference.

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:41.269
The conference was held
over this past summer.

00:09:41.293 --> 00:09:43.073
It was an invitation-only conference.

00:09:43.097 --> 00:09:45.347
It was sponsored
by the American Cancer Society

00:09:45.371 --> 00:09:48.780
and done in collaboration
with the National Cancer Institute.

00:09:48.804 --> 00:09:51.762
We had experts from every field
we thought would be important,

00:09:51.786 --> 00:09:54.783
including the government, and people
that run research centers,

00:09:54.807 --> 00:09:57.244
and for two days they heard the reports

00:09:57.268 --> 00:09:59.860
from those five work streams,
and talked about it.

00:09:59.884 --> 00:10:02.722
It was the first time the people
who could make this happen

00:10:02.746 --> 00:10:05.813
sat across the table from each other
and had these conversations.

00:10:05.837 --> 00:10:09.334
Now these conferences,
it's typical to have a dinner,

00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:12.130
and at that dinner,
you get to know each other,

00:10:12.154 --> 00:10:13.895
sort of like what we're doing here.

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:15.565
I happened to look out the window,

00:10:15.589 --> 00:10:16.885
and hand on my heart,

00:10:16.909 --> 00:10:19.721
on the night of this conference --
it was the summertime --

00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:21.989
and that's what I saw, a double rainbow.

00:10:22.013 --> 00:10:23.956
So I'd like to think it was a good sign.

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:28.283
Since the conference, we've got people
working between Paris and San Francisco,

00:10:28.307 --> 00:10:30.176
lots of different folks working on this

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.651
to try to see if we can
really make it happen.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:36.335
We're not looking to start a fund,
but we want somebody else to do this.

00:10:36.359 --> 00:10:38.529
Because, again, I'm not a scientist.

00:10:38.553 --> 00:10:40.432
I can't build a drug.

00:10:40.456 --> 00:10:44.082
I'm never going to have enough money
to fund even one of those trials.

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:47.268
But all of us together, with our 401(k)s,

00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:49.860
with our 529 plans,
with our pension plans,

00:10:49.884 --> 00:10:52.767
all of us together can actually
fund hundreds of trials

00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:54.375
and get paid well for doing it

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:57.146
and save millions of lives like my dad.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.321
Thank you.

00:10:58.345 --> 00:11:03.920
(Applause)
