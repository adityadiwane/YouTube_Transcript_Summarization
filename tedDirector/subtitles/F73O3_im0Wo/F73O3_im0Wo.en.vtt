00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
This is my first trip,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
my first foreign trip as a first lady.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
Can you believe that?

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:34.330
(Applause)

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
And while this is not my first visit to the U.K.,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.330
I have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.330
The special relationship between the United States and the U.K.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.330
is based not only on the relationship between governments,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
but the common language and the values that we share,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
and I'm reminded of that by watching you all today.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.330
During my visit I've been especially honored

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
to meet some of Britain's most extraordinary women --

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
women who are paving the way for all of you.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
And I'm honored to meet you,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.330
the future leaders of Great Britain and this world.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.330
And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.330
with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.330
and you, just getting through school,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.330
I want you to know that we have very much in common.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.330
For nothing in my life's path

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
would have predicted that I'd be standing here

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
as the first African-American First Lady

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
of the United States of America.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.330
There is nothing in my story that would land me here.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
I wasn't raised with wealth or resources

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.330
or any social standing to speak of.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.330
I was raised on the South Side of Chicago.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
That's the real part of Chicago.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
And I was the product of a working-class community.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.330
My father was a city worker all of his life,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
and my mother was a stay-at-home mom.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.330
And she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
Neither of them attended university.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
in the prime of his life.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.330
But even as it got harder for him to walk

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
and get dressed in the morning --

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
I saw him struggle more and more --

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.330
my father never complained about his struggle.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
He was grateful for what he had.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.330
He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
And my brother and I were raised with all that you really need:

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
love, strong values

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
and a belief that with a good education

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
and a whole lot of hard work,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
that there was nothing that we could not do.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.330
I am an example of what's possible

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.330
when girls from the very beginning of their lives

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.330
are loved and nurtured by the people around them.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.330
I was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life:

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.330
grandmothers, teachers, aunts, cousins, neighbors,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.330
who taught me about quiet strength and dignity.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.330
And my mother, the most important role model in my life,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
who lives with us at the White House

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
and helps to care for our two little daughters,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
Malia and Sasha.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.330
She's an active presence in their lives, as well as mine,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
and is instilling in them

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
the same values that she taught me and my brother:

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
things like compassion, and integrity,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.330
and confidence, and perseverance --

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.330
all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.330
that only a grandmother can give.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.330
I was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.330
by some strong male role models as well,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
including my father, my brother, uncles and grandfathers.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.330
The men in my life taught me some important things, as well.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
They taught me about what a respectful relationship

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.330
should look like between men and women.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.330
They taught me about what a strong marriage feels like:

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.330
that it's built on faith and commitment

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.330
and an admiration for each other's unique gifts.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
They taught me about what it means

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
to be a father

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
and to raise a family.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
And not only to invest in your own home

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.330
but to reach out and help raise kids

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
in the broader community.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
And these were the same qualities

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
that I looked for in my own husband,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Barack Obama.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
And when we first met,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.330
one of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
And his date was to go with him to a community meeting.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
(Laughter)

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
I know, how romantic.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
(Laughter)

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
But when we met, Barack was a community organizer.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.330
He worked, helping people to find jobs

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.330
and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
As he talked to the residents in that community center,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
he talked about two concepts.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.330
He talked about "the world as it is" and "the world as it should be."

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.330
And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
What he said, that all too often,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.330
is that we accept the distance between those two ideas.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.330
And sometimes we settle for the world as it is,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.330
even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
But Barack reminded us on that day,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
all of us in that room, that we all know

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.330
what our world should look like.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
We all know.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
And he urged the people in that meeting,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
in that community,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
to devote themselves to closing the gap

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
between those two ideas,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.330
to work together to try to make the world as it is

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.330
and the world as it should be, one and the same.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.330
And I think about that today because I am

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.330
reminded and convinced that all of you in this school

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.330
are very important parts of closing that gap.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.330
You are the women who will build the world as it should be.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
You're going to write the next chapter in history.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.330
Not just for yourselves, but for your generation

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.330
and generations to come.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
And that's why getting a good education

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
is so important.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
That's why all of this that you're going through --

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.330
the ups and the downs, the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't --

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
why it's so important.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
Because communities and countries and ultimately the world

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.330
are only as strong as the health of their women.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
And that's important to keep in mind.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.330
Part of that health includes an outstanding education.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.330
The difference between a struggling family and a healthy one

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
is often the presence of an empowered woman

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
or women at the center of that family.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.330
The difference between a broken community and a thriving one

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.330
is often the healthy respect between men and women

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.330
who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
The difference between a languishing nation

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
and one that will flourish

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.330
is the recognition that we need equal access to education

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
for both boys and girls.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:59.330
And this school, named after the U.K.'s first female doctor,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:05.330
and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
Mary Seacole,

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.330
the Jamaican nurse known as the "black Florence Nightingale,"

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
and the English author, Emily Bronte,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.330
honor women who fought sexism, racism and ignorance,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.330
to pursue their passions to feed their own souls.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
They allowed for no obstacles.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.330
As the sign said back there, "without limitations."

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
They knew no other way to live

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
than to follow their dreams.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.330
And having done so, these women

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
moved many obstacles.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
And they opened many new doors

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.330
for millions of female doctors and nurses

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.330
and artists and authors,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
all of whom have followed them.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
And by getting a good education,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.330
you too can control your own destiny.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.330
Please remember that.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:06.330
If you want to know the reason why I'm standing here,

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
it's because of education.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.330
I never cut class. Sorry, I don't know if anybody is cutting class.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
I never did it.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
I loved getting As.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
I liked being smart.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.330
I liked being on time. I liked getting my work done.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.330
I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
And you too, with these same values,

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
can control your own destiny.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.330
You too can pave the way.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.330
You too can realize your dreams,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.330
and then your job is to reach back

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.330
and to help someone just like you do the same thing.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
History proves that it doesn't matter

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
whether you come from a council estate

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
or a country estate.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
Your success will be determined

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.330
by your own fortitude,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.330
your own confidence, your own individual hard work.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.330
That is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
You now have control over your own destiny.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:13.330
And it won't be easy -- that's for sure.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
But you have everything you need.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
Everything you need to succeed,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
you already have, right here.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.330
My husband works in this big office.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
They call it the Oval Office.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
In the White House, there's the desk that he sits at --

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.330
it's called the Resolute desk.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.330
It was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.330
and given by Queen Victoria.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:45.330
It's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
And its name, Resolute,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.330
is a reminder of the strength of character that's required

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
not only to lead a country,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.330
but to live a life of purpose, as well.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.330
And I hope in pursuing your dreams, you all remain resolute,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
that you go forward without limits,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:10.330
and that you use your talents -- because there are many; we've seen them;

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
it's there --

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.330
that you use them to create the world as it should be.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.330
Because we are counting on you.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
We are counting on every single one of you

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
to be the very best that you can be.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
Because the world is big.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.330
And it's full of challenges.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.330
