00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
The Highline

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
is an old, elevated rail line

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And it was originally a freight line

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
that ran down 10th Ave.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
And it became known as "Death Avenue"

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
because so many people were run over by the trains

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
and he became known as the "West Side Cowboy."

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
But even with a cowboy,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
about one person a month

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
was killed and run over.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
So they elevated it.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
They built it 30 ft. in the air, right through the middle of the city.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
But with the rise of interstate trucking,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
it was used less and less.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And by 1980, the last train rode.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys -- they say, at Thanksgiving --

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
from the meatpacking district.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And then it was abandoned.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And I live in the neighborhood,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and I first read about it in the New York Times,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
in an article that said it was going to be demolished.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And I assumed someone was working

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
to preserve it or save it

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
and I could volunteer,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
but I realized no one was doing anything.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
I went to my first community board meeting --

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
which I'd never been to one before --

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and sat next to another guy named Joshua David,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
who's a travel writer.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And at the end of the meeting, we realized

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project;

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
most people wanted to tear it down.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
So we exchanged business cards,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and we kept calling each other

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and decided to start this organization,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Friends of the High Line.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And the goal at first

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
was just saving it from demolition,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
And what first attracted me, or interested me,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
was this view from the street --

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
which is this steel structure,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
sort of rusty,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
this industrial relic.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
But when I went up on top,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
it was a mile and a half of wildflowers

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
running right through the middle of Manhattan

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
with views of the Empire State Building

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And that's really where we started,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
the idea coalesced around, let's make this a park,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and let's have it be sort of inspired

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
by this wildscape.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
At the time, there was a lot of opposition.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
I'm going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and a lot of community engagement.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Mayor Bloomberg came in office, he was very supportive,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
but we still had to make the economic case.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
This was after 9/11;

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
the city was in tough times.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
So we commissioned an economic feasibility study

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
to try to make the case.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And it turns out, we got those numbers wrong.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
We thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
So far it's cost about 150 million.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
And the main case was,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
this is going to make good economic sense for the city.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
So we said over a 20-year time period,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
the value to the city in increased property values

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and increased taxes

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
would be about 250 million.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
That was enough. It really got the city behind it.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
It turns out we were wrong on that.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Now people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
or will create about a half a billion dollars,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
in tax revenues for the city.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
We did a design competition,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
selected a design team.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
We worked with them to really create a design

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
that was inspired by that wildscape.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
There's three sections.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
We opened the fist section in 2009.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
It's been successful beyond our dreams.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Last year we had about two million people,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
which is about 10 times what we ever estimated.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
This is one of my favorite features in section one.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
It's this amphitheater right over 10th Ave.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And the first section ends at 20th St. right now.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
The other thing, it's generated, obviously, a lot of economic value;

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
it's also inspired, I think, a lot of great architecture.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
There's a point, you can stand here

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and see buildings by Frank Gehry,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Jean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Neil Denari.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And the Whitney is moving downtown

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And this has been designed by Renzo Piano.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And they're going to break ground in May.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And we've already started construction on section two.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
This is one of my favorite features,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
this flyover where you're eight feet

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
off the surface of the High Line,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
running through a canopy of trees.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
The High Line used to be covered in billboards,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and so we've taken a playful take

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
where, instead of framing advertisements,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
it's going to frame people in views of the city.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
This was just installed last month.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
which is the largest undeveloped site

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
in Manhattan.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
And the city has planned -- for better or for worse --

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
12 million square-feet of development

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
that the High Line is going to ring around.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
But what really, I think, makes the High Line special

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
is the people.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
And honestly, even though I love the designs that we were building,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
because I fell in love with that wildscape --

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
and how could you recreate that magic?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
But what I found

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
is it's in the people and how they use it

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
that, to me, makes it so special.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Just one quick example

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
is I realized right after we opened

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands;

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
we just don't do that outside.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
But you see that happening on the High Line,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and I think that's the power

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
that public space can have

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
to transform how people experience their city

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and interact with each other.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Thanks.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:35.260
(Applause)
