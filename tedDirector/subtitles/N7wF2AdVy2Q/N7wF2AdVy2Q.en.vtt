00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.376
Late in January 1975,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.816
a 17-year-old German girl
called Vera Brandes

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.480
walked out onto the stage
of the Cologne Opera House.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.320
The auditorium was empty.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.640
It was lit only by the dim, green glow
of the emergency exit sign.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.136
This was the most
exciting day of Vera's life.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.176
She was the youngest
concert promoter in Germany,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.616
and she had persuaded
the Cologne Opera House

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.976
to host a late-night concert of jazz

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.800
from the American musician, Keith Jarrett.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.816
1,400 people were coming.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.416
And in just a few hours,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.856
Jarrett would walk out on the same stage,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.216
he'd sit down at the piano

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.056
and without rehearsal or sheet music,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.360
he would begin to play.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.536
But right now,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.136
Vera was introducing Keith
to the piano in question,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.400
and it wasn't going well.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.776
Jarrett looked to the instrument
a little warily,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.336
played a few notes,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.575
walked around it,

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:18.056
played a few more notes,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.776
muttered something to his producer.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.120
Then the producer
came over to Vera and said ...

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.840
"If you don't get a new piano,
Keith can't play."

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.456
There'd been a mistake.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.856
The opera house had provided
the wrong instrument.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.536
This one had this harsh,
tinny upper register,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.840
because all the felt had worn away.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.776
The black notes were sticking,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.696
the white notes were out of tune,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.376
the pedals didn't work

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.576
and the piano itself was just too small.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.016
It wouldn't create the volume

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.960
that would fill a large space
such as the Cologne Opera House.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.560
So Keith Jarrett left.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.240
He went and sat outside in his car,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.976
leaving Vera Brandes

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.640
to get on the phone
to try to find a replacement piano.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.296
Now she got a piano tuner,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.920
but she couldn't get a new piano.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.856
And so she went outside

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.480
and she stood there in the rain,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.720
talking to Keith Jarrett,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.080
begging him not to cancel the concert.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.576
And he looked out of his car

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.280
at this bedraggled,
rain-drenched German teenager,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.056
took pity on her,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.280
and said,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.160
"Never forget ... only for you."

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.896
And so a few hours later,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.360
Jarrett did indeed step out
onto the stage of the opera house,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.560
he sat down at the unplayable piano

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.800
and began.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.640
(Music)

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.056
Within moments it became clear
that something magical was happening.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.656
Jarrett was avoiding
those upper registers,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.296
he was sticking to the middle
tones of the keyboard,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.936
which gave the piece
a soothing, ambient quality.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.496
But also, because the piano was so quiet,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.936
he had to set up these rumbling,
repetitive riffs in the bass.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.216
And he stood up twisting,
pounding down on the keys,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.856
desperately trying to create enough volume
to reach the people in the back row.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.896
It's an electrifying performance.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.856
It somehow has this peaceful quality,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.936
and at the same time it's full of energy,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.160
it's dynamic.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.439
And the audience loved it.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.216
Audiences continue to love it

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.336
because the recording of the KÃ¶ln Concert

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.856
is the best-selling piano album in history

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.480
and the best-selling
solo jazz album in history.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.320
Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.120
He had embraced that mess, and it soared.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.336
But let's think for a moment
about Jarrett's initial instinct.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.936
He didn't want to play.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.176
Of course,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.136
I think any of us,
in any remotely similar situation,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.736
would feel the same way,
we'd have the same instinct.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.055
We don't want to be asked
to do good work with bad tools.

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:32.720
We don't want to have to overcome
unnecessary hurdles.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.920
But Jarrett's instinct was wrong,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.160
and thank goodness he changed his mind.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.640
And I think our instinct is also wrong.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.216
I think we need to gain
a bit more appreciation

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.280
for the unexpected advantages
of having to cope with a little mess.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.696
So let me give you some examples

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.176
from cognitive psychology,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.616
from complexity science,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.096
from social psychology,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.760
and of course, rock 'n' roll.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.736
So cognitive psychology first.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.576
We've actually known for a while

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.936
that certain kinds of difficulty,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.536
certain kinds of obstacle,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.322
can actually improve our performance.

00:05:15.346 --> 00:05:17.056
For example,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.816
the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.056
a few years ago,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.136
teamed up with high school teachers.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.896
And he asked them to reformat the handouts

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.280
that they were giving
to some of their classes.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.534
So the regular handout would be formatted
in something straightforward,

00:05:31.558 --> 00:05:33.998
such as Helvetica or Times New Roman.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.856
But half these classes were getting
handouts that were formatted

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.576
in something sort of intense,
like Haettenschweiler,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.616
or something with a zesty bounce,
like Comic Sans italicized.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.456
Now, these are really ugly fonts,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.656
and they're difficult fonts to read.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.776
But at the end of the semester,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.416
students were given exams,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.096
and the students who'd been asked
to read the more difficult fonts,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.176
had actually done better on their exams,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.736
in a variety of subjects.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.776
And the reason is,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.336
the difficult font had slowed them down,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.416
forced them to work a bit harder,

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.016
to think a bit more
about what they were reading,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.280
to interpret it ...

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.560
and so they learned more.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.520
Another example.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.856
The psychologist Shelley Carson
has been testing Harvard undergraduates

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.856
for the quality
of their attentional filters.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.256
What do I mean by that?

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.496
What I mean is,
imagine you're in a restaurant,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.256
you're having a conversation,

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.416
there are all kinds of other conversations
going on in the restaurant,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.776
you want to filter them out,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.936
you want to focus
on what's important to you.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.176
Can you do that?

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.176
If you can, you have
good, strong attentional filters.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.256
But some people really struggle with that.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.016
Some of Carson's undergraduate
subjects struggled with that.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.976
They had weak filters,
they had porous filters --

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.376
let a lot of external information in.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.536
And so what that meant is they were
constantly being interrupted

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.136
by the sights and the sounds
of the world around them.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.216
If there was a television on
while they were doing their essays,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.656
they couldn't screen it out.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.109
Now, you would think
that that was a disadvantage ...

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.696
but no.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.696
When Carson looked at what
these students had achieved,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.496
the ones with the weak filters

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.936
were vastly more likely

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.736
to have some real
creative milestone in their lives,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.096
to have published their first novel,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.800
to have released their first album.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.896
These distractions were actually
grists to their creative mill.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.760
They were able to think outside the box
because their box was full of holes.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.936
Let's talk about complexity science.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.818
So how do you solve a really complex --

00:07:39.842 --> 00:07:41.856
the world's full
of complicated problems --

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.056
how do you solve
a really complicated problem?

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.216
For example, you try to make a jet engine.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.456
There are lots and lots
of different variables,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.433
the operating temperature, the materials,

00:07:50.457 --> 00:07:52.896
all the different dimensions, the shape.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.456
You can't solve that kind
of problem all in one go,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.696
it's too hard.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.936
So what do you do?

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.896
Well, one thing you can do
is try to solve it step-by-step.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.616
So you have some kind of prototype

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.056
and you tweak it,
you test it, you improve it.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.880
You tweak it, you test it, you improve it.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.536
Now, this idea of marginal gains
will eventually get you a good jet engine.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.856
And it's been quite widely
implemented in the world.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.376
So you'll hear about it, for example,
in high performance cycling,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.696
web designers will talk about trying
to optimize their web pages,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.016
they're looking
for these step-by-step gains.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.880
That's a good way
to solve a complicated problem.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.880
But you know what would
make it a better way?

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.800
A dash of mess.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.336
You add randomness,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.736
early on in the process,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.256
you make crazy moves,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.655
you try stupid things that shouldn't work,

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:52.696
and that will tend to make
the problem-solving work better.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.256
And the reason for that is

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.336
the trouble with the step-by-step process,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.576
the marginal gains,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.136
is they can walk you
gradually down a dead end.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.376
And if you start with the randomness,
that becomes less likely,

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.800
and your problem-solving
becomes more robust.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.120
Let's talk about social psychology.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.816
So the psychologist Katherine Phillips,
with some colleagues,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.896
recently gave murder mystery
problems to some students,

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.776
and these students
were collected in groups of four

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.136
and they were given dossiers
with information about a crime --

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.040
alibis and evidence,
witness statements and three suspects.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.176
And the groups of four students
were asked to figure out who did it,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.400
who committed the crime.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.680
And there were two treatments
in this experiment.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.976
In some cases these were four friends,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.560
they all knew each other well.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.936
In other cases,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.880
three friends and a stranger.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.096
And you can see where I'm going with this.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.376
Obviously I'm going to say

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.816
that the groups with the stranger
solved the problem more effectively,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.120
which is true, they did.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.296
Actually, they solved the problem
quite a lot more effectively.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.200
So the groups of four friends,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.096
they only had a 50-50 chance
of getting the answer right.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.816
Which is actually not that great --

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.776
in multiple choice, for three answers?
50-50's not good.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.976
(Laughter)

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.696
The three friends and the stranger,

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.536
even though the stranger
didn't have any extra information,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.096
even though it was just a case

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:28.416
of how that changed the conversation
to accommodate that awkwardness,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.136
the three friends and the stranger,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.826
they had a 75 percent chance
of finding the right answer.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.576
That's quite a big leap in performance.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.936
But I think what's really interesting

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.199
is not just that the three friends
and the stranger did a better job,

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.663
but how they felt about it.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.336
So when Katherine Phillips
interviewed the groups of four friends,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.216
they had a nice time,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.200
they also thought they'd done a good job.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.920
They were complacent.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.296
When she spoke to the three
friends and the stranger,

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.816
they had not had a nice time --

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.440
it's actually rather difficult,
it's rather awkward ...

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.720
and they were full of doubt.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.120
They didn't think they'd done a good job
even though they had.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.816
And I think that really exemplifies

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.080
the challenge that we're
dealing with here.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.496
Because, yeah --

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.376
the ugly font,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.176
the awkward stranger,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.520
the random move ...

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.656
these disruptions help us solve problems,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.016
they help us become more creative.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.096
But we don't feel that they're helping us.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.160
We feel that they're
getting in the way ...

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.240
and so we resist.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.440
And that's why the last example
is really important.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.576
So I want to talk about somebody

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.536
from the background
of the world of rock 'n' roll.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.456
And you may know him,
he's actually a TED-ster.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.856
His name is Brian Eno.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.696
He is an ambient composer --
rather brilliant.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.400
He's also a kind of catalyst

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.176
behind some of the great
rock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.816
He's worked with David Bowie on "Heroes,"

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.976
he worked with U2 on "Achtung Baby"
and "The Joshua Tree,"

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.536
he's worked with DEVO,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.136
he's worked with Coldplay,
he's worked with everybody.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.080
And what does he do to make
these great rock bands better?

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.960
Well, he makes a mess.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.656
He disrupts their creative processes.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.776
It's his role to be the awkward stranger.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.216
It's his role to tell them

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.416
that they have to play
the unplayable piano.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.096
And one of the ways
in which he creates this disruption

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.080
is through this remarkable
deck of cards --

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.240
I have my signed copy here --
thank you, Brian.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.416
They're called The Oblique Strategies,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.298
he developed them with a friend of his.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.840
And when they're stuck in the studio,

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.176
Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.656
He'll draw one at random,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.936
and he'll make the band
follow the instructions on the card.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.280
So this one ...

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.336
"Change instrument roles."

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.075
Yeah, everyone swap instruments --
Drummer on the piano --

00:13:01.099 --> 00:13:03.096
Brilliant, brilliant idea.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.800
"Look closely at the most 
embarrassing details. Amplify them."

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.080
"Make a sudden, destructive,
unpredictable action. Incorporate."

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.320
These cards are disruptive.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.720
Now, they've proved their worth
in album after album.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.176
The musicians hate them.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.696
(Laughter)

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.136
So Phil Collins was playing drums
on an early Brian Eno album.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.160
He got so frustrated he started
throwing beer cans across the studio.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.776
Carlos Alomar, great rock guitarist,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.576
working with Eno
on David Bowie's "Lodger" album,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.176
and at one point
he turns to Brian and says,

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.680
"Brian, this experiment is stupid."

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.120
But the thing is
it was a pretty good album,

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.320
but also,

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.856
Carlos Alomar, 35 years later,
now uses The Oblique Strategies.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.616
And he tells his students
to use The Oblique Strategies

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.360
because he's realized something.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.880
Just because you don't like it
doesn't mean it isn't helping you.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.762
The strategies actually
weren't a deck of cards originally,

00:14:14.786 --> 00:14:15.976
they were just a list --

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.816
list on the recording studio wall.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.640
A checklist of things
you might try if you got stuck.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.480
The list didn't work.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.360
Know why?

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.600
Not messy enough.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.696
Your eye would go down the list

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.776
and it would settle on whatever
was the least disruptive,

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.000
the least troublesome,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.360
which of course misses the point entirely.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.536
And what Brian Eno came to realize was,

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.056
yes, we need to run
the stupid experiments,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.136
we need to deal
with the awkward strangers,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.296
we need to try to read the ugly fonts.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.576
These things help us.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.976
They help us solve problems,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.896
they help us be more creative.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.120
But also ...

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.520
we really need some persuasion
if we're going to accept this.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.440
So however we do it ...

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.456
whether it's sheer willpower,

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.560
whether it's the flip of a card

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.760
or whether it's a guilt trip
from a German teenager,

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.816
all of us, from time to time,

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.280
need to sit down and try and play
the unplayable piano.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.856
Thank you.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.760
(Applause)
