00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.419
So, imagine that you had
your smartphone miniaturized

00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:18.803
and hooked up directly to your brain.

00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:21.604
If you had this sort of brain chip,

00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:24.159
you'd be able to upload
and download to the internet

00:00:24.183 --> 00:00:25.375
at the speed of thought.

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:29.253
Accessing social media or Wikipedia
would be a lot like --

00:00:29.277 --> 00:00:30.917
well, from the inside at least --

00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:32.691
like consulting your own memory.

00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:36.445
It would be as easy
and as intimate as thinking.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.736
But would it make it easier
for you to know what's true?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.721
Just because a way
of accessing information is faster

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:45.990
it doesn't mean it's more
reliable, of course,

00:00:46.014 --> 00:00:49.245
and it doesn't mean that we would all
interpret it the same way.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.863
And it doesn't mean that you would be
any better at evaluating it.

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:54.544
In fact, you might even be worse,

00:00:54.568 --> 00:00:57.350
because, you know, more data,
less time for evaluation.

00:00:58.378 --> 00:01:01.773
Something like this is already
happening to us right now.

00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:05.655
We already carry a world of information
around in our pockets,

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:09.908
but it seems as if the more information
we share and access online,

00:01:09.932 --> 00:01:12.734
the more difficult it can be for us
to tell the difference

00:01:12.758 --> 00:01:14.875
between what's real and what's fake.

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:19.445
It's as if we know more
but understand less.

00:01:20.152 --> 00:01:23.089
Now, it's a feature
of modern life, I suppose,

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:27.101
that large swaths of the public
live in isolated information bubbles.

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:32.503
We're polarized: not just over values,
but over the facts.

00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:36.124
One reason for that is, the data
analytics that drive the internet

00:01:36.148 --> 00:01:38.547
get us not just more information,

00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:40.757
but more of the information that we want.

00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:43.171
Our online life is personalized;

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:44.925
everything from the ads we read

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:47.539
to the news that comes down
our Facebook feed

00:01:47.563 --> 00:01:50.569
is tailored to satisfy our preferences.

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:53.085
And so while we get more information,

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.339
a lot of that information ends up
reflecting ourselves

00:01:56.363 --> 00:01:58.567
as much as it does reality.

00:01:59.198 --> 00:02:00.837
It ends up, I suppose,

00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:04.224
inflating our bubbles
rather than bursting them.

00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:07.460
And so maybe it's no surprise

00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:10.389
that we're in a situation,
a paradoxical situation,

00:02:10.413 --> 00:02:12.544
of thinking that we know so much more,

00:02:12.568 --> 00:02:15.578
and yet not agreeing
on what it is we know.

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.831
So how are we going to solve
this problem of knowledge polarization?

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:25.023
One obvious tactic is to try
to fix our technology,

00:02:25.047 --> 00:02:26.956
to redesign our digital platforms,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.123
so as to make them less
susceptible to polarization.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:32.083
And I'm happy to report

00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:36.747
that many smart people at Google
and Facebook are working on just that.

00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:38.360
And these projects are vital.

00:02:39.837 --> 00:02:42.967
I think that fixing technology
is obviously really important,

00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:47.613
but I don't think technology alone,
fixing it, is going to solve the problem

00:02:47.637 --> 00:02:48.991
of knowledge polarization.

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:52.090
I don't think that because I don't think,
at the end of the day,

00:02:52.114 --> 00:02:53.743
it is a technological problem.

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:55.642
I think it's a human problem,

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:59.231
having to do with how we think
and what we value.

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:02.900
In order to solve it, I think
we're going to need help.

00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:05.929
We're going to need help
from psychology and political science.

00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:09.203
But we're also going to need help,
I think, from philosophy.

00:03:10.663 --> 00:03:14.191
Because to solve the problem
of knowledge polarization,

00:03:15.522 --> 00:03:17.517
we're going to need to reconnect

00:03:18.455 --> 00:03:22.291
with one fundamental, philosophical idea:

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.616
that we live in a common reality.

00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:30.698
The idea of a common reality
is like, I suppose,

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:32.285
a lot of philosophical concepts:

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:33.475
easy to state

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:36.134
but mysteriously difficult
to put into practice.

00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:38.308
To really accept it,

00:03:38.332 --> 00:03:40.549
I think we need to do three things,

00:03:40.573 --> 00:03:42.885
each of which is a challenge right now.

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.313
First, we need to believe in truth.

00:03:48.267 --> 00:03:49.430
You might have noticed

00:03:49.454 --> 00:03:52.469
that our culture is having
something of a troubled relationship

00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:53.894
with that concept right now.

00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:58.274
It seems as if we disagree so much that,

00:03:58.298 --> 00:04:01.107
as one political commentator
put it not long ago,

00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:03.366
it's as if there are no facts anymore.

00:04:04.986 --> 00:04:09.208
But that thought is actually an expression

00:04:09.232 --> 00:04:13.241
of a sort of seductive line
of argument that's in the air.

00:04:13.668 --> 00:04:14.936
It goes like this:

00:04:16.188 --> 00:04:19.039
we just can't step outside
of our own perspectives;

00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:21.505
we can't step outside of our biases.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.002
Every time we try,

00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:26.611
we just get more information
from our perspective.

00:04:27.536 --> 00:04:29.786
So, this line of thought goes,

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:34.778
we might as well admit
that objective truth is an illusion,

00:04:34.802 --> 00:04:35.956
or it doesn't matter,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.126
because either we'll never
know what it is,

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.182
or it doesn't exist in the first place.

00:04:43.173 --> 00:04:46.169
That's not a new philosophical thought --

00:04:46.193 --> 00:04:48.041
skepticism about truth.

00:04:49.332 --> 00:04:52.213
During the end of the last century,
as some of you know,

00:04:52.237 --> 00:04:54.531
it was very popular in certain
academic circles.

00:04:55.317 --> 00:05:00.450
But it really goes back all the way
to the Greek philosopher Protagoras,

00:05:00.474 --> 00:05:01.800
if not farther back.

00:05:02.252 --> 00:05:04.701
Protagoras said that objective
truth was an illusion

00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:07.632
because "man is the measure
of all things."

00:05:07.656 --> 00:05:09.596
Man is the measure of all things.

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.992
That can seem like a bracing bit
of realpolitik to people,

00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:14.175
or liberating,

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.737
because it allows each of us
to discover or make our own truth.

00:05:20.618 --> 00:05:24.780
But actually, I think it's a bit
of self-serving rationalization

00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:26.671
disguised as philosophy.

00:05:27.507 --> 00:05:30.315
It confuses the difficulty
of being certain

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:32.984
with the impossibility of truth.

00:05:34.223 --> 00:05:35.429
Look --

00:05:36.768 --> 00:05:39.708
of course it's difficult
to be certain about anything;

00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:43.221
we might all be living in "The Matrix."

00:05:44.018 --> 00:05:46.000
You might have a brain chip in your head

00:05:46.024 --> 00:05:47.988
feeding you all the wrong information.

00:05:49.593 --> 00:05:53.772
But in practice, we do agree
on all sorts of facts.

00:05:53.796 --> 00:05:57.035
We agree that bullets can kill people.

00:05:57.616 --> 00:06:01.999
We agree that you can't flap
your arms and fly.

00:06:02.023 --> 00:06:04.132
We agree -- or we should --

00:06:05.018 --> 00:06:07.315
that there is an external reality

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:09.420
and ignoring it can get you hurt.

00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:15.354
Nonetheless, skepticism
about truth can be tempting,

00:06:15.378 --> 00:06:18.692
because it allows us to rationalize
away our own biases.

00:06:18.716 --> 00:06:21.703
When we do that, we're sort of like
the guy in the movie

00:06:21.727 --> 00:06:24.065
who knew he was living in "The Matrix"

00:06:24.793 --> 00:06:27.518
but decided he liked it there, anyway.

00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:31.689
After all, getting what you
want feels good.

00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:34.967
Being right all the time feels good.

00:06:34.991 --> 00:06:37.773
So, often it's easier for us

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:41.286
to wrap ourselves in our cozy
information bubbles,

00:06:42.049 --> 00:06:43.590
live in bad faith,

00:06:43.614 --> 00:06:47.365
and take those bubbles
as the measure of reality.

00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:54.440
An example, I think, of how
this bad faith gets into our action

00:06:54.464 --> 00:06:59.249
is our reaction
to the phenomenon of fake news.

00:06:59.874 --> 00:07:02.804
The fake news that spread on the internet

00:07:02.828 --> 00:07:07.482
during the American
presidential election of 2016

00:07:07.506 --> 00:07:10.133
was designed to feed into our biases,

00:07:10.157 --> 00:07:12.271
designed to inflate our bubbles.

00:07:12.295 --> 00:07:14.346
But what was really striking about it

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.984
was not just that it fooled
so many people.

00:07:17.595 --> 00:07:20.436
What was really striking to me
about fake news,

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.798
the phenomenon,

00:07:21.822 --> 00:07:26.877
is how quickly it itself became
the subject of knowledge polarization;

00:07:27.582 --> 00:07:31.261
so much so, that the very term --
the very term -- "fake news"

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:34.689
now just means: "news story I don't like."

00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:40.240
That's an example of the bad faith
towards the truth that I'm talking about.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.714
But the really, I think, dangerous thing

00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:50.559
about skepticism with regard to truth

00:07:51.476 --> 00:07:53.383
is that it leads to despotism.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.273
"Man is the measure of all things"

00:07:57.297 --> 00:08:01.214
inevitably becomes "The Man
is the measure of all things."

00:08:01.852 --> 00:08:04.502
Just as "every man for himself"

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:07.521
always seems to turn out to be
"only the strong survive."

00:08:08.345 --> 00:08:10.834
At the end of Orwell's "1984,"

00:08:12.136 --> 00:08:16.395
the thought policeman O'Brien is torturing
the protagonist Winston Smith

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:19.617
into believing two plus two equals five.

00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:23.375
What O'Brien says is the point,

00:08:25.486 --> 00:08:29.907
is that he wants to convince Smith
that whatever the party says is the truth,

00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:32.816
and the truth is whatever the party says.

00:08:33.484 --> 00:08:37.004
And what O'Brien knows
is that once this thought is accepted,

00:08:38.387 --> 00:08:40.941
critical dissent is impossible.

00:08:41.857 --> 00:08:44.045
You can't speak truth to power

00:08:44.069 --> 00:08:47.224
if the power speaks truth by definition.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.123
I said that in order to accept
that we really live in a common reality,

00:08:53.147 --> 00:08:54.434
we have to do three things.

00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:56.443
The first thing is to believe in truth.

00:08:56.467 --> 00:08:58.137
The second thing can be summed up

00:08:58.161 --> 00:09:03.247
by the Latin phrase that Kant took
as the motto for the Enlightenment:

00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.908
"Sapere aude,"

00:09:04.932 --> 00:09:06.664
or "dare to know."

00:09:06.688 --> 00:09:09.114
Or as Kant wants,
"to dare to know for yourself."

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:12.250
I think in the early days of the internet,

00:09:12.274 --> 00:09:13.440
a lot of us thought

00:09:13.464 --> 00:09:17.274
that information technology
was always going to make it easier

00:09:17.298 --> 00:09:19.153
for us to know for ourselves,

00:09:19.177 --> 00:09:21.869
and of course in many ways, it has.

00:09:21.893 --> 00:09:25.731
But as the internet has become
more and more a part of our lives,

00:09:25.755 --> 00:09:27.714
our reliance on it, our use of it,

00:09:27.738 --> 00:09:30.298
has become often more passive.

00:09:30.322 --> 00:09:32.687
Much of what we know today we Google-know.

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:36.994
We download prepackaged sets of facts

00:09:37.018 --> 00:09:40.830
and sort of shuffle them along
the assembly line of social media.

00:09:41.357 --> 00:09:42.787
Now, Google-knowing is useful

00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:46.007
precisely because it involves
a sort of intellectual outsourcing.

00:09:46.031 --> 00:09:51.796
We offload our effort onto a network
of others and algorithms.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.827
And that allows us, of course,
to not clutter our minds

00:09:54.851 --> 00:09:56.290
with all sorts of facts.

00:09:56.314 --> 00:09:58.601
We can just download them
when we need them.

00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:00.007
And that's awesome.

00:10:01.348 --> 00:10:06.129
But there's a difference
between downloading a set of facts

00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:11.635
and really understanding how or why
those facts are as they are.

00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:17.611
Understanding why
a particular disease spreads,

00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:19.694
or how a mathematical proof works,

00:10:19.718 --> 00:10:21.731
or why your friend is depressed,

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:24.220
involves more than just downloading.

00:10:25.396 --> 00:10:27.477
It's going to require, most likely,

00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:29.603
doing some work for yourself:

00:10:30.503 --> 00:10:32.343
having a little creative insight;

00:10:32.367 --> 00:10:33.633
using your imagination;

00:10:33.657 --> 00:10:34.975
getting out into the field;

00:10:34.999 --> 00:10:36.181
doing the experiment;

00:10:36.205 --> 00:10:37.476
working through the proof;

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.944
talking to someone.

00:10:43.533 --> 00:10:47.077
Now, I'm not saying, of course,
that we should stop Google-knowing.

00:10:48.402 --> 00:10:49.553
I'm just saying

00:10:49.577 --> 00:10:51.263
we shouldn't overvalue it, either.

00:10:51.287 --> 00:10:55.951
We need to find ways of encouraging
forms of knowing that are more active,

00:10:56.512 --> 00:11:01.561
and don't always involve passing off
our effort into our bubble.

00:11:02.242 --> 00:11:05.583
Because the thing about Google-knowing
is that too often it ends up

00:11:05.607 --> 00:11:06.971
being bubble-knowing.

00:11:07.581 --> 00:11:10.371
And bubble-knowing means
always being right.

00:11:11.183 --> 00:11:13.380
But daring to know,

00:11:13.404 --> 00:11:14.974
daring to understand,

00:11:16.151 --> 00:11:19.217
means risking the possibility
that you could be wrong.

00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:22.189
It means risking the possibility

00:11:22.213 --> 00:11:26.540
that what you want and what's true
are different things.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.991
Which brings me to the third thing
that I think we need to do

00:11:31.854 --> 00:11:34.886
if we want to accept that we live
in a common reality.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.801
That third thing is:
have a little humility.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.632
By humility here, I mean
epistemic humility,

00:11:40.656 --> 00:11:42.645
which means, in a sense,

00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:46.104
knowing that you don't know it all.

00:11:46.128 --> 00:11:48.181
But it also means something
more than that.

00:11:48.205 --> 00:11:52.655
It means seeing your worldview
as open to improvement

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:54.810
by the evidence and experience of others.

00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:56.883
Seeing your worldview
as open to improvement

00:11:56.907 --> 00:11:59.030
by the evidence and experience of others.

00:12:00.084 --> 00:12:02.123
That's more than just
being open to change.

00:12:02.147 --> 00:12:04.545
It's more than just being open
to self-improvement.

00:12:04.569 --> 00:12:08.854
It means seeing your knowledge
as capable of enhancing

00:12:08.878 --> 00:12:11.404
or being enriched
by what others contribute.

00:12:12.224 --> 00:12:14.938
That's part of what is involved

00:12:14.962 --> 00:12:17.095
in recognizing there's a common reality

00:12:18.116 --> 00:12:19.969
that you, too, are responsible to.

00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:23.838
I don't think it's much
of a stretch to say

00:12:23.862 --> 00:12:28.817
that our society is not particularly great
at enhancing or encouraging

00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:30.056
that sort of humility.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.659
That's partly because,

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.798
well, we tend to confuse
arrogance and confidence.

00:12:36.263 --> 00:12:38.704
And it's partly because, well, you know,

00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:40.894
arrogance is just easier.

00:12:40.918 --> 00:12:43.595
It's just easier to think of yourself
as knowing it all.

00:12:43.619 --> 00:12:47.316
It's just easier to think of yourself
as having it all figured out.

00:12:48.513 --> 00:12:51.446
But that's another example
of the bad faith towards the truth

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.008
that I've been talking about.

00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:57.628
So the concept of a common reality,

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.342
like a lot of philosophical concepts,

00:13:00.366 --> 00:13:01.850
can seem so obvious,

00:13:02.785 --> 00:13:04.627
that we can look right past it

00:13:05.945 --> 00:13:07.929
and forget why it's important.

00:13:09.394 --> 00:13:14.338
Democracies can't function
if their citizens don't strive,

00:13:14.362 --> 00:13:15.732
at least some of the time,

00:13:15.756 --> 00:13:17.437
to inhabit a common space,

00:13:17.461 --> 00:13:20.917
a space where they can pass
ideas back and forth

00:13:22.123 --> 00:13:23.909
when -- and especially when --

00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:25.338
they disagree.

00:13:25.749 --> 00:13:28.013
But you can't strive to inhabit that space

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.146
if you don't already accept
that you live in the same reality.

00:13:35.144 --> 00:13:37.315
To accept that, we've got
to believe in truth,

00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:40.650
we've got to encourage
more active ways of knowing.

00:13:41.394 --> 00:13:43.132
And we've got to have the humility

00:13:44.271 --> 00:13:46.978
to realize that we're not
the measure of all things.

00:13:49.049 --> 00:13:52.573
We may yet one day realize the vision

00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:55.270
of having the internet in our brains.

00:13:56.545 --> 00:14:00.464
But if we want that to be liberating
and not terrifying,

00:14:00.488 --> 00:14:03.250
if we want it to expand our understanding

00:14:03.274 --> 00:14:05.677
and not just our passive knowing,

00:14:06.585 --> 00:14:10.224
we need to remember that our perspectives,

00:14:10.248 --> 00:14:13.399
as wondrous, as beautiful as they are,

00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:15.451
are just that --

00:14:15.475 --> 00:14:17.995
perspectives on one reality.

00:14:19.096 --> 00:14:20.367
Thank you.

00:14:20.391 --> 00:14:25.217
(Applause)
