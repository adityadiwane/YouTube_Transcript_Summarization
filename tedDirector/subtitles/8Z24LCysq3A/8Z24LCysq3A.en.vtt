Reviewer: Morton Bast

00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:21.002
This is the skyline
of my hometown, New Orleans.

00:00:21.026 --> 00:00:23.639
It was a great place to grow up,

00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:27.374
but it's one of the most vulnerable
spots in the world.

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:30.081
Half the city is already below sea level.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:33.533
In 2005, the world watched as New Orleans

00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:37.036
and the Gulf Coast were
devastated by Hurricane Katrina.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.246
One thousand, eight hundred and thirty-six
people died. Nearly 300,000 homes were lost.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.517
These are my mother's, at the top --

00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:46.971
although that's not her car,

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:49.519
it was carried there
by floodwaters up to the roof --

00:00:49.543 --> 00:00:51.617
and that's my sister's, below.

00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:55.469
Fortunately, they and other
family members got out in time,

00:00:55.493 --> 00:00:57.684
but they lost their homes,
and as you can see,

00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:00.534
just about everything in them.

00:01:00.558 --> 00:01:02.844
Other parts of the world
have been hit by storms

00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:04.828
in even more devastating ways.

00:01:04.852 --> 00:01:07.706
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.048
killed 138,000 in Myanmar.

00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:14.480
Climate change is affecting
our homes, our communities,

00:01:14.504 --> 00:01:16.928
our way of life. We should be preparing

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:20.585
at every scale and at every opportunity.

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.440
This talk is about being
prepared for, and resilient to

00:01:24.464 --> 00:01:27.226
the changes that are coming
and that will affect our homes

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.780
and our collective home, the Earth.

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:34.132
The changes in these times
won't affect us all equally.

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:36.442
There are important
distributional consequences,

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.610
and they're not what you
always might think.

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:41.852
In New Orleans, the elderly
and female-headed households

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:44.132
were among the most vulnerable.

00:01:44.156 --> 00:01:46.220
For those in vulnerable,
low-lying nations,

00:01:46.244 --> 00:01:49.068
how do you put a dollar value
on losing your country

00:01:49.092 --> 00:01:53.588
where you ancestors are buried?
And where will your people go?

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:55.719
And how will they cope in a foreign land?

00:01:55.743 --> 00:01:57.796
Will there be tensions over immigration,

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.292
or conflicts over competition
for limited resources?

00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:06.284
It's already fueled conflicts
in Chad and Darfur.

00:02:06.308 --> 00:02:11.101
Like it or not, ready
or not, this is our future.

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:14.628
Sure, some are looking
for opportunities in this new world.

00:02:14.652 --> 00:02:17.652
That's the Russians planting
a flag on the ocean bottom

00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:21.084
to stake a claim for minerals
under the receding Arctic sea ice.

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:24.346
But while there might be
some short-term individual winners,

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.884
our collective losses
will far outweigh them.

00:02:27.908 --> 00:02:30.147
Look no further than the insurance
industry as they struggle

00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:32.203
to cope with mounting catastrophic losses

00:02:32.227 --> 00:02:34.629
from extreme weather events.

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:37.484
The military gets it.
They call climate change

00:02:37.508 --> 00:02:40.725
a threat multiplier that could
harm stability and security,

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.614
while governments
around the world are evaluating

00:02:43.638 --> 00:02:45.661
how to respond.

00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:49.836
So what can we do? How can
we prepare and adapt?

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.867
I'd like to share three sets
of examples, starting with

00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:55.836
adapting to violent storms and floods.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.524
In New Orleans, the I-10 Twin Spans,

00:02:58.548 --> 00:03:01.397
with sections knocked
out in Katrina, have been rebuilt

00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:05.372
21 feet higher to allow
for greater storm surge.

00:03:05.396 --> 00:03:07.918
And these raised
and energy-efficient homes

00:03:07.942 --> 00:03:10.780
were developed by Brad
Pitt and Make It Right

00:03:10.804 --> 00:03:13.596
for the hard-hit Ninth Ward.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.692
The devastated church
my mom attends has been

00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:19.364
not only rebuilt higher,
it's poised to become

00:03:19.388 --> 00:03:21.996
the first Energy Star
church in the country.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.116
They're selling electricity
back to the grid

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.763
thanks to solar panels,
reflective paint and more.

00:03:27.787 --> 00:03:30.340
Their March electricity
bill was only 48 dollars.

00:03:30.364 --> 00:03:34.653
Now these are examples of New
Orleans rebuilding in this way,

00:03:34.677 --> 00:03:39.549
but better if others act proactively
with these changes in mind.

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:43.332
For example, in Galveston,
here's a resilient home

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.780
that survived Hurricane Ike,

00:03:45.804 --> 00:03:48.396
when others on neighboring
lots clearly did not.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.573
And around the world,
satellites and warning systems

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:55.981
are saving lives in flood-prone
areas such as Bangladesh.

00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:59.093
But as important as technology
and infrastructure are,

00:03:59.117 --> 00:04:02.829
perhaps the human element
is even more critical.

00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:06.212
We need better planning
and systems for evacuation.

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:09.301
We need to better understand
how people make decisions

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:11.397
in times of crisis, and why.

00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:15.509
While it's true that many who died in Katrina
did not have access to transportation,

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:18.709
others who did refused to leave
as the storm approached,

00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:22.531
often because available
transportation and shelters

00:04:22.555 --> 00:04:25.045
refused to allow them to take their pets.

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:30.065
Imagine leaving behind your own pet
in an evacuation or a rescue.

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:32.940
Fortunately in 2006, Congress passed

00:04:32.964 --> 00:04:36.414
the Pet Evacuation and Transportation
Standards Act (Laughter)

00:04:36.438 --> 00:04:40.952
— it spells "PETS" — to change that.

00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:43.837
Second, preparing for heat and drought.

00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:46.710
Farmers are facing challenges
of drought from Asia

00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:49.214
to Africa, from Australia to Oklahoma,

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:51.581
while heat waves linked
with climate change

00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:53.982
have killed tens of thousands of people

00:04:54.006 --> 00:05:00.214
in Western Europe in 2003,
and again in Russia in 2010.

00:05:00.238 --> 00:05:05.165
In Ethiopia, 70 percent, that's 7-0
percent of the population,

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:07.774
depends on rainfall for its livelihood.

00:05:07.798 --> 00:05:11.486
Oxfam and Swiss Re, together
with Rockefeller Foundation,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.142
are helping farmers like this
one build hillside terraces

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:17.773
and find other ways to conserve water,

00:05:17.797 --> 00:05:21.774
but they're also providing for insurance
when the droughts do come.

00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:24.132
The stability this provides
is giving the farmers

00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:25.958
the confidence to invest.

00:05:25.982 --> 00:05:28.600
It's giving them access
to affordable credit.

00:05:28.624 --> 00:05:30.248
It's allowing them to become
more productive so that

00:05:30.272 --> 00:05:34.158
they can afford their own insurance
over time, without assistance.

00:05:34.182 --> 00:05:36.802
It's a virtuous cycle,
and one that could be replicated

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:39.153
throughout the developing world.

00:05:39.177 --> 00:05:41.998
After a lethal 1995 heat wave

00:05:42.022 --> 00:05:44.598
turned refrigerator
trucks from the popular

00:05:44.622 --> 00:05:47.791
Taste of Chicago festival
into makeshift morgues,

00:05:47.815 --> 00:05:50.038
Chicago became a recognized leader,

00:05:50.062 --> 00:05:52.869
tamping down on the urban
heat island impact

00:05:52.893 --> 00:05:54.886
through opening cooling centers,

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.095
outreach to vulnerable
neighborhoods, planting trees,

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:01.022
creating cool white
or vegetated green roofs.

00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:04.666
This is City Hall's green roof, next to Cook
County's [portion of the] roof,

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.182
which is 77 degrees Fahrenheit
hotter at the surface.

00:06:08.206 --> 00:06:12.278
Washington, D.C., last year,
actually led the nation

00:06:12.302 --> 00:06:15.590
in new green roofs installed,
and they're funding this in part

00:06:15.614 --> 00:06:19.044
thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags.

00:06:19.068 --> 00:06:21.830
They're splitting the cost
of installing these green roofs

00:06:21.854 --> 00:06:23.542
with home and building owners.

00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:26.073
The roofs not only temper
urban heat island impact

00:06:26.097 --> 00:06:28.430
but they save energy, and therefore money,

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:30.583
the emissions that cause climate change,

00:06:30.607 --> 00:06:33.078
and they also reduce stormwater runoff.

00:06:33.102 --> 00:06:37.830
So some solutions to heat can
provide for win-win-wins.

00:06:37.854 --> 00:06:41.592
Third, adapting to rising seas.

00:06:41.616 --> 00:06:45.238
Sea level rise threatens coastal
ecosystems, agriculture,

00:06:45.262 --> 00:06:48.622
even major cities. This
is what one to two meters

00:06:48.646 --> 00:06:51.622
of sea level rise looks
like in the Mekong Delta.

00:06:51.646 --> 00:06:54.273
That's where half
of Vietnam's rice is grown.

00:06:54.297 --> 00:06:57.406
Infrastructure is going to be affected.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.926
Airports around the world
are located on the coast.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.950
It makes sense, right? There's open space,

00:07:01.974 --> 00:07:04.595
the planes can take off and land
without worrying about

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:06.810
creating noise or avoiding tall buildings.

00:07:06.834 --> 00:07:09.946
Here's just one example,
San Francisco Airport,

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.660
with 16 inches or more of flooding.

00:07:12.684 --> 00:07:15.562
Imagine the staggering cost of protecting

00:07:15.586 --> 00:07:18.916
this vital infrastructure with levees.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.845
But there might be some changes in store

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:23.052
that you might not imagine. For example,

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:25.613
planes require more runway for takeoff

00:07:25.637 --> 00:07:29.479
because the heated, less dense
air, provides for less lift.

00:07:29.503 --> 00:07:32.964
San Francisco is also
spending 40 million dollars

00:07:32.988 --> 00:07:36.154
to rethink and redesign its
water and sewage treatment,

00:07:36.178 --> 00:07:39.484
as water outfall pipes like this
one can be flooded with seawater,

00:07:39.508 --> 00:07:42.453
causing backups at the plant,
harming the bacteria

00:07:42.477 --> 00:07:44.144
that are needed to treat the waste.

00:07:44.168 --> 00:07:46.264
So these outfall pipes
have been retrofitted

00:07:46.288 --> 00:07:49.420
to shut seawater
off from entering the system.

00:07:49.444 --> 00:07:52.348
Beyond these technical solutions, our work

00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:54.116
at the Georgetown Climate
Center with communities

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.884
encourages them to look at what existing
legal and policy tools are available

00:07:57.908 --> 00:08:01.460
and to consider how they can
accommodate change.

00:08:01.484 --> 00:08:04.412
For example, in land use,
which areas do you want

00:08:04.436 --> 00:08:07.372
to protect, through adding
a seawall, for example,

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:11.148
alter, by raising
buildings, or retreat from,

00:08:11.172 --> 00:08:13.956
to allow the migration
of important natural systems,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.683
such as wetlands or beaches?

00:08:16.707 --> 00:08:18.940
Other examples to consider. In the U.K.,

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:22.394
the Thames Barrier protects
London from storm surge.

00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:24.940
The Asian Cities Climate
[Change] Resilience Network

00:08:24.964 --> 00:08:28.138
is restoring vital ecosystems
like forest mangroves.

00:08:28.162 --> 00:08:31.228
These are not only important
ecosystems in their own right,

00:08:31.252 --> 00:08:35.524
but they also serve as a buffer
to protect inland communities.

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:39.236
New York City is incredibly
vulnerable to storms,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.919
as you can see from this clever
sign, and to sea level rise,

00:08:42.943 --> 00:08:46.079
and to storm surge, as you can
see from the subway flooding.

00:08:46.103 --> 00:08:49.489
But back above ground, these
raised ventilation grates

00:08:49.513 --> 00:08:52.037
for the subway system show
that solutions can be both

00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:54.703
functional and attractive.
In fact, in New York,

00:08:54.727 --> 00:08:57.855
San Francisco and London,
designers have envisioned

00:08:57.879 --> 00:09:00.743
ways to better integrate
the natural and built environments

00:09:00.767 --> 00:09:03.151
with climate change in mind.

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:06.055
I think these are inspiring
examples of what's possible

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:09.222
when we feel empowered to plan
for a world that will be different.

00:09:09.246 --> 00:09:12.240
But now, a word of caution.

00:09:12.264 --> 00:09:15.119
Adaptation's too important
to be left to the experts.

00:09:15.143 --> 00:09:18.471
Why? Well, there are no experts.

00:09:18.495 --> 00:09:21.791
We're entering uncharted
territory, and yet

00:09:21.815 --> 00:09:25.687
our expertise and our systems
are based on the past.

00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:28.664
"Stationarity" is the notion
that we can anticipate the future

00:09:28.688 --> 00:09:31.535
based on the past, and plan accordingly,

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:33.988
and this principle governs
much of our engineering,

00:09:34.012 --> 00:09:37.037
our design of critical
infrastructure, city water systems,

00:09:37.061 --> 00:09:41.158
building codes, even water rights
and other legal precedents.

00:09:41.182 --> 00:09:44.287
But we can simply no longer
rely on established norms.

00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:48.647
We're operating outside the bounds
of CO2 concentrations

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:53.154
that the planet has seen
for hundreds of thousands of years.

00:09:53.178 --> 00:09:56.467
The larger point I'm
trying to make is this.

00:09:56.491 --> 00:10:00.163
It's up to us to look
at our homes and our communities,

00:10:00.187 --> 00:10:02.850
our vulnerabilities
and our exposures to risk,

00:10:02.874 --> 00:10:06.395
and to find ways to not just
survive, but to thrive,

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:09.139
and it's up to us to plan and to prepare

00:10:09.163 --> 00:10:11.735
and to call on our government
leaders and require them

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:13.795
to do the same, even while they address

00:10:13.819 --> 00:10:17.034
the underlying causes of climate change.

00:10:17.058 --> 00:10:18.690
There are no quick fixes.

00:10:18.714 --> 00:10:21.965
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions.

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:23.874
We're all learning by doing.

00:10:23.898 --> 00:10:27.979
But the operative word is doing.

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.282
Thank you.

00:10:29.306 --> 00:10:33.306
(Applause)
