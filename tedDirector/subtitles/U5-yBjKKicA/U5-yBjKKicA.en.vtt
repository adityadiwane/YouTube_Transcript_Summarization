00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.156
A few days after my husband Paul
was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.676
we were lying in our bed at home,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.476
and Paul said,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.700
"It's going to be OK."

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.356
And I remember answering back,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.596
"Yes.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.380
We just don't know what OK means yet."

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.636
Paul and I had met as first-year
medical students at Yale.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.100
He was smart and kind and super funny.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.516
He used to keep a gorilla suit
in the trunk of his car,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.956
and he'd say, "It's for emergencies only."

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.180
(Laughter)

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.740
I fell in love with Paul as I watched
the care he took with his patients.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.396
He stayed late talking with them,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.876
seeking to understand
the experience of illness

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.020
and not just its technicalities.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.596
He later told me he fell in love with me

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.660
when he saw me cry over an EKG
of a heart that had ceased beating.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.476
We didn't know it yet,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.636
but even in the heady days of young love,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.780
we were learning how
to approach suffering together.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.036
We got married and became doctors.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.076
I was working as an internist

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.156
and Paul was finishing his training
as a neurosurgeon

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.820
when he started to lose weight.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.220
He developed excruciating back pain
and a cough that wouldn't go away.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.356
And when he was admitted to the hospital,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.460
a CT scan revealed tumors
in Paul's lungs and in his bones.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.060
We had both cared for patients
with devastating diagnoses;

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.380
now it was our turn.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.140
We lived with Paul's illness
for 22 months.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.260
He wrote a memoir about facing mortality.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.300
I gave birth to our daughter Cady,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.740
and we loved her and each other.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.180
We learned directly how to struggle
through really tough medical decisions.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.715
The day we took Paul
into the hospital for the last time

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.780
was the most difficult day of my life.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.356
When he turned to me at the end

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.860
and said, "I'm ready,"

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.500
I knew that wasn't just a brave decision.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.420
It was the right one.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.380
Paul didn't want a ventilator and CPR.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.676
In that moment,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.300
the most important thing to Paul

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.060
was to hold our baby daughter.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.876
Nine hours later,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.100
Paul died.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.036
I've always thought of myself
as a caregiver --

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.116
most physicians do --

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.940
and taking care of Paul
deepened what that meant.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.556
Watching him reshape
his identity during his illness,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.076
learning to witness and accept his pain,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.636
talking together through his choices --

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.076
those experiences taught me

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.356
that resilience does not mean
bouncing back to where you were before,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.060
or pretending that
the hard stuff isn't hard.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.940
It is so hard.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.260
It's painful, messy stuff.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.556
But it's the stuff.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.820
And I learned that when we
approach it together,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.620
we get to decide what success looks like.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.220
One of the first things
Paul said to me after his diagnosis was,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.700
"I want you to get remarried."

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.636
And I was like, whoa, I guess
we get to say anything out loud.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.196
(Laughter)

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.276
It was so shocking

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.100
and heartbreaking ...

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.476
and generous,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.996
and really comforting

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.596
because it was so starkly honest,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.740
and that honesty turned out
to be exactly what we needed.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.276
Early in Paul's illness,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.660
we agreed we would
just keep saying things out loud.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.516
Tasks like making a will,

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.196
or completing our advance directives --

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.796
tasks that I had always avoided --

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.100
were not as daunting as they once seemed.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.219
I realized that completing
an advance directive is an act of love --

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.860
like a wedding vow.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.796
A pact to take care of someone,

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.116
codifying the promise

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.060
that til death do us part,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.300
I will be there.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.220
If needed, I will speak for you.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.300
I will honor your wishes.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.460
That paperwork became
a tangible part of our love story.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.076
As physicians,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.756
Paul and I were in a good position

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.940
to understand and even
accept his diagnosis.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.276
We weren't angry about it,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.516
luckily,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.676
because we'd seen so many patients
in devastating situations,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.380
and we knew that death is a part of life.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.276
But it's one thing to know that;

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.956
it was a very different experience

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.460
to actually live with the sadness
and uncertainty of a serious illness.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.756
Huge strides are being made
against lung cancer,

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.540
but we knew that Paul likely had
months to a few years left to live.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.756
During that time,

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.580
Paul wrote about his transition
from doctor to patient.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.556
He talked about feeling
like he was suddenly at a crossroads,

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.380
and how he would have thought
he'd be able to see the path,

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.876
that because he treated so many patients,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.180
maybe he could follow in their footsteps.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.900
But he was totally disoriented.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.036
Rather than a path,

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.556
Paul wrote,

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.636
"I saw instead

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.820
only a harsh, vacant,
gleaming white desert.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.700
As if a sandstorm
had erased all familiarity.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.820
I had to face my mortality

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.420
and try to understand
what made my life worth living,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.980
and I needed my oncologist's
help to do so."

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.316
The clinicians taking care of Paul

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.556
gave me an even deeper appreciation
for my colleagues in health care.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.556
We have a tough job.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.356
We're responsible for helping patients
have clarity around their prognoses

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.356
and their treatment options,

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.876
and that's never easy,
but it's especially tough

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.580
when you're dealing with potentially
terminal illnesses like cancer.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.836
Some people don't want to know
how long they have left,

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.060
others do.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.140
Either way, we never have those answers.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.860
Sometimes we substitute hope

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.260
by emphasizing the best-case scenario.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.236
In a survey of physicians,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.076
55 percent said
they painted a rosier picture

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.556
than their honest opinion

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.540
when describing a patient's prognosis.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.500
It's an instinct born out of kindness.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.356
But researchers have found

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.596
that when people better understand
the possible outcomes of an illness,

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.140
they have less anxiety,

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.660
greater ability to plan

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.980
and less trauma for their families.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.356
Families can struggle
with those conversations,

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:49.860
but for us, we also found that information
immensely helpful with big decisions.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.940
Most notably,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.060
whether to have a baby.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.580
Months to a few years meant
Paul was not likely to see her grow up.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.156
But he had a good chance
of being there for her birth

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.820
and for the beginning of her life.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.436
I remember asking Paul

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.836
if he thought having
to say goodbye to a child

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.380
would make dying even more painful.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.076
And his answer astounded me.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.796
He said,

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.060
"Wouldn't it be great if it did?"

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.060
And we did it.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.220
Not in order to spite cancer,

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.196
but because we were learning

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:40.380
that living fully
means accepting suffering.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.116
Paul's oncologist tailored his chemo

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.436
so he could continue
working as a neurosurgeon,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.900
which initially we thought
was totally impossible.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.636
When the cancer advanced

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.180
and Paul shifted from surgery to writing,

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.356
his palliative care doctor
prescribed a stimulant medication

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.980
so he could be more focused.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.100
They asked Paul about
his priorities and his worries.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.540
They asked him what trade-offs
he was willing to make.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.436
Those conversations
are the best way to ensure

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.340
that your health care matches your values.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.756
Paul joked that it's not
like that "birds and bees" talk

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.116
you have with your parents,

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.676
where you all get it over with
as quickly as possible,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.396
and then pretend it never happened.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.316
You revisit the conversation
as things change.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.260
You keep saying things out loud.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.476
I'm forever grateful

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.876
because Paul's clinicians felt

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.996
that their job wasn't to try
to give us answers they didn't have,

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.396
or only to try to fix things for us,

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.220
but to counsel Paul
through painful choices ...

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:59.140
when his body was failing
but his will to live wasn't.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.820
Later, after Paul died,

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.476
I received a dozen bouquets of flowers,

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.020
but I sent just one ...

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.956
to Paul's oncologist,

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.436
because she supported his goals

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.020
and she helped him weigh his choices.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:23.020
She knew that living
means more than just staying alive.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.436
A few weeks ago,
a patient came into my clinic.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.620
A woman dealing
with a serious chronic disease.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.596
And while we were talking
about her life and her health care,

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.100
she said, "I love my palliative care team.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.020
They taught me that it's OK to say 'no'."

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.260
Yeah, I thought, of course it is.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.900
But many patients don't feel that.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.796
Compassion and Choices did a study

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.020
where they asked people
about their health care preferences.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.636
And a lot of people
started their answers with the words

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.100
"Well, if I had a choice ..."

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.420
If I had a choice.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.596
And when I read that "if,"

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.796
I understood better

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.676
why one in four people

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.556
receives excessive or unwanted
medical treatment,

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:23.740
or watches a family member receive
excessive or unwanted medical treatment.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.516
It's not because doctors don't get it.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.740
We do.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.276
We understand the real
psychological consequences

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.660
on patients and their families.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.420
The things is, we deal with them, too.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.876
Half of critical care nurses
and a quarter of ICU doctors

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.436
have considered quitting their jobs

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.356
because of distress over feeling
that for some of their patients,

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.780
they've provided care
that didn't fit with the person's values.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.716
But doctors can't make sure
your wishes are respected

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.940
until they know what they are.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.540
Would you want to be on life support
if it offered any chance of longer life?

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.436
Are you most worried
about the quality of that time,

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.660
rather than quantity?

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.820
Both of those choices
are thoughtful and brave,

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.860
but for all of us, it's our choice.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.740
That's true at the end of life

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.316
and for medical care throughout our lives.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.196
If you're pregnant,
do you want genetic screening?

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.140
Is a knee replacement right or not?

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.740
Do you want to do dialysis
in a clinic or at home?

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.620
The answer is:

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.660
it depends.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.860
What medical care will help you
live the way you want to?

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.116
I hope you remember that question

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.300
the next time you face
a decision in your health care.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.060
Remember that you always have a choice,

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:04.780
and it is OK to say no to a treatment
that's not right for you.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.796
There's a poem by W.S. Merwin --

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.116
it's just two sentences long --

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.260
that captures how I feel now.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.916
"Your absence has gone through me

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.460
like thread through a needle.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.100
Everything I do
is stitched with its color."

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.580
For me that poem evokes my love for Paul,

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.316
and a new fortitude

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.380
that came from loving and losing him.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.580
When Paul said, "It's going to be OK,"

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.500
that didn't mean
that we could cure his illness.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.940
Instead, we learned to accept
both joy and sadness at the same time;

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.356
to uncover beauty and purpose

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.540
both despite and because we are all born

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.540
and we all die.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.900
And for all the sadness
and sleepless nights,

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.140
it turns out there is joy.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.876
I leave flowers on Paul's grave

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.620
and watch our two-year-old
run around on the grass.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.660
I build bonfires on the beach
and watch the sunset with our friends.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.100
Exercise and mindfulness
meditation have helped a lot.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.916
And someday,

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.500
I hope I do get remarried.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.140
Most importantly,
I get to watch our daughter grow.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.436
I've thought a lot
about what I'm going to say to her

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.700
when she's older.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.420
"Cady,

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.796
engaging in the full
range of experience --

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.516
living and dying,

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.020
love and loss --

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.140
is what we get to do.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:05.940
Being human doesn't happen
despite suffering.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.780
It happens within it.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.500
When we approach suffering together,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.500
when we choose not to hide from it,

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.316
our lives don't diminish,

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.540
they expand."

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.420
I've learned that cancer
isn't always a battle.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.876
Or if it is,

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.900
maybe it's a fight for something
different than we thought.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.820
Our job isn't to fight fate,

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.700
but to help each other through.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.620
Not as soldiers

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.020
but as shepherds.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.796
That's how we make it OK,

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.300
even when it's not.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.260
By saying it out loud,

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.180
by helping each other through ...

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.060
and a gorilla suit never hurts, either.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.316
Thank you.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:08.436
(Applause)
