00:00:12.588 --> 00:00:15.619
I'm a computer science professor,

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.932
and my area of expertise is

00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:20.131
computer and information security.

00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:22.451
When I was in graduate school,

00:00:22.451 --> 00:00:25.052
I had the opportunity to overhear my grandmother

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:29.186
describing to one of her fellow senior citizens

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:31.555
what I did for a living.

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:35.117
Apparently, I was in charge of making sure that

00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:39.017
no one stole the computers from the university. (Laughter)

00:00:39.017 --> 00:00:41.761
And, you know, that's a perfectly reasonable thing

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:43.681
for her to think, because I told her I was working

00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:45.188
in computer security,

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:48.785
and it was interesting to get her perspective.

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:51.402
But that's not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:53.419
anyone say about my work.

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.703
The most ridiculous thing I ever heard is,

00:00:55.703 --> 00:00:58.837
I was at a dinner party, and a woman heard

00:00:58.837 --> 00:01:00.620
that I work in computer security,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.137
and she asked me if -- she said her computer had been

00:01:04.137 --> 00:01:07.573
infected by a virus, and she was very concerned that she

00:01:07.573 --> 00:01:11.524
might get sick from it, that she could get this virus. (Laughter)

00:01:11.524 --> 00:01:14.467
And I'm not a doctor, but I reassured her

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:17.611
that it was very, very unlikely that this would happen,

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:20.412
but if she felt more comfortable, she could be free to use

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:22.260
latex gloves when she was on the computer,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.652
and there would be no harm whatsoever in that.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:28.159
I'm going to get back to this notion of being able to get

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.667
a virus from your computer, in a serious way.

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:33.307
What I'm going to talk to you about today

00:01:33.307 --> 00:01:38.153
are some hacks, some real world cyberattacks that people

00:01:38.153 --> 00:01:40.707
in my community, the academic research community,

00:01:40.707 --> 00:01:43.501
have performed, which I don't think

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:44.709
most people know about,

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:47.737
and I think they're very interesting and scary,

00:01:47.737 --> 00:01:50.178
and this talk is kind of a greatest hits

00:01:50.178 --> 00:01:53.169
of the academic security community's hacks.

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:55.156
None of the work is my work. It's all work

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:57.330
that my colleagues have done, and I actually asked them

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.887
for their slides and incorporated them into this talk.

00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:01.629
So the first one I'm going to talk about

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:04.303
are implanted medical devices.

00:02:04.303 --> 00:02:07.343
Now medical devices have come a long way technologically.

00:02:07.343 --> 00:02:11.199
You can see in 1926 the first pacemaker was invented.

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.751
1960, the first internal pacemaker was implanted,

00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:17.303
hopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there,

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.271
and the technology has continued to move forward.

00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:24.904
In 2006, we hit an important milestone from the perspective

00:02:24.904 --> 00:02:28.071
of computer security.

00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:29.412
And why do I say that?

00:02:29.412 --> 00:02:32.302
Because that's when implanted devices inside of people

00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:35.047
started to have networking capabilities.

00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:36.927
One thing that brings us close to home is we look

00:02:36.927 --> 00:02:39.632
at Dick Cheney's device, he had a device that

00:02:39.632 --> 00:02:43.501
pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart,

00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:44.684
and as you can see at the bottom there,

00:02:44.684 --> 00:02:47.693
it was controlled by a computer controller,

00:02:47.693 --> 00:02:50.210
and if you ever thought that software liability

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.799
was very important, get one of these inside of you.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.494
Now what a research team did was they got their hands

00:02:57.494 --> 00:02:58.914
on what's called an ICD.

00:02:58.914 --> 00:03:00.984
This is a defibrillator, and this is a device

00:03:00.984 --> 00:03:05.320
that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.658
and these have saved many lives.

00:03:07.658 --> 00:03:10.130
Well, in order to not have to open up the person

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.324
every time you want to reprogram their device

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:14.779
or do some diagnostics on it, they made the thing be able

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.881
to communicate wirelessly, and what this research team did

00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:20.491
is they reverse engineered the wireless protocol,

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:22.363
and they built the device you see pictured here,

00:03:22.363 --> 00:03:25.123
with a little antenna, that could talk the protocol

00:03:25.123 --> 00:03:29.598
to the device, and thus control it.

00:03:29.598 --> 00:03:32.287
In order to make their experience real -- they were unable

00:03:32.287 --> 00:03:34.759
to find any volunteers, and so they went

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.903
and they got some ground beef and some bacon

00:03:36.903 --> 00:03:38.691
and they wrapped it all up to about the size

00:03:38.691 --> 00:03:41.489
of a human being's area where the device would go,

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.943
and they stuck the device inside it

00:03:42.943 --> 00:03:46.075
to perform their experiment somewhat realistically.

00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:49.095
They launched many, many successful attacks.

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:52.151
One that I'll highlight here is changing the patient's name.

00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:53.144
I don't know why you would want to do that,

00:03:53.144 --> 00:03:55.248
but I sure wouldn't want that done to me.

00:03:55.248 --> 00:03:57.579
And they were able to change therapies,

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.074
including disabling the device -- and this is with a real,

00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:01.970
commercial, off-the-shelf device --

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.016
simply by performing reverse engineering and sending

00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:07.005
wireless signals to it.

00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:10.585
There was a piece on NPR that some of these ICDs

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:13.007
could actually have their performance disrupted

00:04:13.007 --> 00:04:16.658
simply by holding a pair of headphones onto them.

00:04:16.658 --> 00:04:18.067
Now, wireless and the Internet

00:04:18.067 --> 00:04:19.719
can improve health care greatly.

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:21.806
There's several examples up on the screen

00:04:21.806 --> 00:04:24.913
of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices

00:04:24.913 --> 00:04:27.778
inside of people, and all of these devices now,

00:04:27.778 --> 00:04:30.903
it's standard that they communicate wirelessly,

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:32.315
and I think this is great,

00:04:32.315 --> 00:04:35.420
but without a full understanding of trustworthy computing,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.827
and without understanding what attackers can do

00:04:37.827 --> 00:04:39.974
and the security risks from the beginning,

00:04:39.974 --> 00:04:42.364
there's a lot of danger in this.

00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:43.841
Okay, let me shift gears and show you another target.

00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:45.929
I'm going to show you a few different targets like this,

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:48.846
and that's my talk. So we'll look at automobiles.

00:04:48.846 --> 00:04:51.742
This is a car, and it has a lot of components,

00:04:51.742 --> 00:04:53.362
a lot of electronics in it today.

00:04:53.362 --> 00:04:57.739
In fact, it's got many, many different computers inside of it,

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:00.894
more Pentiums than my lab did when I was in college,

00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:04.533
and they're connected by a wired network.

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:07.964
There's also a wireless network in the car,

00:05:07.964 --> 00:05:11.197
which can be reached from many different ways.

00:05:11.197 --> 00:05:14.898
So there's Bluetooth, there's the FM and XM radio,

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.718
there's actually wi-fi, there's sensors in the wheels

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:19.871
that wirelessly communicate the tire pressure

00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:21.677
to a controller on board.

00:05:21.677 --> 00:05:26.595
The modern car is a sophisticated multi-computer device.

00:05:26.595 --> 00:05:29.917
And what happens if somebody wanted to attack this?

00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:31.234
Well, that's what the researchers

00:05:31.234 --> 00:05:33.105
that I'm going to talk about today did.

00:05:33.105 --> 00:05:36.082
They basically stuck an attacker on the wired network

00:05:36.082 --> 00:05:38.404
and on the wireless network.

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:41.103
Now, they have two areas they can attack.

00:05:41.103 --> 00:05:43.141
One is short-range wireless, where you can actually

00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:44.922
communicate with the device from nearby,

00:05:44.922 --> 00:05:47.059
either through Bluetooth or wi-fi,

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:49.233
and the other is long-range, where you can communicate

00:05:49.233 --> 00:05:51.015
with the car through the cellular network,

00:05:51.015 --> 00:05:52.975
or through one of the radio stations.

00:05:52.975 --> 00:05:56.024
Think about it. When a car receives a radio signal,

00:05:56.024 --> 00:05:58.225
it's processed by software.

00:05:58.225 --> 00:06:01.286
That software has to receive and decode the radio signal,

00:06:01.286 --> 00:06:02.405
and then figure out what to do with it,

00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:05.429
even if it's just music that it needs to play on the radio,

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:07.697
and that software that does that decoding,

00:06:07.697 --> 00:06:10.790
if it has any bugs in it, could create a vulnerability

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.825
for somebody to hack the car.

00:06:13.825 --> 00:06:16.777
The way that the researchers did this work is,

00:06:16.777 --> 00:06:21.000
they read the software in the computer chips

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.193
that were in the car, and then they used sophisticated

00:06:24.193 --> 00:06:25.607
reverse engineering tools

00:06:25.607 --> 00:06:27.662
to figure out what that software did,

00:06:27.662 --> 00:06:30.703
and then they found vulnerabilities in that software,

00:06:30.703 --> 00:06:34.049
and then they built exploits to exploit those.

00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:36.431
They actually carried out their attack in real life.

00:06:36.431 --> 00:06:37.781
They bought two cars, and I guess

00:06:37.781 --> 00:06:40.699
they have better budgets than I do.

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.289
The first threat model was to see what someone could do

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.433
if an attacker actually got access

00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:47.486
to the internal network on the car.

00:06:47.486 --> 00:06:50.089
Okay, so think of that as, someone gets to go to your car,

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:52.993
they get to mess around with it, and then they leave,

00:06:52.993 --> 00:06:55.361
and now, what kind of trouble are you in?

00:06:55.361 --> 00:06:58.153
The other threat model is that they contact you

00:06:58.153 --> 00:07:00.610
in real time over one of the wireless networks

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.665
like the cellular, or something like that,

00:07:02.665 --> 00:07:06.665
never having actually gotten physical access to your car.

00:07:06.665 --> 00:07:09.489
This is what their setup looks like for the first model,

00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:11.172
where you get to have access to the car.

00:07:11.172 --> 00:07:14.559
They put a laptop, and they connected to the diagnostic unit

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.498
on the in-car network, and they did all kinds of silly things,

00:07:17.498 --> 00:07:20.281
like here's a picture of the speedometer

00:07:20.281 --> 00:07:23.097
showing 140 miles an hour when the car's in park.

00:07:23.097 --> 00:07:25.470
Once you have control of the car's computers,

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.389
you can do anything.

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:28.005
Now you might say, "Okay, that's silly."

00:07:28.005 --> 00:07:29.664
Well, what if you make the car always say

00:07:29.664 --> 00:07:32.405
it's going 20 miles an hour slower than it's actually going?

00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:34.947
You might produce a lot of speeding tickets.

00:07:34.947 --> 00:07:38.803
Then they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars,

00:07:38.803 --> 00:07:41.548
the target victim car and the chase car,

00:07:41.548 --> 00:07:44.294
and they launched a bunch of other attacks.

00:07:44.294 --> 00:07:47.060
One of the things they were able to do from the chase car

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.034
is apply the brakes on the other car,

00:07:49.034 --> 00:07:50.594
simply by hacking the computer.

00:07:50.594 --> 00:07:53.025
They were able to disable the brakes.

00:07:53.025 --> 00:07:56.203
They also were able to install malware that wouldn't kick in

00:07:56.203 --> 00:07:58.628
and wouldn't trigger until the car was doing something like

00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:02.374
going over 20 miles an hour, or something like that.

00:08:02.374 --> 00:08:05.132
The results are astonishing, and when they gave this talk,

00:08:05.132 --> 00:08:06.848
even though they gave this talk at a conference

00:08:06.848 --> 00:08:08.574
to a bunch of computer security researchers,

00:08:08.574 --> 00:08:10.274
everybody was gasping.

00:08:10.274 --> 00:08:13.973
They were able to take over a bunch of critical computers

00:08:13.973 --> 00:08:17.734
inside the car: the brakes computer, the lighting computer,

00:08:17.734 --> 00:08:20.561
the engine, the dash, the radio, etc.,

00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:22.854
and they were able to perform these on real commercial

00:08:22.854 --> 00:08:25.881
cars that they purchased using the radio network.

00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:28.884
They were able to compromise every single one of the

00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:31.350
pieces of software that controlled every single one

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.365
of the wireless capabilities of the car.

00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:36.878
All of these were implemented successfully.

00:08:36.878 --> 00:08:39.230
How would you steal a car in this model?

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.910
Well, you compromise the car by a buffer overflow

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.437
of vulnerability in the software, something like that.

00:08:45.437 --> 00:08:47.640
You use the GPS in the car to locate it.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.835
You remotely unlock the doors through the computer

00:08:49.835 --> 00:08:52.973
that controls that, start the engine, bypass anti-theft,

00:08:52.973 --> 00:08:54.641
and you've got yourself a car.

00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:57.128
Surveillance was really interesting.

00:08:57.128 --> 00:09:00.337
The authors of the study have a video where they show

00:09:00.337 --> 00:09:02.886
themselves taking over a car and then turning on

00:09:02.886 --> 00:09:05.647
the microphone in the car, and listening in on the car

00:09:05.647 --> 00:09:08.998
while tracking it via GPS on a map,

00:09:08.998 --> 00:09:10.711
and so that's something that the drivers of the car

00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:12.879
would never know was happening.

00:09:12.879 --> 00:09:15.013
Am I scaring you yet?

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.956
I've got a few more of these interesting ones.

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:18.789
These are ones where I went to a conference,

00:09:18.789 --> 00:09:20.722
and my mind was just blown, and I said,

00:09:20.722 --> 00:09:22.548
"I have to share this with other people."

00:09:22.548 --> 00:09:24.171
This was Fabian Monrose's lab

00:09:24.171 --> 00:09:27.627
at the University of North Carolina, and what they did was

00:09:27.627 --> 00:09:29.702
something intuitive once you see it,

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:31.416
but kind of surprising.

00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:33.675
They videotaped people on a bus,

00:09:33.675 --> 00:09:36.515
and then they post-processed the video.

00:09:36.515 --> 00:09:38.978
What you see here in number one is a

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:43.361
reflection in somebody's glasses of the smartphone

00:09:43.361 --> 00:09:44.786
that they're typing in.

00:09:44.786 --> 00:09:46.761
They wrote software to stabilize --

00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:48.126
even though they were on a bus

00:09:48.126 --> 00:09:51.337
and maybe someone's holding their phone at an angle --

00:09:51.337 --> 00:09:53.707
to stabilize the phone, process it, and

00:09:53.707 --> 00:09:55.592
you may know on your smartphone, when you type

00:09:55.592 --> 00:09:58.531
a password, the keys pop out a little bit, and they were able

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:01.371
to use that to reconstruct what the person was typing,

00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:05.692
and had a language model for detecting typing.

00:10:05.692 --> 00:10:08.027
What was interesting is, by videotaping on a bus,

00:10:08.027 --> 00:10:10.156
they were able to produce exactly what people

00:10:10.156 --> 00:10:12.307
on their smartphones were typing,

00:10:12.307 --> 00:10:14.567
and then they had a surprising result, which is that

00:10:14.567 --> 00:10:17.331
their software had not only done it for their target,

00:10:17.331 --> 00:10:18.734
but other people who accidentally happened

00:10:18.734 --> 00:10:20.820
to be in the picture, they were able to produce

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.547
what those people had been typing, and that was kind of

00:10:23.547 --> 00:10:27.164
an accidental artifact of what their software was doing.

00:10:27.164 --> 00:10:31.467
I'll show you two more. One is P25 radios.

00:10:31.467 --> 00:10:34.267
P25 radios are used by law enforcement

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:37.674
and all kinds of government agencies

00:10:37.674 --> 00:10:39.410
and people in combat to communicate,

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.243
and there's an encryption option on these phones.

00:10:42.243 --> 00:10:44.971
This is what the phone looks like. It's not really a phone.

00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:46.177
It's more of a two-way radio.

00:10:46.177 --> 00:10:49.499
Motorola makes the most widely used one, and you can see

00:10:49.499 --> 00:10:52.148
that they're used by Secret Service, they're used in combat,

00:10:52.148 --> 00:10:55.250
it's a very, very common standard in the U.S. and elsewhere.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.555
So one question the researchers asked themselves is,

00:10:57.555 --> 00:11:00.259
could you block this thing, right?

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:01.842
Could you run a denial-of-service,

00:11:01.842 --> 00:11:03.666
because these are first responders?

00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:05.467
So, would a terrorist organization want to black out the

00:11:05.467 --> 00:11:09.955
ability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency?

00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:13.027
They found that there's this GirlTech device used for texting

00:11:13.027 --> 00:11:15.745
that happens to operate at the same exact frequency

00:11:15.745 --> 00:11:18.016
as the P25, and they built what they called

00:11:18.016 --> 00:11:22.350
My First Jammer. (Laughter)

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.728
If you look closely at this device,

00:11:24.728 --> 00:11:28.358
it's got a switch for encryption or cleartext.

00:11:28.358 --> 00:11:31.408
Let me advance the slide, and now I'll go back.

00:11:31.408 --> 00:11:33.955
You see the difference?

00:11:33.955 --> 00:11:36.512
This is plain text. This is encrypted.

00:11:36.512 --> 00:11:39.069
There's one little dot that shows up on the screen,

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:41.154
and one little tiny turn of the switch.

00:11:41.154 --> 00:11:43.058
And so the researchers asked themselves, "I wonder how

00:11:43.058 --> 00:11:47.315
many times very secure, important, sensitive conversations

00:11:47.315 --> 00:11:48.938
are happening on these two-way radios where they forget

00:11:48.938 --> 00:11:51.848
to encrypt and they don't notice that they didn't encrypt?"

00:11:51.848 --> 00:11:55.187
So they bought a scanner. These are perfectly legal

00:11:55.187 --> 00:11:58.645
and they run at the frequency of the P25,

00:11:58.645 --> 00:12:00.412
and what they did is they hopped around frequencies

00:12:00.412 --> 00:12:02.922
and they wrote software to listen in.

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:05.556
If they found encrypted communication, they stayed

00:12:05.556 --> 00:12:07.242
on that channel and they wrote down, that's a channel

00:12:07.242 --> 00:12:09.030
that these people communicate in,

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.652
these law enforcement agencies,

00:12:10.652 --> 00:12:14.043
and they went to 20 metropolitan areas and listened in

00:12:14.043 --> 00:12:17.518
on conversations that were happening at those frequencies.

00:12:17.518 --> 00:12:20.757
They found that in every metropolitan area,

00:12:20.757 --> 00:12:22.911
they would capture over 20 minutes a day

00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:25.286
of cleartext communication.

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:27.286
And what kind of things were people talking about?

00:12:27.286 --> 00:12:28.770
Well, they found the names and information

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.622
about confidential informants. They found information

00:12:31.622 --> 00:12:33.824
that was being recorded in wiretaps,

00:12:33.824 --> 00:12:36.534
a bunch of crimes that were being discussed,

00:12:36.534 --> 00:12:37.696
sensitive information.

00:12:37.696 --> 00:12:41.059
It was mostly law enforcement and criminal.

00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:42.893
They went and reported this to the law enforcement

00:12:42.893 --> 00:12:44.916
agencies, after anonymizing it,

00:12:44.916 --> 00:12:47.916
and the vulnerability here is simply the user interface

00:12:47.916 --> 00:12:49.310
wasn't good enough. If you're talking

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.126
about something really secure and sensitive, it should

00:12:52.126 --> 00:12:55.419
be really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted.

00:12:55.419 --> 00:12:57.305
That one's pretty easy to fix.

00:12:57.305 --> 00:12:58.974
The last one I thought was really, really cool,

00:12:58.974 --> 00:13:01.787
and I just had to show it to you, it's probably not something

00:13:01.787 --> 00:13:02.792
that you're going to lose sleep over

00:13:02.792 --> 00:13:04.583
like the cars or the defibrillators,

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:07.606
but it's stealing keystrokes.

00:13:07.606 --> 00:13:10.353
Now, we've all looked at smartphones upside down.

00:13:10.353 --> 00:13:12.543
Every security expert wants to hack a smartphone,

00:13:12.543 --> 00:13:17.155
and we tend to look at the USB port, the GPS for tracking,

00:13:17.155 --> 00:13:20.363
the camera, the microphone, but no one up till this point

00:13:20.363 --> 00:13:21.943
had looked at the accelerometer.

00:13:21.943 --> 00:13:23.590
The accelerometer is the thing that determines

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:27.084
the vertical orientation of the smartphone.

00:13:27.084 --> 00:13:28.501
And so they had a simple setup.

00:13:28.501 --> 00:13:31.259
They put a smartphone next to a keyboard,

00:13:31.259 --> 00:13:33.971
and they had people type, and then their goal was

00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:36.827
to use the vibrations that were created by typing

00:13:36.827 --> 00:13:41.067
to measure the change in the accelerometer reading

00:13:41.067 --> 00:13:44.243
to determine what the person had been typing.

00:13:44.243 --> 00:13:46.819
Now, when they tried this on an iPhone 3GS,

00:13:46.819 --> 00:13:49.588
this is a graph of the perturbations that were created

00:13:49.588 --> 00:13:52.829
by the typing, and you can see that it's very difficult

00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:55.907
to tell when somebody was typing or what they were typing,

00:13:55.907 --> 00:13:58.997
but the iPhone 4 greatly improved the accelerometer,

00:13:58.997 --> 00:14:02.477
and so the same measurement

00:14:02.477 --> 00:14:04.309
produced this graph.

00:14:04.309 --> 00:14:06.795
Now that gave you a lot of information while someone

00:14:06.795 --> 00:14:10.036
was typing, and what they did then is used advanced

00:14:10.036 --> 00:14:13.043
artificial intelligence techniques called machine learning

00:14:13.043 --> 00:14:14.474
to have a training phase,

00:14:14.474 --> 00:14:16.710
and so they got most likely grad students

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.499
to type in a whole lot of things, and to learn,

00:14:20.499 --> 00:14:23.267
to have the system use the machine learning tools that

00:14:23.267 --> 00:14:26.130
were available to learn what it is that the people were typing

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.957
and to match that up

00:14:28.957 --> 00:14:31.434
with the measurements in the accelerometer.

00:14:31.434 --> 00:14:33.069
And then there's the attack phase, where you get

00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:35.880
somebody to type something in, you don't know what it was,

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.177
but you use your model that you created

00:14:37.177 --> 00:14:40.619
in the training phase to figure out what they were typing.

00:14:40.619 --> 00:14:44.103
They had pretty good success. This is an article from the USA Today.

00:14:44.103 --> 00:14:46.712
They typed in, "The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled

00:14:46.712 --> 00:14:49.674
that Rahm Emanuel is eligible to run for Mayor of Chicago"

00:14:49.674 --> 00:14:51.028
— see, I tied it in to the last talk —

00:14:51.028 --> 00:14:53.146
"and ordered him to stay on the ballot."

00:14:53.146 --> 00:14:55.917
Now, the system is interesting, because it produced

00:14:55.917 --> 00:14:58.803
"Illinois Supreme" and then it wasn't sure.

00:14:58.803 --> 00:15:00.753
The model produced a bunch of options,

00:15:00.753 --> 00:15:03.462
and this is the beauty of some of the A.I. techniques,

00:15:03.462 --> 00:15:05.712
is that computers are good at some things,

00:15:05.712 --> 00:15:07.246
humans are good at other things,

00:15:07.246 --> 00:15:09.177
take the best of both and let the humans solve this one.

00:15:09.177 --> 00:15:10.559
Don't waste computer cycles.

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:12.695
A human's not going to think it's the Supreme might.

00:15:12.695 --> 00:15:14.435
It's the Supreme Court, right?

00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:16.965
And so, together we're able to reproduce typing

00:15:16.965 --> 00:15:19.914
simply by measuring the accelerometer.

00:15:19.914 --> 00:15:23.416
Why does this matter? Well, in the Android platform,

00:15:23.416 --> 00:15:27.549
for example, the developers have a manifest

00:15:27.564 --> 00:15:30.148
where every device on there, the microphone, etc.,

00:15:30.148 --> 00:15:32.104
has to register if you're going to use it

00:15:32.104 --> 00:15:34.420
so that hackers can't take over it,

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.528
but nobody controls the accelerometer.

00:15:37.528 --> 00:15:39.744
So what's the point? You can leave your iPhone next to

00:15:39.744 --> 00:15:41.850
someone's keyboard, and just leave the room,

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.489
and then later recover what they did,

00:15:43.489 --> 00:15:45.200
even without using the microphone.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.374
If someone is able to put malware on your iPhone,

00:15:47.374 --> 00:15:50.222
they could then maybe get the typing that you do

00:15:50.222 --> 00:15:52.543
whenever you put your iPhone next to your keyboard.

00:15:52.543 --> 00:15:54.814
There's several other notable attacks that unfortunately

00:15:54.814 --> 00:15:56.945
I don't have time to go into, but the one that I wanted

00:15:56.945 --> 00:15:59.222
to point out was a group from the University of Michigan

00:15:59.222 --> 00:16:01.663
which was able to take voting machines,

00:16:01.663 --> 00:16:04.161
the Sequoia AVC Edge DREs that

00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:05.716
were going to be used in New Jersey in the election

00:16:05.716 --> 00:16:07.877
that were left in a hallway, and put Pac-Man on it.

00:16:07.877 --> 00:16:11.500
So they ran the Pac-Man game.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.247
What does this all mean?

00:16:13.247 --> 00:16:16.894
Well, I think that society tends to adopt technology

00:16:16.894 --> 00:16:19.718
really quickly. I love the next coolest gadget.

00:16:19.718 --> 00:16:22.332
But it's very important, and these researchers are showing,

00:16:22.332 --> 00:16:23.692
that the developers of these things

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:26.557
need to take security into account from the very beginning,

00:16:26.557 --> 00:16:29.342
and need to realize that they may have a threat model,

00:16:29.342 --> 00:16:31.804
but the attackers may not be nice enough

00:16:31.804 --> 00:16:33.581
to limit themselves to that threat model,

00:16:33.581 --> 00:16:36.118
and so you need to think outside of the box.

00:16:36.118 --> 00:16:37.696
What we can do is be aware

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:40.175
that devices can be compromised,

00:16:40.175 --> 00:16:41.874
and anything that has software in it

00:16:41.874 --> 00:16:44.523
is going to be vulnerable. It's going to have bugs.

00:16:44.523 --> 00:16:48.020
Thank you very much. (Applause)
