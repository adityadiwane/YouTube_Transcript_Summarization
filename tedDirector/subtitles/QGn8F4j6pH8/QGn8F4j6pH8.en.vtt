00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Being a child, and sort of crawling around the house,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
I remember these Turkish carpets,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.160
and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.160
I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.160
from this soldier.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
And my mom took these pictures actually, last week,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.160
There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
with creatures and gargoyles and nudity --

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.160
so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.160
And then there was another influence.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
we want to just do what we love and what we believe in.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
And so,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
I fused together the two things I loved the most,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
which was skiing and windsurfing.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.160
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
So, I created this compilation of the two:

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.160
I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
and some foot straps, and some metal fins,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
and here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
It was really a death trap. I mean, it was incredible,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
And I realized then I had to go to design school.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.160
(Laughter)

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
I mean, look at those graphics there.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
(Laughter)

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.160
So, I went to design school,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.160
and it was the early '90s when I finished.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.160
so I wanted to be there,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.160
and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.160
and we would get in to these meetings,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
and these managers would come in,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
and they would say,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
"Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
And they would give the projects code names, you know,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.160
mostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
So, in anticipation, I would be this young designer

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
in the back of the room, and I would raise my hand,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
and I would ask questions.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
I mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.160
but things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?"

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.160
or "What's this Num Lock key for?" You know, that thing?

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160
"You know, do people really use it?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
Do they need it? Do they want it in their homes?"

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
(Laughter)

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.160
What I realized then is, they didn't really want to change

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
the legacy stuff; they didn't want to change the insides.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.160
They were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
to put some pretty stuff outside of the box.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
And I didn't want to be a colorist.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
It wasn't what I wanted to do.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
I didn't want to be a stylist in this way.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
And then I saw this quote:

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.160
"advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
(Laughter)

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
So, I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
and I started a little company, fuseproject.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.160
And so the first projects were sort of humble,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.160
but they took technology and maybe made it into things

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160
that people would use in a new way,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.160
and maybe finding some new functionality.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160
This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.160
right when it launched,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
and it's the first watch that has a display

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
that switches from horizontal to vertical.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.160
And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.160
without bending my elbow.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
And other projects, which were really about transformation,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
about matching the human need.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
and it ships completely flat,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.160
and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160
And something a little bit more experimental:

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
this is a light fixture for Swarovski,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
and what it does is, it changes shape.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
And just by drawing on a little computer tablet,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.160
the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
This is a pretty involved process;

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
it took us about four and a half years.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.160
But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.160
a new experience of light.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.160
So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.160
And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
And the new experience I was looking for

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
is giving the choice for the user to go from

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
all the way to a bright work light.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
So, the light bulb actually does that.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
It allows the person to switch,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
and to mix these two colorations.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
And it's done in a very simple way:

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
one just touches the base of the light,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
and on one side, you can mix the brightness,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
and on the other, the coloration of the light.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.160
So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
and I think as designers we need to really think

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.160
about how we can create a different relationship

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
between our work and the world,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.160
whether it's for business,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.160
or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.160
Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.160
value to business, value to the users also,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.160
but I think it's the values that we put into these projects

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
that ultimately create the greater value.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.160
And the values we bring

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.160
can be about environmental issues,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
about sustainability, about lower power consumption.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.160
You know, they can be about function and beauty;

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.160
they can be about business strategy.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
But designers are really the glue

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
that brings these things together.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.160
So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
and it has a humanistic technology.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
It feels your skin. It rests on your skin,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.160
and it knows when it is you're talking.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
And by knowing when it is you're talking,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160
it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
which is the environmental noises.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.160
is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
and all the nerdy stuff out of it,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
and try to make it as beautiful as we can.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160
I mean, think about it:

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.160
the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.160
or accessories is really important,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
And this is what we're pursuing here.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
I want to point at something here, on the left.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.160
This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160
that makes this technology work.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
But this is the design process:

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.160
there's somebody changing the board,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.160
putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
as the designers on the other side are doing the work.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.160
So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
It's really about designing from the inside out.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
And then, on the other side of the room,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.160
the designers are making small adjustments,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.160
sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.160
And it's what I call being design driven.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.160
You know, there is some push and pull,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
but design is really helping define

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
the whole experience from the inside out.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
And then, of course, design is never done.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.160
And this is -- the other new way that is unique

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
in how we work is, because it's never done,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
you have to do all this other stuff.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
The packaging, and the website, and you need to continue

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
to really touch the user, in many ways.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.160
But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:50.160
And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160
you know, really understands that you need a different structure.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.160
it's a partnership. We can continue to work

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
and dedicate ourselves to this project,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
and then we also share in the rewards.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.160
And here's another project, another partnership-type approach.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
This is called Y Water,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
Austrian originally, who came to us,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.160
and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink,

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
or an organic drink for his kids,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
to replace the high-sugar-content sodas

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
that he's trying to get them away from.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
So, we worked on this bottle,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:45.160
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.160
The bottles connect together,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.160
and you can create different shapes, different forms.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.160
(Laughter)

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.160
(Applause)

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.160
Thank you.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.160
(Applause)

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.160
And then while we were doing this,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.160
the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.160
and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not,"

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
are probably the most important words that kids ask.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160
So we called it Y Water. And so this is

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
another place where it all comes together in the same room:

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:22.160
the three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
it all becomes deeply connected.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
And then the other thing about this project is,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.160
we bring intellectual property,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
we bring a marketing approach,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
what we bring is these values,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.160
And it's especially rewarding when your design work

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
becomes a creative endeavor,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.160
when others can be creative and do more with it.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.160
Here's another project,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
which I think really emulates that.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:56.160
This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.160
This picture is incredible.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.160
In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
I mean, to me, it just means so much.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160
But when Nicholas Negroponte --

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160
and he has spoken about this project a lot,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.160
he's the founder of OLPC -- came to us

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
about two and a half years ago,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
there were some clear ideas.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.160
and those are pillars of his life,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.160
but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.160
But the third pillar that he talked about was design.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.160
And at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160
I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
But what he said was really significant,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
is that design was going to be why the kids

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160
were going to love this product,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
how we were going to make it low cost, robust.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:02.160
And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key --

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
(Laughter) --

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.160
and the Num Lock key, too.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.160
So, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.160
to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.160
And then the integration of

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.160
all these great technologies, which you've heard about,

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect;

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.160
the screen, which you can read in sunlight;

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
the keyboard, which is made out of rubber,

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
and it's protected from the environment.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
You know, all these great technologies really happened

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.160
because of the passion and

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
the OLPC people and the engineers.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
They fought the suppliers,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.160
they fought the manufacturers.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
I mean, they fought like animals

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.160
for this to remain they way it is.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.160
And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one --

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.160
allows the process

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
from not destroying the original idea.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
And I think this is something really important.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
So, now you get these pictures --

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.160
and you see them in Uruguay

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.160
with their computers, and in Mongolia.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.160
And we went away from obviously the beige.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.160
I mean it's colorful, it's fun.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.160
In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
It's because we were able

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.160
to run, during the manufacturing process,

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.160
20 colors for the X and the O,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
which is the name of the computer,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160
you get 20 times 20: you get

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
400 different options there.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
So, the lessons from seeing the kids

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160
using them in the developing world are incredible.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
and he had the laptop for an afternoon,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
and I had to take it back. It was hard.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.160
(Laughter)

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.160
And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.160
I come back to Switzerland,

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.160
and there he is playing with his own version.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.160
(Laughter)

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
Like paper, paper and cardboard.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.160
So, I'm going to finish with one last project,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
and this is a little bit more of adult play.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160
(Laughter)

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.160
Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.160
It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
February 14, about 10 days ago.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.160
So, the Department of Health in New York came to us,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.160
and they needed a way to distribute

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.160
36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.160
So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.160
It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.160
and it has to be easily serviceable:

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160
you have to know where it is and what it does.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.160
And we also designed the condoms themselves.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.160
And I was just in New York at the launch,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.160
and I went to see all these places where they're installed:

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.160
this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store;

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
Of course, clubs and discos, too.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.160
And here's the public service announcement for this project.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:59.160
(Music)

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.160
(Laughter)

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160
Get some.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:09.160
(Applause)

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.160
So, this is really where design

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.160
is able to create a conversation.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160
I was in these venues, and people were,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.160
you know, really into getting them. They were excited.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.160
It was breaking the ice,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160
it was getting over a stigma,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.160
and I think that's also what design can do.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.160
So, I was going to

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.160
throw some condoms in the room and whatnot,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.160
but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.160
(Laughter)

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.160
Yeah? All right, all right. I have only a few.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160
(Laughter)

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.160
(Applause)

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:55.160
So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.160
(Laughter)

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.160
And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom,

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160
you can just say you like the design.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.160
(Laughter)

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.160
So, I'll finish with just one thought:

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.160
if we all work together on creating value,

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.160
but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:21.160
I think we can change the work that we do.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160
We can change these values, can change the companies we work with,

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.160
and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.160
So, thank you.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:38.160
(Applause)
