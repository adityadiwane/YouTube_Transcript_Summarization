00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.260
The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.676
in something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics,

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:26.360
dating back to at least before Adam Smith.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.844
And that is, why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:35.093
can display radically different savings behavior?

00:00:35.093 --> 00:00:39.627
Now, many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question,

00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:43.044
and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway

00:00:43.044 --> 00:00:45.477
and we understand a lot about this.

00:00:45.477 --> 00:00:49.111
What I'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:53.143
and some surprisingly powerful new findings that I've been working on

00:00:53.143 --> 00:00:57.849
about the link between the structure of the language you speak

00:00:57.864 --> 00:01:02.260
and how you find yourself with the propensity to save.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.327
Let me tell you a little bit about savings rates, a little bit about language,

00:01:05.327 --> 00:01:07.677
and then I'll draw that connection.

00:01:07.677 --> 00:01:12.244
Let's start by thinking about the member countries of the OECD,

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:15.545
or the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:19.444
OECD countries, by and large, you should think about these

00:01:19.444 --> 00:01:22.082
as the richest, most industrialized countries in the world.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:26.132
And by joining the OECD, they were affirming a common commitment

00:01:26.132 --> 00:01:29.570
to democracy, open markets and free trade.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.255
Despite all of these similarities, we see huge differences in savings behavior.

00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:36.705
So all the way over on the left of this graph,

00:01:36.705 --> 00:01:41.439
what you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year,

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.120
and some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.888
Holding down the right flank of the OECD, all the way on the other side, is Greece.

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:54.304
And what you can see is that over the last 25 years,

00:01:54.304 --> 00:01:58.204
Greece has barely managed to save more than 10 percent of their GDP.

00:01:58.204 --> 00:02:05.078
It should be noted, of course, that the United States and the U.K. are the next in line.

00:02:05.078 --> 00:02:07.656
Now that we see these huge differences in savings rates,

00:02:07.656 --> 00:02:11.322
how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences?

00:02:11.322 --> 00:02:14.371
Let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ.

00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:19.938
Linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now.

00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:24.548
And then I'll draw the connection between these two behaviors.

00:02:24.548 --> 00:02:27.156
Many of you have probably already noticed that I'm Chinese.

00:02:27.156 --> 00:02:30.121
I grew up in the Midwest of the United States.

00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:32.572
And something I realized quite early on

00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:36.163
was that the Chinese language forced me to speak about and --

00:02:36.163 --> 00:02:39.054
in fact, more fundamentally than that --

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:43.144
ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways.

00:02:43.144 --> 00:02:45.221
Now, how might that be? Let me give you an example.

00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:49.623
Suppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle.

00:02:49.623 --> 00:02:52.489
You understood exactly what I just said in English.

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.439
If we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other, though,

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.505
I wouldn't have that luxury.

00:02:57.505 --> 00:03:00.338
I wouldn't have been able to convey so little information.

00:03:00.338 --> 00:03:02.722
What my language would have forced me to do,

00:03:02.722 --> 00:03:04.722
instead of just telling you, "This is my uncle,"

00:03:04.722 --> 00:03:08.004
is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information.

00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:09.823
My language would force me to tell you

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:13.239
whether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side,

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.323
whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth,

00:03:16.323 --> 00:03:18.555
and if this man was my father's brother,

00:03:18.555 --> 00:03:21.339
whether he was older than or younger than my father.

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:25.472
All of this information is obligatory. Chinese doesn't let me ignore it.

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:27.638
And in fact, if I want to speak correctly,

00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:30.755
Chinese forces me to constantly think about it.

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:34.704
Now, that fascinated me endlessly as a child,

00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:37.939
but what fascinates me even more today as an economist

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:43.240
is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.489
So for example, if I'm speaking in English, I have to speak grammatically differently

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.222
if I'm talking about past rain, "It rained yesterday,"

00:03:50.222 --> 00:03:52.454
current rain, "It is raining now,"

00:03:52.454 --> 00:03:54.888
or future rain, "It will rain tomorrow."

00:03:54.888 --> 00:03:59.715
Notice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events.

00:03:59.715 --> 00:04:01.722
Why? Because I have to consider that

00:04:01.722 --> 00:04:06.505
and I have to modify what I'm saying to say, "It will rain," or "It's going to rain."

00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:10.621
It's simply not permissible in English to say, "It rain tomorrow."

00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:14.805
In contrast to that, that's almost exactly what you would say in Chinese.

00:04:14.805 --> 00:04:17.121
A Chinese speaker can basically say something

00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:19.705
that sounds very strange to an English speaker's ears.

00:04:19.705 --> 00:04:24.272
They can say, "Yesterday it rain," "Now it rain," "Tomorrow it rain."

00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:28.135
In some deep sense, Chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:34.568
in the same way that English forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly.

00:04:34.568 --> 00:04:36.152
Is this difference in languages

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:40.347
only between very, very distantly related languages, like English and Chinese?

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:41.305
Actually, no.

00:04:41.305 --> 00:04:45.038
So many of you know, in this room, that English is a Germanic language.

00:04:45.038 --> 00:04:48.953
What you may not have realized is that English is actually an outlier.

00:04:48.953 --> 00:04:52.203
It is the only Germanic language that requires this.

00:04:52.203 --> 00:04:55.087
For example, most other Germanic language speakers

00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:58.104
feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow

00:04:58.104 --> 00:05:00.070
by saying, "Morgen regnet es,"

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.970
quite literally to an English ear, "It rain tomorrow."

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.037
This led me, as a behavioral economist, to an intriguing hypothesis.

00:05:09.037 --> 00:05:13.286
Could how you speak about time, could how your language forces you to think about time,

00:05:13.286 --> 00:05:17.037
affect your propensity to behave across time?

00:05:17.037 --> 00:05:19.937
You speak English, a futured language.

00:05:19.937 --> 00:05:23.104
And what that means is that every time you discuss the future,

00:05:23.104 --> 00:05:24.671
or any kind of a future event,

00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:28.070
grammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.703
and treat it as if it's something viscerally different.

00:05:30.703 --> 00:05:33.203
Now suppose that that visceral difference

00:05:33.203 --> 00:05:37.403
makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak.

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:39.316
If that's true and it makes the future feel

00:05:39.316 --> 00:05:42.299
like something more distant and more different from the present,

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:44.953
that's going to make it harder to save.

00:05:44.953 --> 00:05:47.504
If, on the other hand, you speak a futureless language,

00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:50.887
the present and the future, you speak about them identically.

00:05:50.887 --> 00:05:53.870
If that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically,

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.254
that's going to make it easier to save.

00:05:56.254 --> 00:05:58.804
Now this is a fanciful theory.

00:05:58.804 --> 00:06:01.704
I'm a professor, I get paid to have fanciful theories.

00:06:01.704 --> 00:06:05.938
But how would you actually go about testing such a theory?

00:06:05.938 --> 00:06:10.004
Well, what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature.

00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:14.387
And interestingly enough, there are pockets of futureless language speakers

00:06:14.387 --> 00:06:16.320
situated all over the world.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.686
This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe.

00:06:19.686 --> 00:06:22.587
Interestingly enough, when you start to crank the data,

00:06:22.587 --> 00:06:25.820
these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.754
turn out to be, by and large, some of the world's best savers.

00:06:29.754 --> 00:06:31.920
Just to give you a hint of that,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.670
let's look back at that OECD graph that we were talking about.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.054
What you see is that these bars are systematically taller

00:06:38.054 --> 00:06:40.186
and systematically shifted to the left

00:06:40.186 --> 00:06:44.704
compared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages.

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.167
What is the average difference here?

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:49.453
Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year.

00:06:49.453 --> 00:06:54.187
Over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation.

00:06:54.187 --> 00:06:56.887
Now while these findings are suggestive,

00:06:56.887 --> 00:06:58.953
countries can be different in so many different ways

00:06:58.953 --> 00:07:03.337
that it's very, very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences.

00:07:03.337 --> 00:07:07.369
What I'm going to show you, though, is something that I've been engaging in for a year,

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:09.692
which is trying to gather all of the largest datasets

00:07:09.692 --> 00:07:11.984
that we have access to as economists,

00:07:11.984 --> 00:07:15.366
and I'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences,

00:07:15.366 --> 00:07:18.020
hoping to get this relationship to break.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.051
And just in summary, no matter how far I push this, I can't get it to break.

00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:24.816
Let me show you how far you can do that.

00:07:24.816 --> 00:07:29.449
One way to imagine that is I gather large datasets from around the world.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.183
So for example, there is the Survey of Health, [Aging] and Retirement in Europe.

00:07:33.183 --> 00:07:37.017
From this dataset you actually learn that retired European families

00:07:37.017 --> 00:07:39.650
are extremely patient with survey takers.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.566
(Laughter)

00:07:41.566 --> 00:07:45.950
So imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.534
"Excuse me, would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio?

00:07:50.534 --> 00:07:54.066
Do you happen to know how much your house is worth? Do you mind telling me?

00:07:54.066 --> 00:07:57.333
Would you happen to have a hallway that's more than 10 meters long?

00:07:57.333 --> 00:08:01.834
If you do, would you mind if I timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway?

00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:05.731
Would you mind squeezing as hard as you can, in your dominant hand, this device

00:08:05.731 --> 00:08:07.243
so I can measure your grip strength?

00:08:07.243 --> 00:08:11.266
How about blowing into this tube so I can measure your lung capacity?"

00:08:11.266 --> 00:08:14.150
The survey takes over a day.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.633
(Laughter)

00:08:15.633 --> 00:08:19.533
Combine that with a Demographic and Health Survey

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:23.983
collected by USAID in developing countries in Africa, for example,

00:08:23.983 --> 00:08:29.134
which that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the HIV status

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:32.233
of families living in, for example, rural Nigeria.

00:08:32.233 --> 00:08:34.134
Combine that with a world value survey,

00:08:34.134 --> 00:08:38.567
which measures the political opinions and, fortunately for me, the savings behaviors

00:08:38.567 --> 00:08:43.266
of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world.

00:08:43.266 --> 00:08:47.084
Take all of that data, combine it, and this map is what you get.

00:08:47.084 --> 00:08:49.334
What you find is nine countries around the world

00:08:49.334 --> 00:08:51.986
that have significant native populations

00:08:51.986 --> 00:08:56.033
which speak both futureless and futured languages.

00:08:56.033 --> 00:08:59.567
And what I'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs

00:08:59.567 --> 00:09:05.160
between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that I can measure,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.697
and then I'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds

00:09:08.697 --> 00:09:12.180
even after controlling for all of these levels.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.397
What are the characteristics we can control for?

00:09:14.397 --> 00:09:17.161
Well I'm going to match families on country of birth and residence,

00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:19.563
the demographics -- what sex, their age --

00:09:19.563 --> 00:09:21.697
their income level within their own country,

00:09:21.697 --> 00:09:24.712
their educational achievement, a lot about their family structure.

00:09:24.712 --> 00:09:28.230
It turns out there are six different ways to be married in Europe.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.430
And most granularly, I break them down by religion

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.745
where there are 72 categories of religions in the world --

00:09:35.745 --> 00:09:37.462
so an extreme level of granularity.

00:09:37.462 --> 00:09:41.995
There are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself.

00:09:41.995 --> 00:09:46.044
Now effectively everything I'm going to tell you from now on

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:49.094
is only comparing these basically nearly identical families.

00:09:49.094 --> 00:09:51.594
It's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment

00:09:51.594 --> 00:09:54.527
of finding two families both of whom live in Brussels

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:57.527
who are identical on every single one of these dimensions,

00:09:57.527 --> 00:10:00.643
but one of whom speaks Flemish and one of whom speaks French;

00:10:00.643 --> 00:10:03.360
or two families that live in a rural district in Nigeria,

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.193
one of whom speaks Hausa and one of whom speaks Igbo.

00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:11.077
Now even after all of this granular level of control,

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:14.243
do futureless language speakers seem to save more?

00:10:14.243 --> 00:10:17.896
Yes, futureless language speakers, even after this level of control,

00:10:17.896 --> 00:10:21.594
are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year.

00:10:21.594 --> 00:10:23.410
Does this have cumulative effects?

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.830
Yes, by the time they retire, futureless language speakers, holding constant their income,

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.898
are going to retire with 25 percent more in savings.

00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:33.379
Can we push this data even further?

00:10:33.379 --> 00:10:38.678
Yes, because I just told you, we actually collect a lot of health data as economists.

00:10:38.678 --> 00:10:42.561
Now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings?

00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:45.394
Well, think about smoking, for example.

00:10:45.394 --> 00:10:48.577
Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings.

00:10:48.577 --> 00:10:52.243
If savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure,

00:10:52.243 --> 00:10:53.551
smoking is just the opposite.

00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:56.410
It's current pleasure in exchange for future pain.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.360
What we should expect then is the opposite effect.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.128
And that's exactly what we find.

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:04.895
Futureless language speakers are 20 to 24 percent less likely

00:11:04.895 --> 00:11:08.310
to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families,

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.211
and they're going to be 13 to 17 percent less likely

00:11:11.211 --> 00:11:13.428
to be obese by the time they retire,

00:11:13.428 --> 00:11:15.891
and they're going to report being 21 percent more likely

00:11:15.891 --> 00:11:18.178
to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:21.661
I could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find.

00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:25.461
It's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior

00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:28.060
for which this strong effect isn't present.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:32.810
My linguistics and economics colleagues at Yale and I are just starting to do this work

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:37.977
and really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges

00:11:37.977 --> 00:11:43.372
cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak.

00:11:43.372 --> 00:11:45.673
Ultimately, the goal,

00:11:45.673 --> 00:11:49.872
once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making,

00:11:49.872 --> 00:11:52.822
we want to be able to provide people tools

00:11:52.822 --> 00:11:55.630
so that they can consciously make themselves better savers

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.889
and more conscious investors in their own future.

00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:01.156
Thank you very much.

00:12:01.156 --> 00:12:07.524
