Reviewer: Thu-Huong Ha

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.648
I'm going to start
on a slightly somber note.

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:22.683
Two thousand and seven, five years ago,

00:00:22.707 --> 00:00:25.728
my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.602
Stage IIB.

00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:32.355
Now, looking back, the most
harrowing part of that experience

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.186
was not just the hospital visits --

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.022
these were very painful
for my wife, understandably so.

00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:40.901
It was not even the initial shock
of knowing that she had breast cancer

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:42.076
at just 39 years old,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.541
absolutely no history
of cancer in her family.

00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:49.660
The most horrifying and agonizing part
of the whole experience

00:00:49.684 --> 00:00:53.451
was we were making decisions
after decisions after decisions

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:55.070
that were being thrust upon us.

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:58.256
Should it be a mastectomy?
Should it be a lumpectomy?

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.880
Should it be a more
aggressive form of treatment,

00:01:00.904 --> 00:01:02.417
given that it was stage IIB?

00:01:02.774 --> 00:01:04.049
With all the side effects?

00:01:04.073 --> 00:01:06.586
Or should it be a less
aggressive form of treatment?

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:10.753
And these were being thrust
upon us by the doctors.

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:13.282
Now you could ask this question,

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.844
why were the doctors doing this?

00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:16.327
A simplistic answer would be,

00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:17.608
the doctors are doing this

00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:20.225
because they want to protect
themselves legally.

00:01:21.153 --> 00:01:22.836
I think that is too simplistic.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.376
These are well-meaning doctors,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.035
some of them have gone on
to become very good friends.

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:29.212
They probably were simply
following the wisdom

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:30.989
that has come down through the ages,

00:01:31.013 --> 00:01:33.128
this adage that when
you're making decisions,

00:01:33.152 --> 00:01:34.834
especially decisions of importance,

00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:37.401
it's best to be in charge,
it's best to be in control,

00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:39.423
it's best to be in the driver's seat.

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:42.477
And we were certainly
in the driver's seat,

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:43.811
making all these decisions.

00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:46.429
And let me tell you --
if some of you have been there,

00:01:46.453 --> 00:01:48.874
it was a most agonizing
and harrowing experience.

00:01:49.937 --> 00:01:51.091
Which got me thinking.

00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:54.400
I said, is there any validity
to this whole adage

00:01:54.424 --> 00:01:56.488
that when you're making decisions,

00:01:56.512 --> 00:01:58.609
it's best to take the driver's seat,

00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:00.015
be in charge, be in control?

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.827
Or are there contexts
where we're far better off

00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:05.333
taking the passenger's seat

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:06.707
and have someone else drive?

00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:08.713
For example, a trusted financial advisor,

00:02:08.737 --> 00:02:10.349
could be a trusted doctor, etc.

00:02:11.483 --> 00:02:14.076
And since I study human decision making,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.553
I said, I'm going to run some studies

00:02:16.577 --> 00:02:18.033
to find some answers.

00:02:18.057 --> 00:02:20.999
And I'm going to share one
of these studies with you today.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.371
So, imagine that all of you
are participants in the study.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:28.639
I want to tell you that
what you're going to do in the study is,

00:02:28.663 --> 00:02:30.669
you're going to drink a cup of tea.

00:02:31.176 --> 00:02:34.629
If you're wondering why, I'll tell you why
in a few seconds from now.

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:36.978
You are going to solve
a series of puzzles,

00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:40.907
and I'm going to show you examples
of these puzzles momentarily.

00:02:41.462 --> 00:02:42.960
And the more puzzles you solve,

00:02:42.984 --> 00:02:45.601
the greater the chances
that you'll win some prizes.

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:48.345
Now, why do you have to consume the tea?

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:50.188
Why? Because it makes a lot of sense:

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:53.426
In order to solve these puzzles
effectively, if you think about it,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.848
your mind needs to be in two states
simultaneously, right?

00:02:57.221 --> 00:02:59.368
It needs to be alert,

00:02:59.392 --> 00:03:00.995
for which caffeine is very good.

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:04.783
Simultaneously, it needs to be calm --

00:03:04.807 --> 00:03:06.530
not agitated, calm --

00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:08.373
for which chamomile is very good.

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:13.432
Now comes the between-subjects design,

00:03:13.456 --> 00:03:15.267
the AB design, the AB testing.

00:03:15.291 --> 00:03:18.988
So what I'm going to do is randomly
assign you to one of two groups.

00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:21.609
So imagine that there is
an imaginary line out here,

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:24.817
so everyone here will be group A,

00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:26.649
everyone out here will be group B.

00:03:27.687 --> 00:03:32.375
Now, for you folks, what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you these two teas,

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.591
and I'll go ahead and ask you
to choose your tea.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.583
So you can choose whichever tea you want.

00:03:37.607 --> 00:03:39.757
You can decide, what is your mental state:

00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:41.393
OK, I choose the caffeinated tea,

00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:42.708
I choose the chamomile tea.

00:03:42.732 --> 00:03:45.718
So you're going to be in charge,
you're going to be in control,

00:03:45.742 --> 00:03:48.104
you're going to be in the driver's seat.

00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:51.281
You folks, I'm going to show you
these two teas,

00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:52.932
but you don't have a choice.

00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:55.460
I'm going to give you
one of these two teas,

00:03:55.484 --> 00:03:58.182
and keep in mind, I'm going
to pick one of these two teas

00:03:58.206 --> 00:03:59.601
at random for you.

00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:00.907
And you know that.

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:04.273
So if you think about it,
this is an extreme-case scenario,

00:04:04.297 --> 00:04:05.583
because in the real world,

00:04:05.607 --> 00:04:07.604
whenever you are taking passenger's seat,

00:04:07.628 --> 00:04:10.224
very often the driver is going
to be someone you trust,

00:04:10.248 --> 00:04:11.471
an expert, etc.

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:13.328
So this is an extreme-case scenario.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.256
Now, you're all going to consume the tea.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.319
So imagine that you're taking the tea now,

00:04:21.343 --> 00:04:23.123
we'll wait for you to finish the tea.

00:04:23.147 --> 00:04:27.003
We'll give another five minutes
for the ingredient to have its effects.

00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:31.811
Now you're going to have
30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles.

00:04:32.588 --> 00:04:35.189
Here's an example of the puzzle
you're going to solve.

00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:37.998
Anyone in the audience
want to take a stab?

00:04:38.022 --> 00:04:40.183
Audience member: Pulpit!
Baba Shiv: Whoa! OK.

00:04:40.207 --> 00:04:41.357
That's cool.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:44.385
Yeah, so what we'd do if we had
you who gave the answer

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.688
as a participant,

00:04:45.712 --> 00:04:47.870
we would have calibrated
the difficulty level

00:04:47.894 --> 00:04:49.977
of the puzzles to your expertise.

00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:52.326
Because we want
these puzzles to be difficult.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.565
These are tricky puzzles,

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:56.103
because your first instinct
is to say "tulip."

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.567
And then you have to unstick yourself.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.371
Right?

00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:03.110
So these have been calibrated
to your level of expertise,

00:05:03.134 --> 00:05:04.991
because we want this to be difficult,

00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:07.185
and I'll tell you why, momentarily.

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:08.940
Now, here's another example.

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.526
Anyone? This is much more difficult.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.566
Audience member: Embark.
BS: Yeah. Wow! OK.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.465
So, yeah, so this is, again, difficult.

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:18.322
You'll say "kamber," then you'll go,
"maker," and all that,

00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:19.976
and then you can unstick yourself.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.907
So you have 30 minutes now
to solve these 15 puzzles.

00:05:24.096 --> 00:05:28.157
Now, the question we're asking
here is, in terms of the outcome --

00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:30.776
and it comes in the number
of puzzles solved --

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.000
will you in the driver's seat
end up solving more puzzles

00:05:35.024 --> 00:05:36.327
because you are in control,

00:05:36.351 --> 00:05:38.509
you could decide which tea
you would choose,

00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:40.040
or would you be better off,

00:05:40.064 --> 00:05:42.150
in terms of the number of puzzles solved?

00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:45.640
And, systemically, what we will show,

00:05:45.664 --> 00:05:47.218
across a series of studies,

00:05:47.242 --> 00:05:49.536
is that you, the passengers,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.109
even though the tea
was picked for you at random,

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:56.004
will end up solving
more puzzles than you, the drivers.

00:05:57.385 --> 00:05:59.752
We also observe another thing,

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:02.534
and that is, you folks not only
are solving fewer puzzles,

00:06:02.558 --> 00:06:06.375
you're also putting less juice
into the task -- less effort,

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.065
you're less persistent, and so on.

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:09.240
How do we know that?

00:06:09.264 --> 00:06:11.559
Well, we have two objective measures.

00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:14.731
One is, what is the time,
on average, you're taking

00:06:14.755 --> 00:06:16.837
in attempting to solve these puzzles?

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:19.535
You will spend less time compared to you.

00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:22.047
Second, you have
30 minutes to solve these;

00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:23.809
are you taking the entire 30 minutes

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:26.222
or are you giving up
before the 30 minutes elapse?

00:06:26.246 --> 00:06:29.320
You will be more likely to give up
before the 30 minutes elapse,

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.336
compared to you.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.992
So you're putting in less juice,

00:06:33.016 --> 00:06:35.451
and therefore, the outcome:
fewer puzzles solved.

00:06:36.991 --> 00:06:41.026
That brings us now to:
why does this happen?

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.649
And under what situations -- when --
would we see this pattern of results

00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:49.364
where the passenger is going to show
better, more favorable outcomes,

00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:50.821
compared to the driver?

00:06:52.027 --> 00:06:56.261
It all has to do with when you face
what I call the INCA.

00:06:57.618 --> 00:07:01.521
It's an acronym that stands for the nature
of the feedback you're getting

00:07:01.545 --> 00:07:03.080
after you made the decision.

00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:06.323
So if you think about it,
in this particular puzzle task --

00:07:06.347 --> 00:07:08.671
it could happen in investing
in the stock market,

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:09.849
very volatile out there,

00:07:09.873 --> 00:07:11.675
it could be the medical situation --

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:13.342
the feedback here is immediate.

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:16.647
You know the feedback,
whether you're solving the puzzles or not.

00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:19.282
Right? Second, it is negative.

00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:21.874
Remember, the deck
was stacked against you,

00:07:21.898 --> 00:07:24.366
in terms of the difficulty
level of these puzzles.

00:07:24.714 --> 00:07:26.728
And this can happen in the medical domain.

00:07:26.752 --> 00:07:28.854
For example, very early on
in the treatment,

00:07:28.878 --> 00:07:31.942
things are negative, the feedback,
before things become positive.

00:07:31.966 --> 00:07:33.988
Right? It can happen in the stock market.

00:07:34.012 --> 00:07:37.368
Volatile stock market, getting negative
feedback, it is also immediate.

00:07:37.392 --> 00:07:41.040
And the feedback in all these cases
is concrete, it's unambiguous;

00:07:41.064 --> 00:07:43.569
you know if you've solved
the puzzles or not.

00:07:43.593 --> 00:07:45.226
Now, the added one,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:50.704
apart from this immediacy,
negative, this concreteness --

00:07:50.728 --> 00:07:53.329
now you have a sense of agency.

00:07:54.264 --> 00:07:56.734
You were responsible for your decision.

00:07:57.234 --> 00:07:58.686
So what do you do?

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.214
You focus on the foregone option.

00:08:01.587 --> 00:08:03.239
You say, you know what?

00:08:03.263 --> 00:08:05.055
I should have chosen the other tea.

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:07.865
(Laughter)

00:08:08.682 --> 00:08:11.440
That casts your decision in doubt,

00:08:11.464 --> 00:08:13.766
reduces the confidence
you have in the decision,

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.146
the confidence you have
in the performance,

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.441
the performance in terms
of solving the puzzles.

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:20.519
And therefore less juice into the task,

00:08:20.543 --> 00:08:22.296
fewer puzzles solved

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.975
and less favorable outcomes
compared to you folks.

00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:28.995
And this can happen in the medical
domain, if you think about it, right?

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:31.138
A patient in the driver's
seat, for example.

00:08:31.162 --> 00:08:33.513
Less juice, which means
keeping herself or himself

00:08:33.537 --> 00:08:37.061
less physically fit, physically active
to hasten the recovery process,

00:08:37.085 --> 00:08:38.680
which is what is often advocated.

00:08:38.704 --> 00:08:40.315
You probably wouldn't do that.

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:46.816
And therefore, there are times
when you're facing the INCA,

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.757
when the feedback is going
to be immediate, negative, concrete

00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:52.377
and you have the sense of agency,

00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:55.856
where you're far better off
taking the passenger's seat

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.610
and have someone else drive.

00:08:58.864 --> 00:09:02.064
Now, I started off on a somber note.

00:09:02.088 --> 00:09:04.127
I want to finish up on a more upbeat note.

00:09:04.151 --> 00:09:07.261
It has now been five years,
slightly more than five years,

00:09:07.285 --> 00:09:12.846
and the good news, thank God,
is that the cancer is still in remission.

00:09:13.878 --> 00:09:15.603
So it all ends well.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:22.395
But one thing I didn't mention
was that very early on into her treatment,

00:09:22.419 --> 00:09:25.847
my wife and I decided
that we would take the passenger's seat.

00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:28.326
And that made so much of a difference

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.125
in terms of the peace of mind
that came with that;

00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:33.011
we could focus on her recovery.

00:09:33.035 --> 00:09:35.966
We let the doctors make all the decisions

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.498
and take the driver's seat.

00:09:38.196 --> 00:09:39.348
Thank you.

00:09:39.372 --> 00:09:43.378
(Applause)
