00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:18.767
Good afternoon.

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.236
There's a medical revolution
happening all around us,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.356
and it's one that's going
to help us conquer

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.380
some of society's most dreaded conditions,

00:00:26.404 --> 00:00:27.610
including cancer.

00:00:28.523 --> 00:00:31.895
The revolution is called angiogenesis,

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.880
and it's based on the process
that our bodies use to grow blood vessels.

00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:38.586
So why should we care about blood vessels?

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.418
Well, the human body
is literally packed with them --

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:44.426
60,000 miles worth in a typical adult.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.434
End to end, that would form a line
that would circle the earth twice.

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.046
The smallest blood vessels
are called capillaries.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.236
We've got 19 billion of them
in our bodies.

00:00:55.637 --> 00:00:58.420
And these are the vessels of life,

00:00:58.444 --> 00:01:01.874
and as I'll show you,
they can also be the vessels of death.

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:05.437
Now, the remarkable thing
about blood vessels

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:07.318
is that they have this ability

00:01:07.342 --> 00:01:10.055
to adapt to whatever environment
they're growing in.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.336
For example, in the liver,
they form channels to detoxify the blood;

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.091
in the lungs, they line air sacs
for gas exchange.

00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:17.854
In muscle, they corkscrew,

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:21.114
so that muscles can contract
without cutting off circulation.

00:01:21.138 --> 00:01:23.661
And in nerves, they course along
like power lines,

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:25.106
keeping those nerves alive.

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:27.740
We get most of these blood vessels

00:01:27.764 --> 00:01:29.661
when we're actually still in the womb.

00:01:30.026 --> 00:01:32.236
And what that means is that as adults,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.507
blood vessels don't normally grow.

00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:37.260
Except in a few special circumstances.

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:40.236
In women, blood vessels grow every month,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.077
to build the lining of the uterus.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.528
During pregnancy, they form the placenta,

00:01:44.552 --> 00:01:46.789
which connects mom and baby.

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.559
And after injury, blood vessels
actually have to grow under the scab

00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:53.236
in order to heal a wound.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.187
And this is actually what it looks like,

00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:58.627
hundreds of blood vessels, all growing
toward the center of the wound.

00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:02.168
So the body has the ability to regulate

00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:05.260
the amount of blood vessels
that are present at any given time.

00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:09.672
It does this through an elaborate
and elegant system of checks and balances,

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.561
stimulators and inhibitors
of angiogenesis,

00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:15.236
such that, when we need
a brief burst of blood vessels,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.236
the body can do this
by releasing stimulators,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.458
proteins called angiogenic factors,

00:02:20.482 --> 00:02:24.648
that act as natural fertilizer,
and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout.

00:02:24.672 --> 00:02:26.913
When those excess vessels
are no longer needed,

00:02:26.937 --> 00:02:29.524
the body prunes them back to baseline,

00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:32.548
using naturally-occurring
inhibitors of angiogenesis.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.553
There are other situations
where we start beneath the baseline,

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:40.229
and we need to grow more blood vessels,
just to get back to normal levels --

00:02:40.253 --> 00:02:41.756
for example, after an injury --

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.631
and the body can do that too,
but only to that normal level,

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:45.805
that set point.

00:02:46.372 --> 00:02:49.236
But what we now know,
is that for a number of diseases,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.645
there are defects in the system,

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.170
where the body can't prune back
extra blood vessels,

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:57.794
or can't grow enough new ones
in the right place at the right time.

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:01.969
And in these situations,
angiogenesis is out of balance.

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:04.381
And when angiogenesis is out of balance,

00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:06.159
a myriad of diseases result.

00:03:06.564 --> 00:03:10.236
For example, insufficient angiogenesis --
not enough blood vessels --

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.236
leads to wounds
that don't heal, heart attacks,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.875
legs without circulation,
death from stroke,

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:17.050
nerve damage.

00:03:17.717 --> 00:03:20.034
And on the other end,
excessive angiogenesis --

00:03:20.058 --> 00:03:22.235
too many blood vessels -- drives disease,

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:24.847
and we see this in cancer, blindness,

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.720
arthritis, obesity, Alzheimer's disease.

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:31.709
In total, there are more
than 70 major diseases

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:34.202
affecting more than a billion
people worldwide,

00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:37.194
that all look on the surface to be
different from one another,

00:03:37.218 --> 00:03:40.036
but all actually share
abnormal angiogenesis

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.781
as their common denominator.

00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:45.708
And this realization is allowing
us to re-conceptualize

00:03:45.732 --> 00:03:48.144
the way that we actually
approach these diseases,

00:03:48.168 --> 00:03:50.152
by controlling angiogenesis.

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:52.998
Now, I'm going to focus on cancer,

00:03:53.022 --> 00:03:56.489
because angiogenesis
is a hallmark of cancer --

00:03:56.513 --> 00:03:57.941
every type of cancer.

00:03:58.513 --> 00:03:59.667
So here we go.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:04.096
This is a tumor: dark, gray, ominous
mass growing inside a brain.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.369
And under the microscope,

00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:08.406
you can see hundreds
of these brown-stained blood vessels,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.477
capillaries that are feeding cancer cells,

00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:12.454
bringing oxygen and nutrients.

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.628
But cancers don't start out like this,

00:04:15.652 --> 00:04:18.538
and in fact, cancers don't start out
with a blood supply.

00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:22.587
They start out as small,
microscopic nests of cells,

00:04:22.611 --> 00:04:26.915
that can only grow to one half
a cubic millimeter in size.

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:28.794
That's the tip of a ballpoint pen.

00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:32.421
Then they can't get any larger
because they don't have a blood supply,

00:04:32.445 --> 00:04:34.600
so they don't have
enough oxygen or nutrients.

00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:37.949
In fact, we're probably forming
these microscopic cancers

00:04:37.973 --> 00:04:40.115
all the time in our body.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.701
Autopsy studies from people
who died in car accidents

00:04:43.725 --> 00:04:48.551
have shown that about 40 percent of women
between the ages of 40 and 50

00:04:48.575 --> 00:04:52.456
actually have microscopic
cancers in their breasts.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.821
About 50 percent of men
in their 50s and 60s

00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:57.374
have microscopic prostate cancers,

00:04:57.398 --> 00:05:01.065
and virtually 100 percent of us,
by the time we reach our 70s,

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:03.770
will have microscopic cancers
growing in our thyroid.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.236
Yet, without a blood supply,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.532
most of these cancers
will never become dangerous.

00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:12.873
Dr. Judah Folkman, who was my mentor

00:05:12.897 --> 00:05:15.293
and who was the pioneer
of the angiogenesis field,

00:05:15.317 --> 00:05:18.809
once called this "cancer without disease."

00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:22.690
So the body's ability
to balance angiogenesis,

00:05:22.714 --> 00:05:24.236
when it's working properly,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.516
prevents blood vessels
from feeding cancers.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.236
And this turns out to be

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.036
one of our most important
defense mechanisms

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.289
against cancer.

00:05:33.472 --> 00:05:35.733
In fact, if you actually
block angiogenesis

00:05:35.757 --> 00:05:38.526
and prevent blood vessels
from ever reaching cancer cells,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.951
tumors simply can't grow up.

00:05:39.975 --> 00:05:41.728
But once angiogenesis occurs,

00:05:41.752 --> 00:05:43.935
cancers can grow exponentially.

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:48.958
And this is actually how a cancer
goes from being harmless,

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:50.149
to being deadly.

00:05:50.918 --> 00:05:52.236
Cancer cells mutate,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.547
and they gain the ability to release
lots of those angiogenic factors,

00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:56.742
natural fertilizer,

00:05:56.766 --> 00:06:00.212
that tip the balance in favor
of blood vessels invading the cancer.

00:06:00.236 --> 00:06:02.236
And once those vessels invade the cancer,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.236
it can expand,
it can invade local tissues,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.561
and the same vessels
that are feeding tumors

00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:11.799
allow cancer cells to exit
into the circulation as metastases.

00:06:12.688 --> 00:06:15.442
And unfortunately,
this late stage of cancer

00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:19.426
is the one at which
it's most likely to be diagnosed,

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.465
when angiogenesis is already turned on,

00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:24.053
and cancer cells are growing like wild.

00:06:24.997 --> 00:06:29.102
So, if angiogenesis is a tipping point

00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:32.236
between a harmless cancer
and a harmful one,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.534
then one major part
of the angiogenesis revolution

00:06:35.558 --> 00:06:37.313
is a new approach to treating cancer

00:06:37.337 --> 00:06:39.114
by cutting off the blood supply.

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.377
We call this antiangiogenic therapy,

00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:45.679
and it's completely different
from chemotherapy,

00:06:45.703 --> 00:06:47.583
because it selectively aims

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:50.144
at the blood vessels
that are feeding the cancers.

00:06:50.644 --> 00:06:55.079
We can do this because tumor blood vessels
are unlike normal, healthy vessels

00:06:55.103 --> 00:06:56.893
we see in other places of the body --

00:06:56.917 --> 00:07:00.041
they're abnormal,
they're very poorly constructed,

00:07:00.065 --> 00:07:02.319
and because of that,
they're highly vulnerable

00:07:02.343 --> 00:07:04.152
to treatments that target them.

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:09.458
In effect, when we give cancer patients
antiangiogenic therapy --

00:07:09.482 --> 00:07:12.466
here, an experimental drug for a glioma,

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.236
which is a type of brain tumor --

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.042
you can see that there are
dramatic changes that occur

00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:18.868
when the tumor is being starved.

00:07:19.963 --> 00:07:21.867
Here's a woman with a breast cancer,

00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:24.815
being treated with the antiangiogenic
drug called Avastin,

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:26.807
which is FDA approved.

00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:29.524
And you can see
that the halo of blood flow

00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:31.533
disappears after treatment.

00:07:32.723 --> 00:07:36.236
Well, I've just shown you
two very different types of cancer

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.029
that both responded
to antiangiogenic therapy.

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:41.585
So a few years ago, I asked myself,

00:07:41.609 --> 00:07:45.545
"Can we take this one step further
and treat other cancers,

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:47.362
even in other species?"

00:07:49.148 --> 00:07:51.538
So here is a nine year-old
boxer named Milo,

00:07:51.562 --> 00:07:53.236
who had a very aggressive tumor

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.268
called a malignant neurofibroma
growing on his shoulder.

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:57.877
It invaded into his lungs.

00:07:57.901 --> 00:08:00.385
His veterinarian only gave him
three months to live.

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:03.236
So we created a cocktail
of antiangiogenic drugs

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.236
that could be mixed into his dog food,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.513
as well as an antiangiogenic cream,

00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:10.105
that could be applied
on the surface of the tumor.

00:08:10.537 --> 00:08:12.672
And within a few weeks of treatment,

00:08:12.696 --> 00:08:15.022
we were able to slow down
that cancer's growth,

00:08:15.046 --> 00:08:18.299
such that we were ultimately
able to extend Milo’s survival

00:08:18.323 --> 00:08:21.942
to six times what the veterinarian
had initially predicted,

00:08:21.966 --> 00:08:23.931
all with a very good quality of life.

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:27.236
And we've subsequently treated
more than 600 dogs.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.530
We have about a 60 percent response rate,

00:08:29.554 --> 00:08:31.966
and improved survival for these pets

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.744
that were about to be euthanized.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:37.819
So let me show you a couple
of even more interesting examples.

00:08:38.414 --> 00:08:40.739
This is 20-year-old dolphin
living in Florida,

00:08:40.763 --> 00:08:42.914
and she had these lesions in her mouth

00:08:42.938 --> 00:08:44.724
that, over the course of three years,

00:08:44.748 --> 00:08:47.330
developed into invasive
squamous cell cancers.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.330
So we created an antiangiogenic paste.

00:08:50.632 --> 00:08:54.236
We had it painted on top of the cancer
three times a week.

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:56.758
And over the course of seven months,

00:08:56.782 --> 00:08:58.496
the cancers completely disappeared,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.813
and the biopsies came back as normal.

00:09:02.893 --> 00:09:04.599
Here's a cancer growing on the lip

00:09:04.623 --> 00:09:06.591
of a Quarter Horse named Guinness.

00:09:06.615 --> 00:09:09.718
It's a very, very deadly type
of cancer called an angiosarcoma.

00:09:09.742 --> 00:09:11.710
It had already spread to his lymph nodes,

00:09:11.734 --> 00:09:14.758
so we used an antiangiogenic
skin cream for the lip,

00:09:14.782 --> 00:09:19.363
and the oral cocktail, so we could treat
from the inside as well as the outside.

00:09:19.387 --> 00:09:21.514
And over the course of six months,

00:09:21.538 --> 00:09:23.363
he experienced a complete remission.

00:09:24.593 --> 00:09:27.744
And here he is six years later,

00:09:27.768 --> 00:09:30.649
Guinness, with his very happy owner.

00:09:30.673 --> 00:09:33.236
(Applause)

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.113
Now obviously, antiangiogenic therapy
could be used for a wide range of cancers.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.795
And in fact, the first
pioneering treatments

00:09:40.819 --> 00:09:42.390
for people as well as dogs,

00:09:42.414 --> 00:09:44.050
are already becoming available.

00:09:44.074 --> 00:09:47.615
There are 12 different drugs,
11 different cancer types.

00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:49.236
But the real question is:

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.236
How well do these work in practice?

00:09:51.543 --> 00:09:54.656
So here's actually
the patient survival data

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.465
from eight different types of cancer.

00:09:56.489 --> 00:09:58.948
The bars represent survival time

00:09:58.972 --> 00:10:02.512
taken from the era in which
there was only chemotherapy,

00:10:02.536 --> 00:10:04.488
or surgery, or radiation available.

00:10:05.194 --> 00:10:07.567
But starting in 2004,

00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:10.217
when antiangiogenic therapies
first became available,

00:10:10.241 --> 00:10:15.151
you can see that there has been a 70
to 100 percent improvement in survival

00:10:15.175 --> 00:10:18.336
for people with kidney cancer,
multiple myeloma,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.582
colorectal cancer,
and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

00:10:22.439 --> 00:10:23.606
That's impressive.

00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:27.200
But for other tumors and cancer types,

00:10:27.224 --> 00:10:29.334
the improvements have only been modest.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.144
So I started asking myself,

00:10:32.168 --> 00:10:34.255
"Why haven't we been able to do better?"

00:10:35.421 --> 00:10:37.548
And the answer, to me, is obvious:

00:10:37.572 --> 00:10:39.874
we're treating cancer
too late in the game,

00:10:39.898 --> 00:10:41.557
when it's already established,

00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:44.236
and oftentimes, it's already
spread or metastasized.

00:10:44.732 --> 00:10:45.883
And as a doctor,

00:10:45.907 --> 00:10:49.749
I know that once a disease progresses
to an advanced stage,

00:10:49.773 --> 00:10:53.677
achieving a cure can be difficult,
if not impossible.

00:10:54.804 --> 00:11:00.688
So I went back to the biology
of angiogenesis, and started thinking:

00:11:00.712 --> 00:11:05.714
Could the answer to cancer
be preventing angiogenesis,

00:11:05.738 --> 00:11:07.603
beating cancer at its own game,

00:11:07.627 --> 00:11:10.260
so the cancers could never
become dangerous?

00:11:11.674 --> 00:11:13.356
This could help healthy people,

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.087
as well as people who've already
beaten cancer once or twice,

00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:19.853
and want to find a way
to keep it from coming back.

00:11:20.456 --> 00:11:23.236
So to look for a way to prevent
angiogenesis in cancer,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.236
I went back to look at cancer's causes.

00:11:25.832 --> 00:11:27.236
And what really intrigued me,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.593
was when I saw that diet
accounts for 30 to 35 percent

00:11:31.617 --> 00:11:33.535
of environmentally-caused cancers.

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:38.107
Now the obvious thing is to think about
what we could remove from our diet,

00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:39.789
what to strip out, take away.

00:11:40.702 --> 00:11:43.493
But I actually took
a completely opposite approach,

00:11:43.517 --> 00:11:46.906
and began asking: What could
we be adding to our diet

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.411
that's naturally antiangiogenic,

00:11:49.435 --> 00:11:51.768
and that could boost
the body's defense system,

00:11:51.792 --> 00:11:54.871
and beat back those blood vessels
that are feeding cancers?

00:11:54.895 --> 00:11:58.292
In other words, can we eat
to starve cancer?

00:11:58.316 --> 00:11:59.641
(Laughter)

00:11:59.665 --> 00:12:02.410
Well, the answer is yes,
and I'm going to show you how.

00:12:02.434 --> 00:12:05.798
And our search for this
has taken us to the market,

00:12:05.822 --> 00:12:07.671
the farm and to the spice cabinet,

00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:09.157
because what we've discovered

00:12:09.181 --> 00:12:11.451
is that Mother Nature
has laced a large number

00:12:11.475 --> 00:12:13.236
of foods and beverages and herbs

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.750
with naturally-occurring
inhibitors of angiogenesis.

00:12:17.638 --> 00:12:19.337
Here's a test system we developed.

00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:20.520
At the center is a ring

00:12:20.544 --> 00:12:24.154
from which hundreds of blood vessels
are growing out in a starburst fashion.

00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:27.097
And we can use this system
to test dietary factors

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:29.953
at concentrations
that are obtainable by eating.

00:12:30.969 --> 00:12:32.358
Let me show you what happens

00:12:32.382 --> 00:12:35.120
when we put in an extract from red grapes.

00:12:35.144 --> 00:12:37.236
The active ingredient is resveratrol,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.780
it's also found in red wine.

00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:42.236
This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.426
by 60 percent.

00:12:44.537 --> 00:12:47.704
Here's what happens when we added
an extract from strawberries.

00:12:47.728 --> 00:12:50.236
It potently inhibits angiogenesis.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.635
And extract from soybeans.

00:12:53.985 --> 00:12:55.906
And here is a growing list

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.953
of antiangiogenic foods and beverages
that we're interested in studying.

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:02.562
For each food type,

00:13:02.586 --> 00:13:04.808
we believe that there are
different potencies

00:13:04.832 --> 00:13:07.182
within different strains and varietals.

00:13:07.206 --> 00:13:09.437
And we want to measure this because,

00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:11.675
well, while you're eating a strawberry

00:13:11.699 --> 00:13:13.176
or drinking tea,

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.236
why not select the one that's most potent

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.559
for preventing cancer?

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.336
So here are four different teas
that we've tested.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.236
They're all common ones:
Chinese jasmine, Japanese sencha,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.880
Earl Grey and a special blend
that we prepared,

00:13:26.904 --> 00:13:30.605
and you can see clearly
that the teas vary in their potency,

00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:33.090
from less potent to more potent.

00:13:34.002 --> 00:13:35.486
But what's very cool

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:39.259
is when we combine
the two less potent teas together,

00:13:39.283 --> 00:13:43.576
the combination, the blend,
is more potent than either one alone.

00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:46.856
This means there's food synergy.

00:13:49.634 --> 00:13:51.523
Here's some more data from our testing.

00:13:51.547 --> 00:13:54.459
Now in the lab, we can
simulate tumor angiogenesis,

00:13:54.483 --> 00:13:56.474
represented here in a black bar.

00:13:56.498 --> 00:13:59.566
And using this system, we can test
the potency of cancer drugs.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.122
So the shorter the bar,

00:14:01.146 --> 00:14:03.201
the less angiogenesis -- that's good.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.099
And here are some common drugs

00:14:06.123 --> 00:14:10.236
that have been associated with reducing
the risk of cancer in people.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.061
Statins, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs,

00:14:13.085 --> 00:14:16.299
and a few others --
they inhibit angiogenesis, too.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.236
And here are the dietary factors

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.155
going head-to-head against these drugs.

00:14:22.179 --> 00:14:24.236
You can see they clearly hold their own,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.630
and in some cases, they're more potent
than the actual drugs.

00:14:28.011 --> 00:14:31.950
Soy, parsley, garlic, grapes, berries.

00:14:32.527 --> 00:14:35.733
I could go home and cook a tasty meal
using these ingredients.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.808
Imagine if we could create
the world's first rating system,

00:14:40.832 --> 00:14:42.379
in which we could score foods

00:14:42.403 --> 00:14:46.020
according to their antiangiogenic,
cancer-preventative properties.

00:14:46.567 --> 00:14:48.560
And that's what we're doing right now.

00:14:49.599 --> 00:14:51.525
Now, I've shown you a bunch of lab data,

00:14:51.549 --> 00:14:53.333
and so the real question is:

00:14:53.357 --> 00:14:55.635
What is the evidence in people

00:14:55.659 --> 00:14:59.516
that eating certain foods can reduce
angiogenesis in cancer?

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.236
Well, the best example I know

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.321
is a study of 79,000 men
followed over 20 years,

00:15:06.345 --> 00:15:09.186
in which it was found that men
who consumed cooked tomatoes

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.700
two to three times a week,

00:15:10.724 --> 00:15:13.236
had up to a 50 percent reduction

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.533
in their risk of developing
prostate cancer.

00:15:16.366 --> 00:15:19.672
Now, we know that tomatoes
are a good source of lycopene,

00:15:19.696 --> 00:15:22.236
and lycopene is antiangiogenic.

00:15:22.617 --> 00:15:24.935
But what's even more
interesting from this study,

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:27.516
is that in those men who did
develop prostate cancer,

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.334
those who ate more
servings of tomato sauce,

00:15:30.358 --> 00:15:33.462
actually had fewer blood vessels
feeding their cancer.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.678
So this human study is a prime example

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:41.628
of how antiangiogenic substances present
in food and consumed at practical levels,

00:15:41.652 --> 00:15:43.236
can have an impact on cancer.

00:15:43.936 --> 00:15:47.236
And we're now studying
the role of a healthy diet --

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.236
with Dean Ornish at UCSF
and Tufts University --

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.686
the role of this healthy diet
on markers of angiogenesis

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.613
that we can find in the bloodstream.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.682
Obviously, what I've shared with you
has some far-ranging implications,

00:15:59.706 --> 00:16:01.236
even beyond cancer research.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.512
Because if we're right,
it could impact consumer education,

00:16:04.536 --> 00:16:06.353
food services, public health

00:16:06.377 --> 00:16:08.236
and even the insurance industry.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.386
And in fact, some insurance companies

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.720
are already beginning
to think along these lines.

00:16:12.744 --> 00:16:15.618
Check out this ad from BlueCross
BlueShield of Minnesota.

00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:18.346
For many people around the world,

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.132
dietary cancer prevention
may be the only practical solution,

00:16:22.156 --> 00:16:25.605
because not everybody can afford
expensive end-stage cancer treatments,

00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:28.320
but everybody could benefit
from a healthy diet

00:16:28.344 --> 00:16:31.966
based on local, sustainable,
antiangiogenic crops.

00:16:33.505 --> 00:16:35.703
Now, finally,

00:16:35.727 --> 00:16:37.410
I've talked to you about food,

00:16:37.434 --> 00:16:39.236
and I've talked to you about cancer,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.560
so there's just one more disease
that I have to tell you about,

00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:44.236
and that's obesity.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.236
Because it turns out
that adipose tissue -- fat --

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.236
is highly angiogenesis-dependent.

00:16:50.886 --> 00:16:53.656
And like a tumor, fat grows
when blood vessels grow.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.898
So the question is:

00:16:54.922 --> 00:16:57.627
Can we shrink fat
by cutting off its blood supply?

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:03.235
The top curve shows the body weight
of a genetically obese mouse

00:17:03.259 --> 00:17:06.409
that eats nonstop until it turns fat,

00:17:06.433 --> 00:17:08.087
like this furry tennis ball.

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:09.297
(Laughter)

00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:12.512
And the bottom curve
is the weight of a normal mouse.

00:17:12.536 --> 00:17:13.838
If you take the obese mouse

00:17:13.862 --> 00:17:16.535
and give it an angiogenesis
inhibitor, it loses weight.

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:20.501
Stop the treatment, gains the weight back.
Restart the treatment, loses the weight.

00:17:20.525 --> 00:17:22.636
Stop the treatment,
it gains the weight back.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.017
And, in fact, you can cycle
the weight up and down

00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:27.033
simply by inhibiting angiogenesis.

00:17:27.057 --> 00:17:29.802
So this approach that we're taking
for cancer prevention

00:17:29.826 --> 00:17:32.144
may also have an application for obesity.

00:17:33.347 --> 00:17:35.451
The truly interesting thing about this

00:17:35.475 --> 00:17:37.451
is that we can't take these obese mice

00:17:37.475 --> 00:17:39.236
and make them lose more weight

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.029
than what the normal mouse's weight
is supposed to be.

00:17:42.481 --> 00:17:45.490
In other words,
we can't create supermodel mice.

00:17:45.514 --> 00:17:46.775
(Laughter)

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.843
And this speaks to the role
of angiogenesis

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:50.664
in regulating healthy set points.

00:17:51.764 --> 00:17:53.671
Albert Szent-Györgi once said,

00:17:53.695 --> 00:17:56.236
"Discovery consists of seeing
what everyone has seen,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.156
and thinking what no one has thought."

00:17:58.521 --> 00:17:59.951
I hope I've convinced you

00:17:59.975 --> 00:18:03.235
that for diseases like cancer,
obesity and other conditions,

00:18:03.259 --> 00:18:05.081
there may be a great power

00:18:05.105 --> 00:18:08.232
in attacking their common
denominator: angiogenesis.

00:18:08.256 --> 00:18:10.312
And that's what I think
the world needs now.

00:18:10.336 --> 00:18:11.487
Thank you.

00:18:11.511 --> 00:18:17.886
(Applause)

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.722
June Cohen: I have
a quick question for you.

00:18:23.746 --> 00:18:28.624
JC: So these drugs aren't exactly
in mainstream cancer treatments right now.

00:18:28.648 --> 00:18:32.236
For anyone out here who has cancer,
what would you recommend?

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.978
Do you recommend pursuing these
treatments now, for most cancer patients?

00:18:36.002 --> 00:18:38.210
William Li: There are
antiangiogenic treatments

00:18:38.234 --> 00:18:39.645
that are FDA approved,

00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:41.653
and if you're a cancer patient,

00:18:41.677 --> 00:18:45.588
or working for one or advocating for one,
you should ask about them.

00:18:45.612 --> 00:18:48.236
And there are many clinical trials.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.236
The Angiogenesis Foundation
is following almost 300 companies,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.661
and there are about 100 more
drugs in that pipeline.

00:18:55.685 --> 00:18:57.236
So, consider the approved ones,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.958
look for clinical trials,

00:18:58.982 --> 00:19:01.481
but then between
what the doctor can do for you,

00:19:01.505 --> 00:19:04.042
we need to start asking
what can we do for ourselves.

00:19:04.066 --> 00:19:06.146
This is one of the themes
I'm talking about:

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.325
We can empower ourselves

00:19:07.349 --> 00:19:09.536
to do the things that doctors
can't do for us,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.632
which is to use knowledge and take action.

00:19:11.656 --> 00:19:14.236
And if Mother Nature
has given us some clues,

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.512
we think there might be a new future
in the value of how we eat,

00:19:18.536 --> 00:19:21.634
and what we eat is really
our chemotherapy three times a day.

00:19:21.658 --> 00:19:23.707
JC: Right. And along those lines,

00:19:23.731 --> 00:19:26.236
for people who might have
risk factors for cancer,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.499
would you recommend pursuing
any treatments prophylactically,

00:19:29.523 --> 00:19:31.731
or simply pursuing the right diet,

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:33.236
with lots of tomato sauce?

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:36.737
WL: Well, you know, there's abundant
epidemiological evidence,

00:19:36.761 --> 00:19:38.452
and I think in the information age,

00:19:38.476 --> 00:19:41.315
it doesn't take long to go
to a credible source like PubMed,

00:19:41.339 --> 00:19:42.925
the National Library of Medicine,

00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:46.235
to look for epidemiological studies
for cancer risk reduction

00:19:46.259 --> 00:19:49.129
based on diet and based
on common medications.

00:19:49.153 --> 00:19:51.900
And that's certainly something
that anybody can look into.

00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:53.570
JC: Okay. Well, thank you so much.

00:19:53.594 --> 00:19:55.585
(Applause)
