00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I had requested slides,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
kind of adamantly, 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
up till the -- pretty much, last few days,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
but was denied access to a slide projector.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.330
(Laughter)

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
I actually find them a lot more emotional --

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
(Laughter)

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
-- and personal,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
and the neat thing about a slide projector

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
is you can actually focus the work,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
unlike PowerPoint and some other programs.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
Now, I agree that

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
you have to -- yeah, there are certain concessions

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
and, you know, if you use a slide projector,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
you're not able to have the bad type

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
swing in from the back or the side, or up or down,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
but maybe that's an O.K. trade-off,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
to trade that off for a focus.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
(Laughter)

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
It's a thought. Just a thought.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
And there's something nice about slides getting stuck.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
And the thing you really hope for

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
is occasionally they burn up,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
which we won't see tonight. So.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.330
With that, let's get the first slide up here.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
This, as many of you have probably guessed,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
is a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
recently emptied beer can in Portugal.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
(Laughter)

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
This -- I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
and I thought --

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
you know, fly all night, I looked up,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
and I thought, wow, how clean.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.330
You come into this major airport, and they simply have a B.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
I mean, how nice is that?

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
Everything's gotten simpler in design,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
and here's this mega airport,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
and God, I just -- I took a picture.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
I thought, God, that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
Till a couple months later,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
I went back to the same airport --

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
same plane, I think -- and looked up,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
and it said C.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.330
(Laughter)

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
It was only then that I realized

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
it was simply a gate that I was coming into.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
(Laughter)

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.330
I'm a big believer in the emotion of design,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
and the message that's sent

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
before somebody begins to read,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
before they get the rest of the information;

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
what is the emotional response they get to the product,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.330
to the story, to the painting -- whatever it is.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
That area of design interests me the most,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
and I think this for me is a real clear,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
very simplified version

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
of what I'm talking about.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
These are a couple of garage doors painted identical,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
situated next to each other.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.330
So, here's the first door. You know, you get the message.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
You know, it's pretty clear.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
Take a look at the second door and see

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
if there's any different message.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
O.K., which one would you park in front of?

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
(Laughter)

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
Same color, same message, same words.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
The only thing that's different

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.330
is the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece --

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
and, again,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
which is the psycho-killer here?

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.330
(Laughter)

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
Yet it doesn't say that; it doesn't need to say that.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
I would probably park in front of the other one.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
I'm sure a lot of you are aware

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
five years or so.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
come back the other way again and get a little more expressive.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
But I was in Milan and saw this street sign,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
and was very happy to

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
see that apparently this idea of minimalism

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.330
has even been translated by the graffiti artist.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
(Laughter)

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
And this graffiti artist has come along,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
(Laughter)

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
(Laughter)

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.330
This is for a book by "Metropolis."

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.330
I took some photos, and this is

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
a billboard in Florida,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
and either they hadn't paid their rent,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.330
and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down,

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
so they just teared out sections of it.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
And I would argue that it's possibly more effective

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
getting you to look over that way.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.330
And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things -- Stuckey's.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
This is from my second book.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
The first book is called, "The End of Print,"

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
and it was done along with a film,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
working with William Burroughs.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
And "The End of Print" is now in its fifth printing.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.330
(Laughter)

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.330
he said no; he said he didn't believe it was the end of print.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
And I said, well, that's fine;

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
I just would love to have your input on this film and this book,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
and he finally agreed to it.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.330
And at the end of the film, he says in this great voice

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
that I can't mimic but I'll kind of try, but not really, he says,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.330
"I remember attending an exhibition called,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.330
'Photography: The End of Painting.'"

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
And then he says, "And, of course, it wasn't at all."

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.330
So, apparently when photography was perfected,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
there were people going around saying,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
that's it: you've just ruined painting.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
People are just going to take pictures now.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
And of course, that wasn't the case.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.330
So, this is from "2nd Sight,"

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
a book I did on intuition.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
I think it's not the only ingredient in design,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
but possibly the most important.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.330
It's something everybody has.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
It's not a matter of teaching it;

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
as an ingredient of your working process

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
because they can't quantify it:

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.330
it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
or a newsletter.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
So it tends to get discounted.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.330
This is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.330
"The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
There comes a leap in consciousness --

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
call it intuition or what you will --

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.330
and the solution just comes to you, and you don't know from where or why."

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
So, it's kind of like when somebody says, Who did that song?

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.330
And the more you try to think about it,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
the further the answer gets from you,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
and the minute you stop thinking about it,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
your intuition gives you that answer, in a sense.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
I like this for a couple of reasons.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.330
If you've had any design courses, they would teach you you can't read this.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
I think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it's true.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.330
"Don't mistake legibility for communication."

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
Just because something's legible doesn't means it communicates.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.330
More importantly, it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
So, what is the message sent before

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.330
somebody actually gets into the material?

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.330
And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
This is working with Marshall McLuhan.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.330
I stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.330
and we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
predicting so much of what has happened

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.330
in the advertising, television, media world.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.330
And so this book is called "Probes." It's another word for quotes.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.330
And it's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.330
and basically, I've interpreted the different quotes.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.330
So, this was the contents page originally.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
When I got done it was 540 pages,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
and then the publisher, Gingko Press,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
ended up cutting it down considerably:

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
it's just under 400 pages now.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
But I decided I liked this contents page --

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
(Laughter)

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
but it's a nice spread, I think, in there.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
(Laughter)

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
So, a couple spreads from the book:

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
here McLuhan says,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.330
"The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature."

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
"The invention of printing did away with anonymity,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
fostering ideas of literary fame

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.330
and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property,"

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.330
which had never been done before printing.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
"When new technologies impose themselves

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.330
on societies long habituated to older technologies,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
anxieties of all kinds result."

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
"While people are engaged in creating a totally different world,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:00.330
they always form vivid images of the preceding world."

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
I hate this stuff. It's hard to read.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:13.330
(Laughter)

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.330
(Applause)

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:23.330
"People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.330
and no possible occupation except information gathering."

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.330
That was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.330
So, this is a project for Nine Inch Nails.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.330
And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
and it was done right after 9/11.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.330
And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.330
in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.330
that the real estate person hadn't pointed out.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.330
(Laughter)

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.330
There was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the '60s Cuban missile crisis.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
and he goes, "It's something to do with the sewage system."

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.330
I was, O.K.; that's fine.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.330
I finally went down there, and it was this old rusted circular thing,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.330
and two beds, and very kind of creepy and weird.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:19.330
and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
And I thought, you know, what were they thinking?

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
You'd think maybe cement, possibly, or something.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:28.330
But anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:34.330
and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:41.330
and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.330
This is an experiment, really, for a client, Quicksilver,

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
where we were taking what was a six-shot sequence

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.330
So, this is a six-shot sequence.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.330
I've taken one shot; I cropped it a few different ways.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
And then the tiny line of copy says,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
If you want to see this entire sequence --

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
how this whole ride was -- go to the website.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.330
And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.330
to get this entire picture.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.330
Got no way of tracking it, so I could be totally wrong.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.330
(Laughter)

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.330
I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke-free Environment --

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
asked me to do these posters.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
They were wild-posted around New York City.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
You can't really -- well, you can't see it at all --

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
but the second line is really the more kind of payoff, in a sense.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.330
It says, "If the cigarette companies can lie, then so can we." But --

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.330
(Laughter)

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.330
(Applause)

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
-- but I did.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.330
These were literally wild-posted all over New York one night,

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
and there were definitely some heads turning,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.330
you know, people smoking and, "Huh!"

00:11:54.330 --> 00:12:00.330
(Laughter)

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.330
And it was purposely done to look fairly serious.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
It wasn't some, you know, weird grunge type or something;

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.330
it looked like they might be real. Anyway.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.330
Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts, a school in Florida.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.330
This amazes me. This is a product I just found out.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
I was in the Caribbean at Christmas,

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.330
and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell --

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.330
not that they will sell --

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.330
that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
This was either an old product with new packaging,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
or a brand-new package, and I just thought,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
Yikes! How's that still happening?

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
I do a lot of workshops all over the world, really,

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
and this particular assignment was

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:57.330
(Laughter)

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.330
I felt this was one of the more successful solutions.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
The students actually cut them up

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
and put them up around bars and restaurants that night,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.330
and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ...

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.330
(Laughter)

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330
I did some work for Microsoft a few years back.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
It was a worldwide branding campaign.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
And it was interesting to me --

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
my background is in sociology; I had no design training,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
and sometimes people say, well, that explains it --

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.330
but it was a very interesting experiment

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
because there's no product that I had to sell;

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.330
it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
They thought some people didn't like them.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.330
(Laughter)

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
I found out that's very true,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.330
working on this campaign worldwide.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.330
And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit,

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.330
and what I did was add type and people to the ad,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
which the previous campaign had not had,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
and nobody remembered them, and nobody referenced them.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.330
And we were trying to say that,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.330
hey, some of these guys that work there are actually OK;

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
some of them actually have friends and family,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.330
and they're not all awful people.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.330
And the umbrella campaign was "Thank God it's Monday."

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
So, we tried to take this --

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.330
what was perceived as a negative:

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
their over-competitiveness, their,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
you know, long working hours --

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
and turn it into a positive and not run from it.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.330
You know: Thank God it's Monday --

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
I get to go back to that little cubicle, those fake gray walls,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
and hear everybody else's conversations f

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
or 10 hours and then go home.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.330
But anyway, this is one of the ads I was most pleased with,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
because they were all elaborately art-directed,

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.330
and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
It says, "Wonder Around." And then it's a piece of the software.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.330
And this is how the ad ran around the world.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.330
In Germany, they made one small change without checking with me --

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
nor did they have to, because it was done through agencies --

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.330
but see if you can tell the difference.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.330
This is how the ad ran throughout the world;

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.330
Germany made one slight change in the ad.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.330
(Laughter)

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.330
Now, there's kind of two issues here. 

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:07.330
If you're going to put a kid in the ad, pick one that looks alive.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:13.330
(Laughter)

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.330
I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.330
He's just really hoping that boots up and, you know ...

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:22.330
(Laughter)

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.330
And then as the agency explained to me, they said,

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.330
"Look, we don't have little green people in our country;

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.330
why would we put little green people in our ads, for instance?"

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:36.330
So, I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it;

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.330
I think it's a very small-minded approach,

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
the world is certainly much more global,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.330
and I certainly think the people of Germany

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.330
could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer,

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.330
though we'll never know.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.330
This is some work from Ray Gun.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.330
And the point of this magazine was to read the articles,

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.330
listen to the music, and try to interpret it.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.330
There's no grid, there's no system, there's nothing set up in advance.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.330
This is an opener for Brian Eno,

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.330
and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:08.330
This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.330
There's a lot of great writing in "Ray Gun."

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:15.330
And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.330
(Laughter)

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.330
Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article --

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.330
so I set the whole article in Dingbat.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:31.330
(Laughter)

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:35.330
You could -- you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something:

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.330
it is the actual article.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.330
I suppose you could eventually decode it,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.330
but it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.330
(Laughter)

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.330
Having done a lot of magazines,

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:50.330
I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories,

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.330
and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9/11.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.330
And I was basically pretty disappointed

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.330
to see that they had

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.330
chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times,

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.330
which was basically the moment of impact.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.330
And People magazine, I thought,

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.330
got probably the best shot.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:11.330
It's kind of horsey type, but the texture --

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.330
the second plane not quite hitting: 

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.330
there was something more enticing,

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.330
if that's the right -- it's not the right word --

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:20.330
but in this cover than Time or Newsweek.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.330
But when I got into this magazine,

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.330
there's something kind of disturbing, and this continued.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.330
On the left we see people dying; we see people running for their lives. 

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.330
And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.330
The coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.330
Look at the image of this lady --

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.330
who knows what she's going through? --

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.330
and the copy says: "He knows just how to give me goosebumps."

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.330
Yeah, he jumps out of buildings. It's --

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:50.330
unfortunately, this one works, kind of, as a spread.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.330
And this continued through the entire magazine.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.330
It did not let up.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.330
This says: "One clean fits all." .

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.330
There were a lot of orphans made this day,

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.330
and here's a dead body being brought out.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.330
It just seems to me possibly even a blank page

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.330
would have been more appropriate.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.330
And this one I think is possibly the worst:

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.330
two ladies, both facing the same way, both wearing jeans.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.330
One -- who knows what she's going through;

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.330
the other one is worried about model behavior and milk.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.330
And --

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.330
I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this,

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.330
and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that --

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.330
they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk,

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.330
and when they got back to their car,

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.330
they found a note on their car that made them think

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:41.330
maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event --

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.330
it had been a few months.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.330
This was what they found on their car.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:56.330
(Laughter)

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.330
There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car,

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.330
but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.330
This is my desktop.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.330
Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders,

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.330
but I don't know what they are.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.330
These are my notes for the talk -- there might be a correlation here.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.330
We are wrapping up. 

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.330
This I saw on the plane, flying in, for hot new products.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.330
I'm not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea,

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.330
because, like, if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer,

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.330
you can now get a plate in the keyboard,

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.330
so there's no more faking it --

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:41.330
that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.330
Now there's a plate, and it would be really, really convenient

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.330
to get a piece of pizza, then type a little bit, then ... 

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.330
I'm just not sure this is improvement.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.330
If you ever doubt the power of graphic design,

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:57.330
this is a very generic sign that literally says, "Vote for Hitler." It says nothing else.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.330
And this to me is an extreme case

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.330
of the power of emotion, of graphic design,

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:07.330
even though, in fact, was a very generic poster at the time.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.330
What's next? What's next is going to be people.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.330
As we get more technically driven,

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:15.330
the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.330
You have to utilize who you are in your work.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.330
Nobody else can do that: nobody else can pull from your background,

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.330
from your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.330
If you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work,

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.330
and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.330
This is -- I like found art; hand lettering's coming back in a big way,

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.330
and I thought this was a great example of both.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.330
This lady's advertising for her lost pit bull.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.330
It's friendly -- she's underlined friendly --

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.330
that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.330
(Laughter)

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.330
But more importantly,

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:53.330
she's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.330
And I'm thinking, yeah, right,

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.330
I'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.330
I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles,

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.330
and you get charged by this thing and you go,

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.330
oh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.330
(Laughter)

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.330
I'm sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.330
(Laughter)

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:19.330
But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.330
And the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.330
about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.330
And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father,

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.330
who was a test pilot, and he told me that

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.330
when you signed up to become a test pilot,

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.330
they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.330
of death on the job.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.330
That's pretty high for most occupations.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.330
(Laughter)

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.330
But, you know, the government would make a plane;

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.330
they'd say, go see if that one flies, would you?

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.330
Some of them did; some of them didn't.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.330
And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.330
between, like, serif versus san-serif.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.330
(Laughter)

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.330
And for the most part, they're not real life-threatening.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.330
Why not experiment? Why not have some fun?

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.330
Why not put some of yourself into the work?

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.330
And when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students,

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.330
What's the definition of a good job?

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.330
And as teachers, after you get all the answers,

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.330
you like to give them the correct answer.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.330
And the best one I've heard -- I'm sure some of you have heard this --

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.330
the definition of a good job is:

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.330
If you could afford to -- if money wasn't an issue --

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.330
would you be doing that same work?

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.330
And if you would, you've got a great job.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.330
And if you wouldn't, what the heck are you doing?

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.330
You're going to be dead a really long time.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.330
Thank you very much.
