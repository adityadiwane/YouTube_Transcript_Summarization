00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
What I'm going to try and do in the next 15 minutes or so

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
is tell you about an idea

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
of how we're going to make matter come alive.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Now this may seem a bit ambitious,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
but when you look at yourself, you look at your hands,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
you realize that you're alive.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
So this is a start.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
There's been four billion years

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
of organic, biological life.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And as an inorganic chemist,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
my friends and colleagues make this distinction

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
between the organic, living world

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and the inorganic, dead world.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And what I'm going to try and do is plant some ideas

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.260
about how we can transform inorganic, dead matter

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
into living matter, into inorganic biology.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Before we do that,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
I want to kind of put biology in its place.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And I'm absolutely enthralled by biology.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I love to do synthetic biology.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
I love things that are alive.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
But within that infrastructure,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
we have to remember

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
that the driving force of biology

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
is really coming from evolution.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
And evolution,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
although it was established well over 100 years ago by Charles Darwin

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and a vast number of other people,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
evolution still is a little bit intangible.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
And when I talk about Darwinian evolution,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
I mean one thing and one thing only,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and that is survival of the fittest.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
And so forget about evolution

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
in a kind of metaphysical way.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Think about evolution

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
in terms of offspring competing,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
and some winning.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So bearing that in mind,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
as a chemist, I wanted to ask myself

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
the question frustrated by biology:

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
What is the minimal unit of matter

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
that can undergo Darwinian evolution?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And this seems quite a profound question.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And as a chemist,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
we're not used to profound questions every day.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
So when I thought about it,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
then suddenly I realized

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
that biology gave us the answer.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And in fact, the smallest unit of matter

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
that can evolve independently

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
is, in fact, a single cell --

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
a bacteria.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
So this raises three really important questions:

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
What is life?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Is biology special?

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Biologists seem to think so.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Is matter evolvable?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Now if we answer those questions in reverse order,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
the third question -- is matter evolvable? --

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
if we can answer that,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
then we're going to know how special biology is,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and maybe, just maybe,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
we'll have some idea of what life really is.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
So here's some inorganic life.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
This is a dead crystal,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and I'm going to do something to it,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
and it's going to become alive.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And you can see,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
it's kind of pollinating, germinating, growing.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
This is an inorganic tube.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
And all these crystals here under the microscope

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
were dead a few minutes ago, and they look alive.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Of course, they're not alive.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
It's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
But when I saw this, I was really fascinated,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
because it seemed lifelike.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And as I pause for a few seconds, have a look at the screen.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
You can see there's architecture growing, filling the void.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And this is dead.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
So I was positive that,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
if somehow we can make things mimic life,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
let's go one step further.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Let's see if we can actually make life.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
But there's a problem,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
because up until maybe a decade ago,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
we were told that life was impossible

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
In fact, we were the only people

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
in the universe.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Now, that's a bit boring.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
So as a chemist,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
I wanted to say, "Hang on. What is going on here?

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Is life that improbable?"

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
And this is really the question.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
I think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
was as probable as the emergence of the stars.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And in fact, let's take that one step further.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Let's say

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
that if the physics of fusion

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
is encoded into the universe,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
maybe the physics of life is as well.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And so the problem with chemists --

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
and this is a massive advantage as well --

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
is we like to focus on our elements.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
In biology, carbon takes center stage.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And in a universe where carbon exists

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
and organic biology,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
then we have all this wonderful diversity of life.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.260
In fact, we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
We're awfully careful in the lab

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
to try and avoid various biohazards.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Well what about matter?

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
If we can make matter alive, would we have a matterhazard?

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
So think, this is a serious question.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
If your pen could replicate,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
that would be a bit of a problem.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
So we have to think differently

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
if we're going to make stuff come alive.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And we also have to be aware of the issues.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
But before we can make life,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
let's think for a second

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
what life really is characterized by.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And forgive the complicated diagram.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
This is just a collection of pathways in the cell.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And the cell is obviously for us

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
a fascinating thing.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Synthetic biologists are manipulating it.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And you have all these pathways going on at the same time.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
You have regulation;

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
information is transcribed;

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
catalysts are made; stuff is happening.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
But what does a cell do?

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Well it divides, it competes,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
it survives.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And I think that is where we have to start

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
in terms of thinking about

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
building from our ideas in life.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
But what else is life characterized by?

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Well, I like think of it

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
as a flame in a bottle.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And so what we have here

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
is a description of single cells

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
replicating, metabolizing,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
burning through chemistries.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And so we have to understand

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
we need to power it somehow.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
So before we can really start to make life,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
we have to really think about where it came from.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And Darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
that he thought that life probably emerged

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
in some warm little pond somewhere --

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
maybe not in Scotland, maybe in Africa,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
maybe somewhere else.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
But the real honest answer is, we just don't know,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
because there is a problem with the origin.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Imagine way back, four and a half billion years ago,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
there is a vast chemical soup of stuff.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And from this stuff we came.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
So when you think about the improbable nature

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
of what I'm going to tell you in the next few minutes,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
just remember,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
we came from stuff on planet Earth.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
And we went through a variety of worlds.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
The RNA people would talk about the RNA world.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
We somehow got to proteins and DNA.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
We then got to the last ancestor.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Evolution kicked in -- and that's the cool bit.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And here we are.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
But there's a roadblock that you can't get past.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
You can decode the genome, you can look back,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
you can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
but we can't get further than the last ancestor,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
the last visible cell

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
that we could sequence or think back in history.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
So we don't know how we got here.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
So there are two options:

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
intelligent design, direct and indirect --

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
so God,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
or my friend.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
Now talking about E.T. putting us there, or some other life,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
just pushes the problem further on.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
I'm not a politician, I'm a scientist.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
The other thing we need to think about

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
is the emergence of chemical complexity.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
This seems most likely.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
So we have some kind of primordial soup.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
And this one happens to be

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
a good source of all 20 amino acids.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
And somehow

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
these amino acids are combined,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
and life begins.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
But life begins, what does that mean?

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
What is life? What is this stuff of life?

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
So in the 1950s,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Miller-Urey did their fantastic chemical Frankenstein experiment,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
where they did the equivalent in the chemical world.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
They took the basic ingredients, put them in a single jar

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
and ignited them

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
and put a lot of voltage through.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
And they had a look at what was in the soup,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and they found amino acids,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
but nothing came out, there was no cell.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
So the whole area's been stuck for a while,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
and it got reignited in the '80s

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
In my own laboratory,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
the way we're trying to create inorganic life

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
is by using many different reaction formats.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
So what we're trying to do is do reactions --

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
not in one flask, but in tens of flasks,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
and connect them together,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
as you can see with this flow system, all these pipes.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
We can do it microfluidically, we can do it lithographically,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
we can do it in a 3D printer,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
we can do it in droplets for colleagues.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
And the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
just bubbling away.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.260
But that's probably going to end in failure,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
so we need to be a bit more focused.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
And the answer, of course, lies with mice.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
This is how I remember what I need as a chemist.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
I say, "Well I want molecules."

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
But I need a metabolism, I need some energy.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
I need some information, and I need a container.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Because if I want evolution,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
I need containers to compete.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
So if you have a container,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
it's like getting in your car.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
"This is my car,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
and I'm going to drive around and show off my car."

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
And I imagine you have a similar thing

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
in cellular biology

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
with the emergence of life.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
So these things together give us evolution, perhaps.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
And the way to test it in the laboratory

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
is to make it minimal.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
So what we're going to try and do

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
is come up with an inorganic Lego kit of molecules.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
And so forgive the molecules on the screen,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
but these are a very simple kit.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
There's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
And we can aggregate them together

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
and make literally thousands and thousands

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
of really big nano-molecular molecules

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
the same size of DNA and proteins,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
but there's no carbon in sight.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Carbon is banned.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And so with this Lego kit,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
we have the diversity required

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
for complex information storage

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
without DNA.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
But we need to make some containers.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
And just a few months ago in my lab,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
And you can see on the screen a cell being made.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
And we're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
And all I wanted to show you

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
is we can set up molecules

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
in membranes, in real cells,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.260
and then it sets up a kind of molecular Darwinism,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
a molecular survival of the fittest.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
And this movie here

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
shows this competition between molecules.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
Molecules are competing for stuff.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
They're all made of the same stuff,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
but they want their shape to win.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
They want their shape to persist.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
And that is the key.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
If we can somehow encourage these molecules

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
they will start to form cells

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
that will replicate and compete.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
If we manage to do that,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
forget the molecular detail.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
Let's zoom out to what that could mean.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
So we have this special theory of evolution

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
that applies only to organic biology, to us.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
If we could get evolution into the material world,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
then I propose we should have a general theory of evolution.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
And that's really worth thinking about.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
Does evolution control

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
the sophistication of matter in the universe?

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
Is there some driving force through evolution

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
that allows matter to compete?

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
So that means we could then start

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
to develop different platforms

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
for exploring this evolution.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
So you imagine,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
not only will this tell us about the origin of life --

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive;

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
it can use anything --

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
because we can then use software control

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
for evolution to code in.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
So imagine we make a little cell.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
We want to put it out in the environment,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
and we want it to be powered by the Sun.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
And we don't use design anymore. We find what works.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
We should take our inspiration from biology.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
Biology doesn't care about the design

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
unless it works.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
So this will reorganize

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
the way we design things.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
But not only just that,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
we will start to think about

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Wouldn't it be great

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
if you could take these artificial biological cells

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
and fuse them with biological ones

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
to correct problems that we couldn't really deal with?

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
The real issue in cellular biology

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
is we are never going to understand everything,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
because it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Evolution cannot be cut apart.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
You need to somehow find the fitness function.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
And the profound realization for me

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
is that, if this works,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
and we really start talking about selfish matter.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
And what does that mean in a universe

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
where we are right now the highest form of stuff?

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
You're sitting on chairs.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
They're inanimate, they're not alive.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
But you are made of stuff, and you are using stuff,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
and you enslave stuff.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
So using evolution

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
in biology,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
and in inorganic biology,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
for me is quite appealing, quite exciting.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
And we're really becoming very close

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
to understanding the key steps

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
that makes dead stuff come alive.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
And again, when you're thinking about how improbable this is,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
remember, five billion years ago,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
we were not here, and there was no life.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
So what will that tell us

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
about the origin of life and the meaning of life?

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
But perhaps, for me as a chemist,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
I want to keep away from general terms;

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
I want to think about specifics.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
So what does it mean about defining life?

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
We really struggle to do this.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
And I think, if we can make inorganic biology,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
and we can make matter become evolvable,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
that will in fact define life.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
I propose to you

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
that matter that can evolve is alive,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
and this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
Thank you very much.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:07.260
(Applause)

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.260
Chris Anderson: Just a quick question on timeline.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
You believe you're going to be successful in this project?

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
When?

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
Lee Cronin: So many people think

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
that life took millions of years to kick in.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
We're proposing to do it in just a few hours,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
once we've set up

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
the right chemistry.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
CA: And when do you think that will happen?

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
LC: Hopefully within the next two years.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
CA: That would be a big story.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
(Laughter)

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
In your own mind, what do you believe the chances are

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
that walking around on some other planet

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
is non-carbon-based life,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
walking or oozing or something?

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
LC: I think it's 100 percent.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
Because the thing is, we are so chauvinistic to biology,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
if you take away carbon, there's other things that can happen.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
So the other thing

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
that if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
Don't go and look for carbon, go and look for evolvable stuff.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
CA: Lee Cronin, good luck. (LC: Thank you very much.)

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
(Applause)
