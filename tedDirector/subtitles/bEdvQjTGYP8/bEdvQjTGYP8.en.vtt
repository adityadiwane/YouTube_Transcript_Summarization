00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.142
So, there's an actor
called Dustin Hoffman.

00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:19.619
And years ago, he made this movie
which some of you may have heard of,

00:00:19.643 --> 00:00:20.833
called "The Graduate."

00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:23.874
And there's two key scenes in that movie.

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:26.653
The first one is the seduction scene.

00:00:26.677 --> 00:00:28.670
I'm not going to talk about that tonight.

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:30.161
(Laughter)

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:34.775
The second scene is where he's taken out
by the old guy to the pool,

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:39.818
and as a young college graduate,
the old guy basically says one word,

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:41.031
just one word.

00:00:41.835 --> 00:00:44.127
And of course, all of you know
what that word is.

00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:45.341
It's "plastics."

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:46.531
(Laughter)

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.122
And the only problem with that is,
it was completely the wrong advice.

00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:52.633
(Laughter)

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.377
Let me tell you why it was so wrong.

00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:57.194
The word should have been "silicon."

00:00:58.163 --> 00:01:00.187
And the reason it should have been silicon

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:05.392
is because the basic patents
for semiconductors had already been made,

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:06.793
had already been filed,

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:08.582
and they were already building them.

00:01:08.606 --> 00:01:11.693
So Silicon Valley was just
being built in 1967,

00:01:11.717 --> 00:01:13.525
when this movie was released.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.637
And the year after the movie was released,

00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:16.826
Intel was founded.

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:20.153
So had the graduate heard
the right one word,

00:01:20.177 --> 00:01:23.709
maybe he would have ended up
onstage -- oh, I don't know --

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:24.891
maybe with these two.

00:01:24.915 --> 00:01:27.794
(Laughter)

00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:33.666
So as you're thinking of that,

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:38.064
let's see what bit of advice
we might want to give

00:01:38.088 --> 00:01:41.678
so that your next graduate doesn't become
a Tupperware salesman.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.582
(Laughter)

00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:47.351
So in 2015, what word of advice
would you give people,

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:50.016
when you took a college
graduate out by the pool

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.930
and you said one word, just one word?

00:01:52.698 --> 00:01:54.698
I think the answer would be "lifecode."

00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:56.471
So what is "lifecode?"

00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:59.232
Lifecode is the various ways
we have of programming life.

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:01.091
So instead of programming computers,

00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:03.788
we're using things to program viruses

00:02:03.812 --> 00:02:05.836
or retroviruses or proteins

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.668
or DNA or RNA

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:11.144
or plants or animals,
or a whole series of creatures.

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:14.162
And as you're thinking
about this incredible ability

00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:16.439
to make life do what you want it to do,

00:02:16.463 --> 00:02:18.580
what it's programmed to do,

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:20.397
what you end up doing

00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:23.866
is taking what we've been doing
for thousands of years,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.011
which is breeding, changing,

00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:29.106
mixing, matching

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.139
all kinds of life-forms,

00:02:31.163 --> 00:02:32.624
and we accelerate it.

00:02:32.648 --> 00:02:34.148
And this is not something new.

00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:36.472
This humble mustard weed has been modified

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.168
so that if you change it in one way,
you get broccoli.

00:02:40.714 --> 00:02:43.240
And if you change it
in a second way, you get kale.

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:45.780
And if you change it in a third way,

00:02:45.804 --> 00:02:47.073
you get cauliflower.

00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:51.014
So when you go to these
all-natural, organic markets,

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:52.618
you're really going to a place

00:02:52.642 --> 00:02:56.601
where people have been changing
the lifecode of plants for a long time.

00:02:57.464 --> 00:02:58.628
The difference today,

00:02:58.652 --> 00:03:00.897
to pick a completely
politically neutral term --

00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:02.612
[Intelligent design]

00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:03.793
(Laughter)

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:06.223
We're beginning to practice
intelligent design.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.057
That means that instead
of doing this at random

00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:11.137
and seeing what happens over generations,

00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:14.847
we're inserting specific genes,
we're inserting specific proteins,

00:03:14.871 --> 00:03:18.078
and we're changing lifecode
for very deliberate purposes.

00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:21.839
And that allows us to accelerate
how this stuff happens.

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:24.211
Let me just give you one example.

00:03:26.928 --> 00:03:29.823
Some of you occasionally
might think about sex.

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.528
And we kind of take it for granted
how we've changed sex.

00:03:34.552 --> 00:03:37.460
So we think it's perfectly normal
and natural to change it.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.299
What's happened with sex over time is --

00:03:40.323 --> 00:03:43.011
normally, sex equals baby, eventually.

00:03:43.971 --> 00:03:45.481
But in today's world,

00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:48.384
sex plus pill equals no baby.

00:03:48.408 --> 00:03:49.892
(Laughter)

00:03:49.916 --> 00:03:52.654
And again, we think
that's perfectly normal and natural,

00:03:52.678 --> 00:03:55.528
but that has not been the case
for most of human history.

00:03:55.552 --> 00:03:57.203
And it's not the case for animals.

00:03:57.608 --> 00:03:59.590
What it is does is it gives us control,

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:02.053
so sex becomes separate from conception.

00:04:02.955 --> 00:04:05.400
And as you're thinking
of the consequences of that,

00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:07.088
then we've been playing with stuff

00:04:07.112 --> 00:04:09.423
that's a little bit more
advanced, like art.

00:04:09.447 --> 00:04:11.525
Not in the sense
of painting and sculpture,

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.226
but in the sense of assisted
reproductive technologies.

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:19.841
So what are assisted
reproductive technologies?

00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:23.583
Assisted reproductive technologies
are things like in vitro fertilization.

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.838
And when you do in vitro fertilization,
there's very good reasons to do it.

00:04:27.862 --> 00:04:30.982
Sometimes you just
can't conceive otherwise.

00:04:31.622 --> 00:04:32.777
But when you do that,

00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:36.863
what youâ€™re doing is separating
sex, conception, baby.

00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:40.690
So you haven't just taken control
of when you have a baby,

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:44.038
you've separated when the baby
and where the baby is fertilized.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.922
So you've separated the baby

00:04:46.946 --> 00:04:48.651
from the body from the act.

00:04:49.332 --> 00:04:52.412
And as you're thinking
of other things we've been doing,

00:04:52.436 --> 00:04:54.294
think about twins.

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:57.149
So you can freeze sperm,
you can freeze eggs,

00:04:57.173 --> 00:04:58.870
you can freeze fertilized eggs.

00:04:59.778 --> 00:05:01.543
And what does that mean?

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:04.061
Well, that's a good thing
if you're a cancer patient.

00:05:04.085 --> 00:05:07.089
You're about to go under chemotherapy
or under radiation,

00:05:07.113 --> 00:05:08.343
so you save these things.

00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:09.604
You don't irradiate them.

00:05:10.072 --> 00:05:12.398
But if you can save them
and you can freeze them,

00:05:12.422 --> 00:05:14.524
and you can have a surrogate mother,

00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:16.707
it means that you've
decoupled sex from time.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.628
It means you can have twins
born -- oh, in 50 years?

00:05:23.287 --> 00:05:26.976
(Laughter)

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.257
In a hundred years?

00:05:29.342 --> 00:05:30.630
Two hundred years?

00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:34.353
And these are three
really profound changes

00:05:34.377 --> 00:05:35.976
that are not, like, future stuff.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.117
This is stuff we take for granted today.

00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:41.840
So this lifecode stuff
turns out to be a superpower.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.856
It turns out to be this incredibly
powerful way of changing viruses,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.064
of changing plants, of changing animals,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.094
perhaps even of evolving ourselves.

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:55.860
It's something that Steve Gullans and I
have been thinking about for a while.

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:57.908
Let's have some risks.

00:05:58.408 --> 00:06:02.552
Like every powerful technology,
like electricity, like an automobile,

00:06:02.576 --> 00:06:05.885
like computers, this stuff
potentially can be misused.

00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:08.202
And that scares a lot of people.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.785
And as you apply these technologies,

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:13.061
you can even turn human
beings into chimeras.

00:06:13.815 --> 00:06:16.354
Remember the Greek myth
where you mix animals?

00:06:16.378 --> 00:06:18.036
Well, some of these treatments

00:06:18.388 --> 00:06:20.634
actually end up changing your blood type.

00:06:21.406 --> 00:06:25.585
Or they'll put male cells
in a female body or vice versa,

00:06:26.326 --> 00:06:27.914
which sounds absolutely horrible

00:06:27.938 --> 00:06:30.215
until you realize, the reason
you're doing that

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:33.644
is you're substituting bone marrow
during cancer treatments.

00:06:33.668 --> 00:06:35.916
So by taking somebody else's bone marrow,

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.632
you may be changing
some fundamental aspects of yourself,

00:06:38.656 --> 00:06:40.544
but you're also saving your life.

00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:42.714
And as you're thinking about this stuff,

00:06:42.738 --> 00:06:44.908
here's something
that happened 20 years ago.

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:46.862
This is Emma Ott.

00:06:46.886 --> 00:06:49.695
She's a recent college admittee.

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.624
She's studying accounting.

00:06:51.648 --> 00:06:55.012
She played two varsity sports.
She graduated as a valedictorian.

00:06:55.687 --> 00:06:57.707
And that's not particularly extraordinary,

00:06:57.731 --> 00:07:01.302
except that she's the first human being
born to three parents.

00:07:02.244 --> 00:07:03.395
Why?

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.585
Because she had a deadly
mitochondrial disease

00:07:05.609 --> 00:07:07.094
that she might have inherited.

00:07:07.118 --> 00:07:09.499
So when you swap out a third person's DNA

00:07:09.523 --> 00:07:11.251
and you put it in there,

00:07:11.275 --> 00:07:12.832
you save the lives of people.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.221
But you also are doing
germline engineering,

00:07:16.245 --> 00:07:20.388
which means her kids,
if she has kids, will be saved

00:07:20.412 --> 00:07:21.822
and won't go through this.

00:07:21.846 --> 00:07:23.337
And [their] kids will be saved,

00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:25.196
and their grandchildren will be saved,

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.417
and this passes on.

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:28.554
That makes people nervous.

00:07:28.578 --> 00:07:30.928
So 20 years ago,
the various authorities said,

00:07:30.952 --> 00:07:32.871
why don't we study this for a while?

00:07:33.903 --> 00:07:37.717
There are risks to doing stuff,
and there are risks to not doing stuff,

00:07:37.741 --> 00:07:41.089
because there were a couple dozen people
saved by this technology,

00:07:41.113 --> 00:07:44.097
and then we've been thinking about it
for the next 20 years.

00:07:45.002 --> 00:07:46.185
So as we think about it,

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:50.019
as we take the time to say, "Hey,
maybe we should have longer studies,

00:07:50.043 --> 00:07:52.444
maybe we should do this,
maybe we should do that,"

00:07:52.468 --> 00:07:56.277
there are consequences to acting,
and there are consequences to not acting.

00:07:57.203 --> 00:07:58.896
Like curing deadly diseases --

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:01.926
which, by the way,
is completely unnatural.

00:08:02.997 --> 00:08:06.079
It is normal and natural
for humans to be felled

00:08:06.103 --> 00:08:10.172
by massive epidemics of polio,
of smallpox, of tuberculosis.

00:08:10.196 --> 00:08:13.839
When we put vaccines into people,
we are putting unnatural things

00:08:13.863 --> 00:08:15.229
into their body

00:08:15.253 --> 00:08:19.362
because we think the benefit
outweighs the risk.

00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:23.842
Because we've built unnatural plants,
unnatural animals,

00:08:23.866 --> 00:08:26.039
we can feed about seven billion people.

00:08:26.413 --> 00:08:29.585
We can do things
like create new life-forms.

00:08:30.302 --> 00:08:33.819
And as you create new life-forms,
again, that sounds terribly scary

00:08:33.843 --> 00:08:35.524
and terribly bothersome,

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:38.992
until you realize that those life-forms
live on your dining room table.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.036
Those flowers you've got
on your dining room table --

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.229
there's not a lot
that's natural about them,

00:08:44.253 --> 00:08:47.345
because people have been breeding
the flowers to make this color,

00:08:47.369 --> 00:08:49.129
to be this size, to last for a week.

00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:51.542
You don't usually give
your loved one wildflowers

00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:54.533
because they don't last
a whole lot of time.

00:08:56.532 --> 00:08:57.770
What all this does

00:08:58.421 --> 00:09:00.596
is it flips Darwin completely on his head.

00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:02.900
See, for four billion years,

00:09:02.924 --> 00:09:05.989
what lived and died on this planet
depended on two principles:

00:09:06.608 --> 00:09:09.132
on natural selection and random mutation.

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:12.643
And so what lived and died,
what was structured,

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:14.850
has now been flipped on its head.

00:09:16.262 --> 00:09:17.461
And what we've done

00:09:17.485 --> 00:09:20.096
is created this completely
parallel evolutionary system

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.449
where we are practicing unnatural
selection and non-random mutation.

00:09:23.473 --> 00:09:25.168
So let me explain these things.

00:09:25.192 --> 00:09:26.581
This is natural selection.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.495
This is unnatural selection.

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:31.141
(Laughter)

00:09:31.903 --> 00:09:34.547
So what happens with this stuff is,

00:09:34.571 --> 00:09:37.285
we started breeding wolves
thousands of years ago

00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:39.499
in central Asia to turn them into dogs.

00:09:39.523 --> 00:09:41.817
And then we started
turning them into big dogs

00:09:41.841 --> 00:09:43.592
and into little dogs.

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:45.403
But if you take one of the chihuahuas

00:09:45.427 --> 00:09:48.275
you see in the HermÃ¨s bags on Fifth Avenue

00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:50.956
and you let it loose on the African plain,

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.964
you can watch natural selection happen.

00:09:52.988 --> 00:09:55.669
(Laughter)

00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:01.236
Few things on Earth
are less natural than a cornfield.

00:10:02.188 --> 00:10:05.761
You will never, under any scenario,
walk through a virgin forest

00:10:05.785 --> 00:10:08.470
and see the same plant
growing in orderly rows

00:10:08.494 --> 00:10:09.818
at the same time,

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.453
nothing else living there.

00:10:12.398 --> 00:10:13.557
When you do a cornfield,

00:10:13.581 --> 00:10:15.628
you're selecting what lives and what dies.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.419
And you're doing that
through unnatural selection.

00:10:18.443 --> 00:10:21.580
It's the same with a wheat field,
it's the same with a rice field.

00:10:21.604 --> 00:10:24.219
It's the same with a city,
it's the same with a suburb.

00:10:24.243 --> 00:10:26.138
In fact, half the surface of Earth

00:10:26.162 --> 00:10:27.669
has been unnaturally engineered

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:30.876
so that what lives and what dies
there is what we want,

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.363
which is the reason why
you don't have grizzly bears

00:10:33.387 --> 00:10:35.314
walking through downtown Manhattan.

00:10:37.077 --> 00:10:38.936
How about this random mutation stuff?

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.403
Well, this is random mutation.

00:10:40.427 --> 00:10:41.767
This is Antonio Alfonseca.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.061
He's otherwise known
as the Octopus, his nickname.

00:10:45.085 --> 00:10:47.359
He was the Relief Pitcher
of the Year in 2000.

00:10:47.955 --> 00:10:50.719
And he had a random mutation
that gave him six fingers

00:10:50.743 --> 00:10:52.971
on each hand,

00:10:52.995 --> 00:10:55.637
which turns out to be really useful
if you're a pitcher.

00:10:55.661 --> 00:10:57.301
(Laughter)

00:10:58.119 --> 00:10:59.849
How about non-random mutation?

00:11:00.415 --> 00:11:03.388
A non-random mutation is beer.

00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:05.110
It's wine. It's yogurt.

00:11:05.928 --> 00:11:08.264
How many times have you walked
through the forest

00:11:08.288 --> 00:11:09.851
and found all-natural cheese?

00:11:10.859 --> 00:11:12.102
Or all-natural yogurt?

00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:14.831
So we've been engineering this stuff.

00:11:14.855 --> 00:11:16.323
Now, the interesting thing is,

00:11:16.347 --> 00:11:17.965
we get to know the stuff better.

00:11:18.364 --> 00:11:22.077
We found one of the single most powerful
gene-editing instruments,

00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:23.888
CRISPR, inside yogurt.

00:11:25.028 --> 00:11:27.018
And as we start engineering cells,

00:11:27.042 --> 00:11:31.322
we're producing eight out of the top 10
pharmaceutical products,

00:11:32.246 --> 00:11:34.771
including the stuff that you use
to treat arthritis,

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:37.221
which is the number one
best-selling drug, Humira.

00:11:37.985 --> 00:11:39.436
So this lifecode stuff.

00:11:40.229 --> 00:11:41.605
It really is a superpower.

00:11:42.156 --> 00:11:44.070
It really is a way of programming stuff,

00:11:44.094 --> 00:11:46.651
and there's nothing
that's going to change us

00:11:46.675 --> 00:11:48.801
more than this lifecode.

00:11:49.597 --> 00:11:51.578
So as you're thinking of lifecode,

00:11:51.602 --> 00:11:53.291
let's think of five principles

00:11:54.231 --> 00:11:56.086
as to how we start guiding,

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.729
and I'd love you to give me more.

00:11:58.315 --> 00:11:59.817
So, principle number one:

00:12:00.282 --> 00:12:02.425
we have to take responsibility
for this stuff.

00:12:03.042 --> 00:12:05.593
The reason we have to take responsibility

00:12:05.617 --> 00:12:06.978
is because we're in charge.

00:12:07.002 --> 00:12:08.915
These aren't random mutations.

00:12:08.939 --> 00:12:11.242
This is what we are doing,
what we are choosing.

00:12:11.266 --> 00:12:12.965
It's not, "Stuff happened."

00:12:12.989 --> 00:12:14.462
It didn't happen at random.

00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:17.090
It didn't come down
by a verdict of somebody else.

00:12:17.114 --> 00:12:18.931
We engineer this stuff,

00:12:18.955 --> 00:12:22.200
and it's the Pottery Barn rule:
you break it, you own it.

00:12:22.962 --> 00:12:24.491
Principle number two:

00:12:24.515 --> 00:12:27.643
we have to recognize and celebrate
diversity in this stuff.

00:12:27.667 --> 00:12:30.801
There have been at least
33 versions of hominids

00:12:30.825 --> 00:12:32.547
that have walked around this Earth.

00:12:32.912 --> 00:12:35.218
Most all of them went extinct except us.

00:12:35.804 --> 00:12:37.965
But the normal and natural
state of this Earth

00:12:37.989 --> 00:12:41.376
is we have various versions of humans
walking around at the same time,

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.057
which is why most of us
have some Neanderthal in us.

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:46.999
Some of us have some Denisova in us.

00:12:47.023 --> 00:12:49.372
And some in Washington
have a lot more of it.

00:12:49.396 --> 00:12:51.974
(Laughter)

00:12:51.998 --> 00:12:53.883
Principle number three:

00:12:53.907 --> 00:12:56.072
we have to respect other people's choices.

00:12:56.608 --> 00:12:58.883
Some people will choose to never alter.

00:12:58.907 --> 00:13:00.717
Some people will choose to alter all.

00:13:00.741 --> 00:13:03.367
Some people will choose
to alter plants but not animals.

00:13:03.391 --> 00:13:05.442
Some people will choose
to alter themselves.

00:13:05.466 --> 00:13:07.729
Some people will choose
to evolve themselves.

00:13:07.753 --> 00:13:09.322
Diversity is not a bad thing,

00:13:09.346 --> 00:13:11.988
because even though we think
of humans as very diverse,

00:13:12.012 --> 00:13:14.297
we came so close to extinction

00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:16.936
that all of us descend
from a single African mother

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.285
and the consequence of that

00:13:18.309 --> 00:13:22.814
is there's more genetic diversity
in 55 African chimpanzees

00:13:22.838 --> 00:13:24.713
than there are in seven billion humans.

00:13:26.254 --> 00:13:28.256
Principle number four:

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:31.079
we should take about
a quarter of the Earth

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.060
and only let Darwin run the show there.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.582
It doesn't have to be contiguous,

00:13:36.606 --> 00:13:38.380
doesn't have to all be tied together.

00:13:38.404 --> 00:13:40.610
It should be part
in the oceans, part on land.

00:13:40.634 --> 00:13:44.017
But we should not run every
evolutionary decision on this planet.

00:13:44.474 --> 00:13:46.912
We want to have
our evolutionary system running.

00:13:46.936 --> 00:13:49.513
We want to have Darwin's
evolutionary system running.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:53.213
And it's just really important to have
these two things running in parallel

00:13:53.237 --> 00:13:54.754
and not overwhelm evolution.

00:13:54.778 --> 00:13:58.888
(Applause)

00:14:02.307 --> 00:14:03.701
Last thing I'll say.

00:14:04.654 --> 00:14:07.916
This is the single most exciting
adventure human beings have been on.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.981
This is the single greatest superpower
humans have ever had.

00:14:11.005 --> 00:14:13.873
It would be a crime for you
not to participate in this stuff

00:14:13.897 --> 00:14:15.309
because you're scared of it,

00:14:15.333 --> 00:14:17.072
because you're hiding from it.

00:14:17.096 --> 00:14:20.467
You can participate in the ethics.
You can participate in the politics.

00:14:20.491 --> 00:14:22.240
You can participate in the business.

00:14:22.264 --> 00:14:25.422
You can participate in just thinking
about where medicine is going,

00:14:25.446 --> 00:14:26.607
where industry is going,

00:14:26.631 --> 00:14:28.434
where we're going to take the world.

00:14:28.458 --> 00:14:30.323
It would be a crime for all of us

00:14:30.347 --> 00:14:34.405
not to be aware when somebody
shows up at a swimming pool

00:14:34.429 --> 00:14:37.008
and says one word, just one word,

00:14:37.499 --> 00:14:39.898
if you don't listen
if that word is "lifecode."

00:14:39.922 --> 00:14:41.200
Thank you very much.

00:14:41.224 --> 00:14:48.437
(Applause)
