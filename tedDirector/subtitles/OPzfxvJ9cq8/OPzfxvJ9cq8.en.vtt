00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.256
Imagine being unable to say,
"I am hungry," "I am in pain,"

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.816
"thank you," or "I love you."

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.936
Being trapped inside your body,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.096
a body that doesn't respond to commands.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.776
Surrounded by people,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.416
yet utterly alone.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.136
Wishing you could reach out,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.376
to connect, to comfort, to participate.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.480
For 13 long years, that was my reality.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.056
Most of us never think twice
about talking, about communicating.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.216
I've thought a lot about it.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.896
I've had a lot of time to think.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.016
For the first 12 years of my life,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.736
I was a normal, happy, healthy little boy.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.896
Then everything changed.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.176
I contracted a brain infection.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.496
The doctors weren't sure what it was,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.016
but they treated me the best they could.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.416
However, I progressively got worse.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.616
Eventually, I lost my ability
to control my movements,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.976
make eye contact,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.239
and finally, my ability to speak.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.496
While in hospital,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.096
I desperately wanted to go home.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.416
I said to my mother, "When home?"

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.896
Those were the last words
I ever spoke with my own voice.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.736
I would eventually fail every test
for mental awareness.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.576
My parents were told
I was as good as not there.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.216
A vegetable, having the intelligence
of a three-month-old baby.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.896
They were told to take me home
and try to keep me comfortable

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.120
until I died.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.536
My parents, in fact
my entire family's lives,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.856
became consumed by taking care of me
the best they knew how.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.216
Their friends drifted away.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.056
One year turned to two,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.400
two turned to three.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.656
It seemed like the person I once was
began to disappear.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.576
The Lego blocks and electronic circuits
I'd loved as a boy were put away.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.056
I had been moved out of my bedroom
into another more practical one.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.776
I had become a ghost,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.175
a faded memory of a boy
people once knew and loved.

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:24.456
Meanwhile, my mind began
knitting itself back together.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.496
Gradually, my awareness started to return.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.856
But no one realized
that I had come back to life.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.696
I was aware of everything,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.736
just like any normal person.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.056
I could see and understand everything,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.920
but I couldn't find a way
to let anybody know.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.536
My personality was entombed
within a seemingly silent body,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.280
a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight
within a chrysalis.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.656
The stark reality hit me
that I was going to spend

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.336
the rest of my life locked inside myself,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.056
totally alone.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.696
I was trapped with only
my thoughts for company.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.896
I would never be rescued.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.856
No one would ever show me tenderness.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.136
I would never talk to a friend.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.080
No one would ever love me.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.056
I had no dreams, no hope,
nothing to look forward to.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.576
Well, nothing pleasant.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.936
I lived in fear,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.496
and, to put it bluntly,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.576
was waiting for death
to finally release me,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.496
expecting to die all alone in a care home.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.896
I don't know if it's truly possible
to express in words

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.736
what it's like not to be able
to communicate.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.176
Your personality appears
to vanish into a heavy fog

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.976
and all of your emotions and desires are
constricted, stifled and muted within you.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.496
For me, the worst was the feeling
of utter powerlessness.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.960
I simply existed.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.136
It's a very dark place to find yourself

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.840
because in a sense, you have vanished.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.216
Other people controlled
every aspect of my life.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.536
They decided what I ate and when.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.536
Whether I was laid on my side
or strapped into my wheelchair.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.936
I often spent my days
positioned in front of the TV

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.800
watching Barney reruns.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.336
I think because Barney
is so happy and jolly,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.096
and I absolutely wasn't,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.800
it made it so much worse.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.216
I was completely powerless
to change anything in my life

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.696
or people's perceptions of me.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.296
I was a silent, invisible observer
of how people behaved

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.696
when they thought no one was watching.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.416
Unfortunately, I wasn't only an observer.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.416
With no way to communicate,
I became the perfect victim:

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.416
a defenseless object,
seemingly devoid of feelings

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.176
that people used
to play out their darkest desires.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.856
For more than 10 years,
people who were charged with my care

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.040
abused me physically,
verbally and sexually.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.520
Despite what they thought, I did feel.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.136
The first time it happened,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.816
I was shocked and filled with disbelief.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.360
How could they do this to me?

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.696
I was confused.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.840
What had I done to deserve this?

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.496
Part of me wanted to cry
and another part wanted to fight.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.256
Hurt, sadness and anger
flooded through me.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.056
I felt worthless.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.000
There was no one to comfort me.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.336
But neither of my parents
knew this was happening.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.416
I lived in terror, knowing
it would happen again and again.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.536
I just never knew when.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.320
All I knew was that I would
never be the same.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.976
I remember once listening
to Whitney Houston singing,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.856
"No matter what they take from me,
they can't take away my dignity."

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.800
And I thought to myself,
"You want to bet?"

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.856
Perhaps my parents could have
found out and could have helped.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.136
But the years of constant caretaking,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.056
having to wake up
every two hours to turn me,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.456
combined with them essentially
grieving the loss of their son,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.816
had taken a toll on my mother and father.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.416
Following yet another heated argument
between my parents,

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.056
in a moment of despair and desperation,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.400
my mother turned to me
and told me that I should die.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.296
I was shocked, but as I thought
about what she had said,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.336
I was filled with enormous compassion
and love for my mother,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.320
yet I could do nothing about it.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.016
There were many moments when I gave up,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.416
sinking into a dark abyss.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.576
I remember one particularly low moment.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.856
My dad left me alone in the car

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.456
while he quickly went
to buy something from the store.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.096
A random stranger walked past,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.960
looked at me and he smiled.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.016
I may never know why, but that simple act,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.336
the fleeting moment of human connection,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.736
transformed how I was feeling,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.680
making me want to keep going.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.696
My existence was tortured by monotony,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.736
a reality that was often too much to bear.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.896
Alone with my thoughts,
I constructed intricate fantasies

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.296
about ants running across the floor.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.416
I taught myself to tell the time
by noticing where the shadows were.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.576
As I learned how the shadows moved
as the hours of the day passed,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.256
I understood how long it would be
before I was picked up and taken home.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.536
Seeing my father walk
through the door to collect me

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.720
was the best moment of the day.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.936
My mind became a tool that I could use

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.776
to either close down
to retreat from my reality

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.776
or enlarge into a gigantic space
that I could fill with fantasies.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.776
I hoped that my reality would change

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.656
and someone would see
that I had come back to life.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.376
But I had been washed away
like a sand castle

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.536
built too close to the waves,

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.736
and in my place was the person
people expected me to be.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.536
To some I was Martin,
a vacant shell, the vegetable,

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.976
deserving of harsh words,
dismissal and even abuse.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.936
To others, I was the tragically
brain-damaged boy

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.176
who had grown to become a man.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.376
Someone they were kind to and cared for.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.896
Good or bad, I was a blank canvas

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.240
onto which different versions
of myself were projected.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.456
It took someone new
to see me in a different way.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.736
An aromatherapist began coming
to the care home about once a week.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.736
Whether through intuition
or her attention to details

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.776
that others failed to notice,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.936
she became convinced that I could
understand what was being said.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.456
She urged my parents
to have me tested by experts

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.776
in augmentative
and alternative communication.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.016
And within a year,

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.096
I was beginning to use
a computer program to communicate.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.856
It was exhilarating,
but frustrating at times.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.856
I had so many words in my mind,

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.696
that I couldn't wait
to be able to share them.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.456
Sometimes, I would say things to myself
simply because I could.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.096
In myself, I had a ready audience,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.256
and I believed that by expressing
my thoughts and wishes,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.016
others would listen, too.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.296
But as I began to communicate more,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.496
I realized that it was in fact
only just the beginning

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.456
of creating a new voice for myself.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.816
I was thrust into a world
I didn't quite know how to function in.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.496
I stopped going to the care home

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.376
and managed to get my first job
making photocopies.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.856
As simple as this may sound,
it was amazing.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.896
My new world was really exciting

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.736
but often quite overwhelming
and frightening.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.576
I was like a man-child,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.696
and as liberating as it often was,

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.456
I struggled.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.016
I also learned that many of those
who had known me for a long time

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.696
found it impossible to abandon the idea
of Martin they had in their heads.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.336
While those I had only just met

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.120
struggled to look past the image
of a silent man in a wheelchair.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.736
I realized that some people
would only listen to me

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.776
if what I said was in line
with what they expected.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.816
Otherwise, it was disregarded

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.496
and they did what they felt was best.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.536
I discovered that true communication

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.376
is about more than merely
physically conveying a message.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.360
It is about getting the message
heard and respected.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.216
Still, things were going well.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.816
My body was slowly getting stronger.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.296
I had a job in computing that I loved,

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.216
and had even got Kojak, the dog
I had been dreaming about for years.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.176
However, I longed to share
my life with someone.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.616
I remember staring out the window
as my dad drove me home from work,

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.336
thinking I have so much love inside of me
and nobody to give it to.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.816
Just as I had resigned myself
to being single for the rest of my life,

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.616
I met Joan.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.096
Not only is she the best thing
that has ever happened to me,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.016
but Joan helped me to challenge
my own misconceptions about myself.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.656
Joan said it was through my words
that she fell in love with me.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.456
However, after all I had been through,

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.216
I still couldn't shake the belief

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.456
that nobody could truly see
beyond my disability

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.056
and accept me for who I am.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.256
I also really struggled
to comprehend that I was a man.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.096
The first time someone
referred to me as a man,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.416
it stopped me in my tracks.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.056
I felt like looking around
and asking, "Who, me?"

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.256
That all changed with Joan.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.856
We have an amazing connection

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.536
and I learned how important it is
to communicate openly and honestly.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.496
I felt safe, and it gave me the confidence
to truly say what I thought.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.816
I started to feel whole again,
a man worthy of love.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.296
I began to reshape my destiny.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.536
I spoke up a little more at work.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.936
I asserted my need for independence
to the people around me.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.816
Being given a means of communication
changed everything.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.056
I used the power of words and will
to challenge the preconceptions

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.656
of those around me
and those I had of myself.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.376
Communication is what makes us human,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.696
enabling us to connect
on the deepest level

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.656
with those around us --

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.256
telling our own stories,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.896
expressing wants, needs and desires,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.056
or hearing those of others
by really listening.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.416
All this is how the world
knows who we are.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.240
So who are we without it?

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.656
True communication increases understanding

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.720
and creates a more caring
and compassionate world.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.896
Once, I was perceived
to be an inanimate object,

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.216
a mindless phantom
of a boy in a wheelchair.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.496
Today, I am so much more.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.936
A husband, a son, a friend,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.216
a brother, a business owner,
a first-class honors graduate,

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.576
a keen amateur photographer.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.440
It is my ability to communicate
that has given me all this.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.016
We are told that actions
speak louder than words.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.976
But I wonder,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.200
do they?

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.536
Our words, however we communicate them,

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.656
are just as powerful.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.416
Whether we speak the words
with our own voices,

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.776
type them with our eyes,

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.056
or communicate them non-verbally
to someone who speaks them for us,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.960
words are among our most powerful tools.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.216
I have come to you through
a terrible darkness,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.336
pulled from it by caring souls

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.696
and by language itself.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.736
The act of you listening to me today
brings me farther into the light.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.056
We are shining here together.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.376
If there is one most difficult obstacle
to my way of communicating,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.336
it is that sometimes I want to shout

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.656
and other times simply to whisper
a word of love or gratitude.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.936
It all sounds the same.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.376
But if you will,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.160
please imagine these next two words
as warmly as you can:

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.680
Thank you.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:07.080
(Applause)
